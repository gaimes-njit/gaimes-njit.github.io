Task: Generate a command using the function ab_drop(block_type, x) to make a grid of falling blocks that resembles the letter <OBJECT>. The function ab_drop(block_type, x) takes in two arguments: block_type, which specifies the type of block to drop ('b11', 'b13', or 'b31'), and x, which specifies the horizontal position of the block.

Example Usage to form letter L:

To form letter L, we need to form the horizontal part(use b31) and vertical part(use b13) of L.

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Drop a 3x1 block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Drop a 1x3 block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Drop a 1x3 block at position 2
```

First we drop a b31 at position 3, to form the horizontal part of L. Then we drop 2 b13 blocks to form the vertical part of L. Then we complete the letter L.

Example Usage to form letter M:

To form letter M, we need to form the vertical part(use b13) 3 times and then vertical part(use b31) 2 times.

```
ab_drop('b13', 6)   #Drop a 1x3 block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 8)   #Drop a 1x3 block at position 8
ab_drop('b13', 10)  #Drop a 1x3 block at position 10
ab_drop('b31', 7)   #Drop a 3x1 block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 9)   #Drop a 3x1 block at position 9
```

Example Usage to form letter N:

To form letter N, we need to form the vertical part(use b13) 2 times and then vertical part(use b31) 1 time.

```
ab_drop('b13', 6)   #Drop a 1x3 block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 8)   #Drop a 1x3 block at position 8
ab_drop('b31', 7)   #Drop a 3x1 block at position 7
```

A Counter Example Usage to form letter N:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Drop a 1x3 block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Drop a 3x1 block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 4)    # Drop a 1x3 block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)    # Drop a 3x1 block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 7)    # Drop a 1x3 block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 8)    # Drop a 3x1 block at position 8
ab_drop('b13', 10)   # Drop a 1x3 block at position 10
ab_drop('b31', 11)   # Drop a 3x1 block at position 11
ab_drop('b13', 13)   # Drop a 1x3 block at position 13
ab_drop('b31', 14)   # Drop a 3x1 block at position 14
ab_drop('b13', 16)   # Drop a 1x3 block at position 16
ab_drop('b31', 17)   # Drop a 3x1 block at position 17
```


Instructions:

Please generate a series of ab_drop commands to create a falling block grid that resembles the letter <OBJECT>. The blocks should fall from the top of the grid to the bottom, and the blocks should be positioned such that they form the shape of the letter <OBJECT>.

Note that the block types available are 'b11' (a 1x1 block), 'b13' (a 1x3 block), and 'b31' (a 3x1 block). You should use these block types to construct the <OBJECT> shape.

Please provide your commands in the following format, and make sure to enclose the commands within a code block (triple backticks with "python" following the opening backticks):

ab_drop('block_type_1', x_1)
ab_drop('block_type_2', x_2)
...
ab_drop('block_type_n', x_n)
Note: The function ab_drop() is designed to make the blocks fall down like Tetris blocks.

Please keep in mind the following additional requirements:

The block types must be enclosed in single quotes in the ab_drop() function call.
Your generated code should be enclosed in a code block.
The available grid space is 20 blocks wide and 16 blocks high.
The blocks should fall down like in Tetris.
The x value in the ab_drop() function call starts from 0 and goes up to 19, representing the horizontal position of the block.
The 'b13' block type has a width of 1 and a height of 3.
The 'b31' block type has a width of 3 and a height of 1, the horizontal position of b31 stand for the center block of b31, which means if the horizontal position of b31 is 3, then b31 will occupy 2, 3, 4 three horizontal position.
You should disassemble the letter <OBJECT> into vertical and horizontal lines and then apply the block from left to right to reassemble it.
The final block shape as a whole should look like the letter <OBJECT>.
It is also important to ensure that this shape is stable and can withstand the effects of gravity. 
Think about the differences of each type of block to assemble the shape <OBJECT>.
NOTE: You cannot put the 'b31' block at position 0 or position 19. 
NOTE: You cannot use more than 4 'b13' blocks.
To avoid exceeding the boundary, you should use the middle number between 1-18 as the position.
Please provide your solution in one round of dialogue.
Use as few blocks as possible.
You can not use loop.
Think about this step by step.
