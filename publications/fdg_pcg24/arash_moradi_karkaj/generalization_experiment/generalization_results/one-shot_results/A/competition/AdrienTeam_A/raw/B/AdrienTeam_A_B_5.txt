The code to generate the structure resembling "B" using the `ab_drop()` function, while adhering to the given constraints, is as follows:

```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop blocks to form the base of "B"
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Drop blocks to form the vertical stem of "B"
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Drop blocks to form the left corner of "B"
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Drop blocks to form the diagonal part of "B"
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 6)

# Drop blocks to form the right corner of "B"
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 3)

# Drop blocks to form the top part of "B"
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)

```

Please note that the above code assumes that the `ab_drop()` function is defined and can be used within the code. Additionally, the final structure might require adjustments to achieve a more realistic and proportional shape for the "B".
