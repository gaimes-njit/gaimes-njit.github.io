The following `ab_drop()` calls will generate a stable structure resembling the letter "C" while adhering to the given constraints:

```
ab_drop('b11',0)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',0)
```

These calls will build the "C" structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15), following the constraints of the task. The blocks are dropped in a specific order and position to achieve the desired shape.
