To create a stable structure resembling "D" while satisfying the given constraints, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

This sequence of calls will drop the blocks in a specific order and position to form the shape of "D" while adhering to the constraints.
