Here is one possible solution to create a stable structure resembling "D":

```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 12)
ab_drop('b11', 12)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```

This solution starts by placing a horizontal block `b31` at slot 0, representing the first leg of the "D". Then, two vertical blocks `b11` are placed on top of each other at slot 1 to represent the vertical stroke of the "D". A vertical block `b13` is placed at slot 2 to complete the vertical stroke.

Next, a horizontal block `b31` is placed at slot 2 to create the horizontal stroke of the "D". Then, two horizontal blocks `b11` are placed on top of each other at slot 4 to extend the horizontal stroke. Another horizontal block `b31` is placed at slot 3 to complete the horizontal stroke.

Finally, the remaining blocks are placed to create the diagonal stroke of the "D" and complete its shape.

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls ensures that the structure is stable, adheres to the given constraints, and resembles the letter "D".
