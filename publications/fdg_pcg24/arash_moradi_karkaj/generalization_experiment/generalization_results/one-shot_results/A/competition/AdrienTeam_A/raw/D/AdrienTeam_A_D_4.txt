To create a stable structure resembling "D" while satisfying the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the map:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base of "D":
```python
ab_drop('b11',9)
```

3. Place the vertical line of "D":
```python
ab_drop('b31',10)
ab_drop('b11',9)
ab_drop('b11',8)
```

4. Place the horizontal line of "D":
```python
ab_drop('b11',7)
ab_drop('b13',7)
ab_drop('b11',8)
ab_drop('b11',9)
```

The complete code block for generating the structure resembling "D" would be:

```python
ab_drop('b11',9)
ab_drop('b31',10)
ab_drop('b11',9)
ab_drop('b11',8)
ab_drop('b11',7)
ab_drop('b13',7)
ab_drop('b11',8)
ab_drop('b11',9)
```

Note: It's important to understand that the given constraints restrict certain combination of blocks and positions that can be used. Therefore, the resulting structure may not be an exact mirror-image of the letter "D" due to these limitations.
