To construct a stable structure resembling "D" while satisfying the given constraints, we can use the following `ab_drop()` function calls:

```
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop a block with width 1 and height 1 at slot 9
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop another block with width 1 and height 1 at slot 9
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop a vertical block with width 1 and height 3 at slot 9
ab_drop('b11', 10) # Drop a block with width 1 and height 1 at slot 10
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop a horizontal block with width 3 and height 1 at slot 9
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop another block with width 1 and height 1 at slot 9
ab_drop('b11', 11) # Drop a block with width 1 and height 1 at slot 11
```

These `ab_drop()` calls will create a stable structure resembling the letter "D" while satisfying the given constraints.
