To create a stable structure resembling "E", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

This sequence of calls will drop the blocks in the correct order and position to form the shape of the letter "E", while adhering to the given constraints.
