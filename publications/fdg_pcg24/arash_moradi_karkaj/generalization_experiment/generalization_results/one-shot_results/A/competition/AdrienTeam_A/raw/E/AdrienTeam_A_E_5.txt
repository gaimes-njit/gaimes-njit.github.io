To create a structure resembling the letter "E", we need to carefully drop the blocks using the `ab_drop()` function while adhering to the given constraints. Here is one possible solution:

```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will generate a stable structure resembling the letter "E" with the following layout:

```
 _______
|       |
|       |
|___    |
|       |
|       |
|______ |
```

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid combinations of `ab_drop()` calls that can generate the desired structure.
