To create a stable structure resembling the letter "E", we need to carefully plan the placement of the blocks to meet the given constraints. Here is one possible solution:

```
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# drop the first vertical block
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# drop the first horizontal block
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# drop the second vertical block
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# drop the second horizontal block (the middle part of 'E')
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# drop the third vertical block
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# drop the horizontal block for the top of 'E'
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# drop the third vertical block for the right side of 'E'
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# drop the horizontal block for the bottom of 'E'
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# drop the last vertical block for the middle of 'E'
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```
This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will create a stable structure resembling the letter "E" while satisfying all the specified constraints.
