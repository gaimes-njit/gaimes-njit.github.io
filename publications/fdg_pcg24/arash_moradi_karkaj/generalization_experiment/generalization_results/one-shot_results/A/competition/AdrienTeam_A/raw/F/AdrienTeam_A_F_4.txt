To create a stable structure resembling "F", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the empty structure grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Next, we can drop the blocks in the following order:

- Drop a vertical block in slot 0 and 1 to form the lower vertical part of the "F":
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

- Drop a horizontal block in slot 0 and 1 to connect the lower vertical part of the "F":
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

- Drop a vertical block in slot 1 and 2 to form the upper vertical part of the "F":
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

- Drop a horizontal block in slot 0 and 1 to connect the upper vertical part of the "F":
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

- Drop a horizontal block in slot 1 and 2 to form the top horizontal part of the "F":
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

3. Once all the blocks are dropped, the structure will resemble the letter "F".

The code block representing the ab_drop() calls is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```
