The structure can be built by following these steps:

1. Drop the first block ('b13') at slot 0 to construct the bottom part of the "F":
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

2. Drop the second block ('b11') at slot 0, just above the previous block, to construct the middle part of the "F":
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 0)
   ```

3. Drop the third block ('b31') at slot 1, just to the right of the previous block, to complete the middle part of the "F":
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

4. Drop the fourth block ('b11') at slot 0, above the previous blocks, to construct the top part of the "F":
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 0)
   ```

The final list of `ab_drop()` inputs to create the "F" structure is:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```
