Here is one way to generate the structure resembling "G" using the `ab_drop()` function:

```
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' '] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the blocks to form the structure
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid ways to achieve the same shape using different sequences of `ab_drop()` calls.
