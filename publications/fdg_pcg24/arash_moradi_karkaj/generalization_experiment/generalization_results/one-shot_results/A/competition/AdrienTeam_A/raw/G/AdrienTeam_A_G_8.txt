To construct a stable structure resembling "G" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure with an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block ('b31') at slot 0 to create the vertical part of the "G":
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Drop two blocks ('b11') at slot 0 and slot 2 to create the horizontal part of the "G":
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

4. Drop two blocks ('b11') at slot 0 and slot 2 to create the lower part of the "G":
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

5. Drop a block ('b31') at slot 1 to complete the structure of the "G":
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Overall, the sequence of `ab_drop()` calls to create the "G" structure would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
