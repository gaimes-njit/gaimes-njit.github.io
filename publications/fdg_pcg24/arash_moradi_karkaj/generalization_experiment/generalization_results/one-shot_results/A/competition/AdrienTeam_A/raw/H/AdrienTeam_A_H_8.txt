To create a stable structure resembling "H", we can start by dropping the blocks from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15). We will use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks vertically, ensuring that the constraints are met. 

Here is the sequence of `ab_drop()` calls to create the structure:

```
ab_drop('b11', 0)   # Drop a square block at slot 0
ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Drop a square block at slot 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Drop a square block at slot 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Drop a square block at slot 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Drop a horizontal block at slot 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Drop a square block at slot 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Drop a square block at slot 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Drop a horizontal block at slot 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Drop a square block at slot 2
```

These `ab_drop()` calls will create a stable structure resembling "H" that satisfies all the specified constraints.
