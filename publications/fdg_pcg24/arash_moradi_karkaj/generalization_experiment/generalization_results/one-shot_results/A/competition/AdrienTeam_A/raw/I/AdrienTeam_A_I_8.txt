To create a stable structure resembling the letter "I", we need to consider the given constraints and use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks vertically. Here is one possible solution:

```
# Map initialization
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks based on the given constraints
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```
