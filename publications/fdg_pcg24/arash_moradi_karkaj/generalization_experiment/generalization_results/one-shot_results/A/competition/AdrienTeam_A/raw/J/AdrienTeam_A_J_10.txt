The solution to create a stable structure resembling "J" using the `ab_drop()` function while adhering to the given constraints is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
```

Explanation:
1. The first block dropped is `'b13'` at slot 0.
2. The second block dropped is `'b11'` at slot 1.
3. The third block dropped is `'b11'` at slot 2.
