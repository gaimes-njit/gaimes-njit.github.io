Here is one possible solution to generate the structure resembling "J" while meeting the given constraints:

```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

Explanation:
- First, we drop two 'b11' blocks on slots 0 and 0 to form the bottom-left corner of the "J" shape.
- Next, we drop a 'b13' block on slot 2 to form the vertical part of the "J" shape.
- Then, we drop a 'b31' block on slot 1 to connect the vertical part with the horizontal part of the "J" shape.
- Finally, we drop another 'b11' block on slot 1 to complete the horizontal part of the "J" shape.

This sequence of `ab_drop()` inputs ensures that the blocks are dropped from bottom to top, adhering to the gravity constraint. The blocks are also placed within the map boundaries and the y-coordinates correspond to the block centers.
