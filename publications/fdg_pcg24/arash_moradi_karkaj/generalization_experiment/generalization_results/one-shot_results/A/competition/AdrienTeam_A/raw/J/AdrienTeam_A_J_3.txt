To create a stable structure resembling "J" and satisfy all the specified constraints, we can use the following `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

This sequence of calls will drop the blocks in the correct order and position to create the "J" shape. The first call drops a horizontal block, followed by three vertical blocks to complete the shape.
