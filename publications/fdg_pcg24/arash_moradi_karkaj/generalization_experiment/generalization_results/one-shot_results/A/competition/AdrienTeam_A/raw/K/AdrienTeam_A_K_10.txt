The structure for the letter "K" can be generated using the following code:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b31', 9) # Drop the horizontal block to form the top part of the "K"
ab_drop('b11', 9) # Drop the first vertical block to form the middle part of the "K"
ab_drop('b11', 9) # Drop the second vertical block to complete the middle part of the "K"
ab_drop('b13', 9) # Drop the third vertical block to form the bottom part of the "K"
```

This code will generate a structure that resembles the letter "K" with the blocks placed in the appropriate positions. The blocks are dropped in a sequential order to ensure that the structure is stable and satisfies all the given constraints.
