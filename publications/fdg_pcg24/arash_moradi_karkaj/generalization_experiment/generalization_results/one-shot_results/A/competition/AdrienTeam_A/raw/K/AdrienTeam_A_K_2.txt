Here is the code block with the `ab_drop()` function calls to create a stable structure resembling "K":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
To create the "K" structure, the blocks are dropped in the following order:
1. Drop a horizontal block (`b31`) in the center slot (`1`) to form the vertical stroke of the "K".
2. Drop a vertical block (`b11`) in the leftmost slot (`0`) to form the top part of the horizontal stroke.
3. Drop another vertical block (`b11`) in the rightmost slot (`2`) to form the bottom part of the horizontal stroke.
4. Drop a vertical block (`b11`) in the center slot (`1`) to complete the horizontal stroke.
5. Drop another horizontal block (`b11`) in the leftmost slot (`0`) to reinforce the top part of the horizontal stroke.
6. Drop a vertical block (`b13`) in the rightmost slot (`2`) to bridge the gap between the top and bottom parts of the horizontal stroke.
7. Drop a vertical block (`b11`) in the leftmost slot (`0`) to reinforce the top part of the horizontal stroke.
8. Drop another vertical block (`b11`) in the rightmost slot (`2`) to reinforce the bottom part of the horizontal stroke.
9. Drop a horizontal block (`b31`) in the center slot (`1`) to connect the vertical and horizontal strokes of the "K".

These `ab_drop()` function calls ensure that the generated structure resembles the letter "K" and satisfies the given constraints.
