Here is an example to create a stable structure resembling "M" using the `ab_drop()` function:

```
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks to form the "M" shape
ab_drop('b11', 0)      # bottom left block
ab_drop('b11', 2)      # bottom right block
ab_drop('b31', 1)      # middle block
ab_drop('b11', 0)      # top left block
ab_drop('b11', 2)      # top right block
```

Please note that the above code only drops 5 blocks to form the "M" shape. You may need to add more `ab_drop()` calls to complete the structure according to the given constraints and desired shape.
