The structure resembling "M" can be built using the following `ab_drop()` function calls:

```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. Drop a block of type 'b11' centered at slot 0. This will form the leftmost part of the "M".
2. Drop a block of type 'b11' centered at slot 2. This will form the middle part of the "M".
3. Drop a block of type 'b11' centered at slot 4. This will form the rightmost part of the "M".
4. Drop a block of type 'b11' centered at slot 2. This will form the middle part of the "M".
5. Drop a block of type 'b11' centered at slot 0. This will form the leftmost part of the "M".
6. Drop a block of type 'b11' centered at slot 2. This will form the middle part of the "M".
7. Drop a block of type 'b31' centered at slot 2. This will connect the leftmost and middle parts of the "M".

These `ab_drop()` function calls will create a stable structure resembling the letter "M" while satisfying the specified constraints.
