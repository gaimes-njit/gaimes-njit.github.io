The given constraints and information can be used to construct the structure resembling "N". The blocks should be dropped in a specific order and position to ensure the stability and adherence to the constraints.

Here is the code to generate the structure:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the base of the "N"
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Drop the vertical block of the "N"
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Drop the horizontal block of the "N"
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

The above code will create a structure resembling "N" by dropping the blocks in the specified order and position while adhering to the given constraints.
