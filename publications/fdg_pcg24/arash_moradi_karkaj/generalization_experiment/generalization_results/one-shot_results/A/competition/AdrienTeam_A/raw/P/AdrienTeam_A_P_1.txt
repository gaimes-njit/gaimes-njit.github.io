The "P" structure can be built using the following `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

The `ab_drop('b13', 0)` call drops the vertical block to create the vertical line of the "P". Then, the `ab_drop('b11', 0)` and `ab_drop('b11', 1)` calls drop the two blocks to create the horizontal line of the "P". Finally, the remaining `ab_drop('b11', x)` calls drop the three blocks to complete the top of the "P".

The order of the blocks being dropped is crucial to ensure stability and adherence to the given constraints.
