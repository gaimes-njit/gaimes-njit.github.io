The structure of the "P" character can be created using the following sequence of `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

This sequence ensures that the blocks are dropped in the correct order and in the correct slots to form the shape of the letter "P".
