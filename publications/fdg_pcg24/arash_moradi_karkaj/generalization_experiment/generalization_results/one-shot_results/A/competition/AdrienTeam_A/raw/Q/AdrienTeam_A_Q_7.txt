To create a structure resembling "Q", we need to follow the given constraints and drop the blocks in a specific order and position. Here is a possible solution:

```
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks to create "Q"
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Print the structure
for row in structure:
    print(row)
```

This solution aligns the blocks to create a structure resembling the letter "Q" using the three available block types. The blocks are dropped in a specific order and position to satisfy the given constraints. The resulting structure is printed at the end.
