To construct the "R" structure, we can follow the given constraints and guidelines as follows:

1. Start building from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15).
2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks vertically.
3. Rotate the 'L' character if necessary to achieve the desired shape.
4. Pay attention to the order and position of the blocks being dropped. The order and orientation of the `ab_drop()` inputs are crucial.
5. Avoid using `ab_drop('b31',0)` as it is prohibited.
6. Aim for a realistic and proportional shape for the "R".
7. Generate the structure using a single figure, meaning only one set of `ab_drop()` inputs.

With these guidelines in mind, we can proceed to construct the "R" structure:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

Please note that the exact slot positions may vary slightly depending on the desired positioning and alignment of the "R" structure. The provided input serves as a starting point and can be adjusted as needed to achieve the desired shape.
