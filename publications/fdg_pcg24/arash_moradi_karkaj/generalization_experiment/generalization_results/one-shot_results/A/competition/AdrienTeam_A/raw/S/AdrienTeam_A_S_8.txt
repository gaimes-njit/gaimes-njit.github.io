First, let's initialize the map:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

To build the "S" structure, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a vertical block ('b13') at the leftmost slot (0) and align it with the bottom layer (layer 0):
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

2. Next, drop a horizontal block ('b31') centered on slot 1 in the bottom layer (layer 0):
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Move up to layer 1 and drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 0, aligning its center:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Move up to layer 2 and drop a horizontal block ('b31') centered on slot 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

5. Move up to layer 3 and drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 0, aligning its center:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

6. Move up to layer 4 and drop a horizontal block ('b31') centered on slot 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

7. Move up to layer 5 and drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 2, aligning its center:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

8. Move up to layer 6 and drop a horizontal block ('b31') centered on slot 0:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

9. Move up to layer 7 and drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 2, aligning its center:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

10. Move up to layer 8 and drop a horizontal block ('b31') centered on slot 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

11. Move up to layer 9 and drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 0, aligning its center:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

12. Move up to layer 10 and drop a horizontal block ('b31') centered on slot 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

13. Move up to layer 11 and drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 0, aligning its center:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

14. Move up to layer 12 and drop a horizontal block ('b31') centered on slot 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

15. Move up to layer 13 and drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 2, aligning its center:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

16. Move up to layer 14 and drop a horizontal block ('b31') centered on slot 0:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

17. Move up to layer 15 and drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 2, aligning its center:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will create a stable structure resembling the letter "S".
