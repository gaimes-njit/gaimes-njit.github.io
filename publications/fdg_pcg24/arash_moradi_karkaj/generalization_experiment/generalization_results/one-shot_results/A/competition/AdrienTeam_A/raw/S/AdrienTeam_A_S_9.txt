To create a stable structure resembling "S" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the map by creating an empty grid of size `WxH` using the following code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15) using the `ab_drop()` function.

3. Determine the order and position of the blocks being dropped to form the "S" shape. We can utilize the given constraints and examples for reference.

4. Output the `ab_drop()` calls within a code block (` ``` `) to display the sequence of block drops.

Based on the provided information, here is one possible solution to generate the "S" structure:

```
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

By rearranging and expanding this structure, we can obtain the desired shape of "S".
