The structure of the "T" can be constructed by using the `ab_drop()` function with the following inputs:

```
# Place the bottom horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Place the vertical block on top of the bottom horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Place the horizontal blocks on top of the vertical block
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` inputs will generate the structure of the "T" as a stable and continuous figure while satisfying all the specified constraints.
