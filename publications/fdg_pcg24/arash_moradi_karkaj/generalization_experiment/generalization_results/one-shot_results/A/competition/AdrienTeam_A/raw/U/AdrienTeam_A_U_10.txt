To build the structure resembling a "U" shape, we can use the `ab_drop()` function and follow these steps:

1. Drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 0 to create the left side of the "U" shape:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

2. Drop a horizontal block ('b31') at slot 1 to create the top part of the "U" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 2 to create the right side of the "U" shape:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

The complete code for generating the "U" structure is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
