To create a stable structure resembling "W" while satisfying the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Start building the "W" shape from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15).

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks vertically, aligning their centers with the desired slots.

4. Follow the given constraints:
   - No boundary intrusion: Ensure that the blocks do not extend beyond the map boundaries.
   - The y-coordinate should correspond to the block's center.

5. Aim for a realistic and proportional shape for the "W".

Based on the provided hint for the "A" shape, we can modify the order and positions of the blocks to create a structure resembling "W". Here is a possible solution:

```
# Initialize the structure grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop blocks to create the "W" shape
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Drop vertical block at slot 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Drop vertical block at slot 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Drop horizontal block at slot 2

# Output the dropped blocks as ab_drop() inputs
```

Note: The above solution is just one possible way to create a structure resembling "W" while adhering to the given constraints. Depending on the desired shape and proportions, alternative solutions may exist. Feel free to experiment and adjust the order and positions of the blocks to achieve the desired result.
