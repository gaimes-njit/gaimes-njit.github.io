Here is the code to generate the structure resembling "X" while adhering to the given constraints:

```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "X" with the provided block types. Each call represents dropping a block vertically from the specified layer and aligning its center with the given slot position. The blocks are dropped from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15) while taking into account gravity.
