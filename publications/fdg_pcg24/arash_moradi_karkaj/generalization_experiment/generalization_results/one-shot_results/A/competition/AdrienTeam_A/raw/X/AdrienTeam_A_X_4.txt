The following is an example of how to use the `ab_drop()` function to create a stable structure resembling "X" while satisfying the given constraints:

```
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop blocks to construct "X"
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 19)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 18)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 17)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

Note: The above code is just an example to illustrate how to use the `ab_drop()` function to create a structure resembling "X" while meeting the given constraints. The specific positions and order of the blocks may vary depending on the desired shape of the "X" structure.
