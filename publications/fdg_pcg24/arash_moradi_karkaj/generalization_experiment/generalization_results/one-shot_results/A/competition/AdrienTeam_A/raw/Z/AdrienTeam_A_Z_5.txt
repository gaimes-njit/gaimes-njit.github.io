To create a stable structure resembling "Z" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure: Create an empty grid with dimensions WxH using the following code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start building the "Z" shape from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15).

3. Drop the first block ('b13') to form the vertical part of the "Z" shape. Place it at the center slot (slot 9) using the `ab_drop('b13', 9)` command.

4. Drop the second block ('b31') to form the horizontal part of the "Z" shape. Place it one slot to the left (slot 8) using the `ab_drop('b31', 8)` command.

5. Drop the third block ('b13') to complete the vertical part of the "Z" shape. Place it one slot to the left (slot 7) using the `ab_drop('b13', 7)` command.

6. Finally, output the `ab_drop()` calls for all the blocks dropped as a list in a code block. The resulting code would look like this:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will create a stable structure resembling the shape "Z" while satisfying all the specified constraints.
