To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code: `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Drop the b31 block at the center of the bottom layer (layer 0) to form the base. This will act as the stable support for the entire structure. Use the `ab_drop()` function with `x = 'b31'` and `y = W // 2`.

3. Drop the b13 block on top of the base, slightly offset to the left. This will form the left part of the 'A' shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function with `x = 'b13'` and `y = W // 2 - 1`.

4. Drop another b13 block on top of the base, slightly offset to the right. This will form the right part of the 'A' shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function with `x = 'b13'` and `y = W // 2 + 1`.

5. Drop a b11 block on top of the two b13 blocks, exactly on the center slot. This will form the middle part of the 'A' shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function with `x = 'b11'` and `y = W // 2`.

6. Drop a b11 block on top of the middle part of the 'A' shape, slightly offset to the left. This will form the slant of the 'A' shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function with `x = 'b11'` and `y = W // 2 - 1`.

7. Drop another b11 block on top of the middle part of the 'A' shape, slightly offset to the right. This will complete the slant of the 'A' shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function with `x = 'b11'` and `y = W // 2 + 1`.

8. Finally, drop a b11 block on top of the slant of the 'A' shape, on the center slot. This will form the top part of the 'A' shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function with `x = 'b11'` and `y = W // 2`.

By following these steps, we will generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A" and meets all the hard constraints.
