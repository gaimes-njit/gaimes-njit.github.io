To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Use the `ab_drop()` function with appropriate parameters to drop the blocks and build the structure. Make sure to follow the hard constraints and check for stability before each call to `ab_drop()`. The goal is to build the structure from bottom to top, similar to building blocks.
Here's an example implementation to generate the structure:
```python
# Drop the b11 block at slot 2 (centered) on layer 0
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Drop the b31 block at slot 1 (centered) on layer 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Drop the b31 block at slot 1 (centered) on layer 4
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Drop the b31 block at slot 1 (centered) on layer 7
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Drop the b31 block at slot 1 (centered) on layer 10
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Drop the b31 block at slot 1 (centered) on layer 13
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Drop the b13 block at slot 1 (centered) on layer 3
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Drop the b13 block at slot 1 (centered) on layer 6
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Drop the b13 block at slot 1 (centered) on layer 9
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Drop the b13 block at slot 1 (centered) on layer 12
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. After executing the above code, you will have the structure that resembles the uppercase character "D" in the `structure` variable. You can print the structure using the following code:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Note: The above implementation is just one way to generate the structure. There could be multiple valid structures that meet the hard constraints and resemble the uppercase character "D". The goal is to ensure stability, follow the constraints, and create a diverse structure.
