To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "G", we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Generate the stable base of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place a vertical block at slot 9
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place a horizontal block above the vertical block at slot 9
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place another horizontal block to the left of the previous block at slot 7
```

3. Generate the upper part of the G shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place a vertical block above the rightmost block at slot 5
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place a horizontal block above the vertical block at slot 5
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place another horizontal block to the left of the previous block at slot 3
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical block above the leftmost block at slot 3
```

Note: The exact coordinates for each `ab_drop` call have been determined based on the constraints and the desired shape of the G. These coordinates may vary depending on the specific requirements or constraints of the problem.

After following these steps, the `structure` grid will contain the generated stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "G".
