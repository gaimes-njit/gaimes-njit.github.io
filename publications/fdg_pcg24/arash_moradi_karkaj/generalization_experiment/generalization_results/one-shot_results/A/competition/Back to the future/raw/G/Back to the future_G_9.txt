To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "G", we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base of the "G". Since the base is a horizontal block, we can drop a b31 block at the center slot by calling `ab_drop("b31", (W-1)//2)`. This will place the block at layer 14.

3. Place the U-shaped part of the "G". We can drop two b13 blocks vertically aligned at the middle slot of the previous b31 block. Call `ab_drop("b13", (W-1)//2-1)` to drop the first block at layer 13, and then call `ab_drop("b13", (W-1)//2+1)` to drop the second block at layer 13.

4. Place the top horizontal part of the "G". We can drop a b31 block horizontally aligned with the U-shaped part at layer 12. Call `ab_drop("b31", (W-1)//2)`.

The final structure should resemble the uppercase character "G" and meet the stability constraint.

Note: The code provided assumes that the `ab_drop()` function already handles checking for stability and updating the structure grid accordingly.
