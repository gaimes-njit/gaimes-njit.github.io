To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "K" using the given `ab_drop()` function and meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define a function `is_stable()` to check the stability of the current structure. This function should take the x and y coordinates of the recently dropped block and return True if the structure is stable or False otherwise. To determine stability, we need to check if the block and its support blocks form a stable structure using the block-stacking problem techniques.

3. Implement the logic to generate the stable structure:
   - First, we need to drop a b13 block to form the left vertical part of the "K". We can use `ab_drop('b13', 4)` to drop the block at slot 4 (aligned center) and store the drop coordinates.
   - Next, we need to drop a b31 block on top of the b13 block to form the horizontal part of the "K". We can use `ab_drop('b31', drop_pos[1])` to drop the block aligned with the previous drop position and store the drop coordinates.
   - Now, we need to drop another b13 block on top of the previous b31 block to form the right vertical part of the "K". We can use `ab_drop('b13', drop_pos[1])` to drop the block aligned with the previous drop position and store the drop coordinates.
   - Finally, we need to drop another b31 block on top of the previous b13 block to complete the horizontal top part of the "K". We can use `ab_drop('b31', drop_pos[1])` to drop the block aligned with the previous drop position and store the drop coordinates.

4. Apply stability checks before each `ab_drop()` call by calling the `is_stable()` function. If the structure is not stable, adjust the drop position or choose a different block type to ensure stability.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 multiple times to generate diverse structures that resemble the uppercase character "K".

Note: The exact implementation logic for stability checks and adjusting the drop position may vary depending on the specific block-stacking techniques used and the stability criteria defined.
