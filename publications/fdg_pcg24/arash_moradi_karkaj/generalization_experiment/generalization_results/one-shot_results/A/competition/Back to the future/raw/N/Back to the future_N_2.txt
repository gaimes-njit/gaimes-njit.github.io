To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "N" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) upward. 

3. Drop the first b31 block at slots 4, 5, and 6 to form the base of the "N" structure. To ensure stability, check if the block is supported by the structure at the drop position (2, 5). If not, drop a b11 block at slot 5 to provide support.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Drop b31 block at slot 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Drop b31 block at slot 5
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Drop b31 block at slot 6

# Check for stability and provide support
if structure[2][5] == ' ':
    ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Drop b11 block at slot 5 to provide support
```

4. Drop a b31 block at slots 4, 5, and 6 at layer 1 to create the second layer of the "N" structure. Again, check for stability and provide support if needed.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Drop b31 block at slot 4, layer 1
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Drop b31 block at slot 5, layer 1
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Drop b31 block at slot 6, layer 1

# Check for stability and provide support
if structure[0][5] == ' ':
    ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Drop b11 block at slot 5 to provide support
```

5. Drop a b11 block at slot 5 at layer 2 to create the connecting part of the "N" structure. This block ensures stability for the upper part.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Drop b11 block at slot 5, layer 2
```

6. Drop a b13 block at slots 3, 4, and 5 at layer 3 to create the vertical part of the "N" structure.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Drop b13 block at slot 3, layer 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Drop b13 block at slot 4, layer 3
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Drop b13 block at slot 5, layer 3
```

7. Check for stability and provide support for the upper part if needed.

8. Repeat steps 4-7 for the remaining layers until the desired height is reached.

By following these steps and making sure to check for stability and provide support as needed, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "N" while satisfying all the hard constraints.
