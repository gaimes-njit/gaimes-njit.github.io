To solve the problem, we need to iteratively call the `ab_drop()` function for each block type, starting from the bottom layer and moving upwards. We will follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.
2. Start from layer 15 (top layer) and iterate downwards until layer 0 (bottom layer).
3. For each layer, start from the leftmost slot (slot 0) and iterate towards the rightmost slot (slot W-1).
4. For each slot, check if the structure in the current layer and slot is empty. If not, continue to the next slot.
5. If the structure in the current layer and slot is empty, drop a block at that slot using `ab_drop()`.
6. After dropping a block, check the stability of the structure to ensure it does not collapse. If the structure is not stable, continue to the next slot.
7. If the structure is stable, continue to the next layer and repeat steps 4-7 until all layers and slots have been iterated over.
8. Once all the blocks have been dropped and the structure is stable, check if the resulting structure is similar to the uppercase letter "O".
9. If the resulting structure is not similar to "O", repeat the process from step 1 to generate a new structure.
10. Repeat step 9 until a satisfactory structure is generated.

Here is a sample code that implements the above steps:

```python
import random

def is_stable(structure):
    for row in range(1, len(structure)):
        for col in range(len(structure[0])):
            if structure[row][col] != ' ' and structure[row-1][col] == ' ':
                return False
    return True

def is_similar_to_O(structure):
    '''Check if the resulting structure is similar to the uppercase letter "O".'''
    # Compare the structure with the pattern of the letter "O"
    # You can define the pattern as a 2D list or a string and compare it to the structure
    # Return True if the structure matches the pattern, False otherwise
    ...
    
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Function to drop a block in the structure
    ...

W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]  # Initialize the structure as an empty grid

# Generate a stable and similar structure
while True:
    # Drop b31 block in layers 15 to 1
    for layer in range(H-1, 0, -1):
        for slot in range(W):
            if structure[layer][slot] == ' ':
                ab_drop('b31', slot)
                if not is_stable(structure):
                    break
                
    # Drop b13 block in layers 15 to 1
    for layer in range(H-1, 0, -1):
        for slot in range(W):
            if structure[layer][slot] == ' ':
                ab_drop('b13', slot)
                if not is_stable(structure):
                    break

    # Drop b11 block in layers 15 to 1
    for layer in range(H-1, 0, -1):
        for slot in range(W):
            if structure[layer][slot] == ' ':
                ab_drop('b11', slot)
                if not is_stable(structure):
                    break
    
    if is_similar_to_O(structure):
        break  # Exit the loop if a satisfactory structure is generated

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

Please note that the code provided here is a basic framework and requires the implementation of the stability check and similarity check functions (`is_stable()` and `is_similar_to_O()`) according to the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
