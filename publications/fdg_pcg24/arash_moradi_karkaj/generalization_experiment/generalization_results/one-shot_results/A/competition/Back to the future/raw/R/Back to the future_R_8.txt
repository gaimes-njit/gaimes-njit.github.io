To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given function `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Start by dropping the b31 block at the center of the structure using `ab_drop('b31', W//2)`. This will create the vertical part of the "R".

3. To create the horizontal part of the "R", drop b11 blocks starting from the top left corner and moving towards the bottom right corner. Use the `ab_drop('b11', y)` function, where y is the slot number.

   - Drop a b11 block at slot 0 on the top layer.
   - Drop a b11 block at slot 1 on the second layer.
   - Drop a b11 block at slot 2 on the third layer.
   - Repeat this process until reaching the bottom right corner.

4. To create the diagonal part of the "R", drop b13 blocks diagonally starting from the bottom left corner and moving towards the top right corner. Use the `ab_drop('b13', y)` function, where y is the slot number.

   - Drop a b13 block at slot 3 on the bottom layer.
   - Drop a b13 block at slot 4 on the second layer.
   - Drop a b13 block at slot 5 on the third layer.
   - Repeat this process until reaching the top right corner.

By following these steps and considering the stability constraints, you can generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "R". Remember to perform stability checks before each `ab_drop()` call to ensure the structure remains stable throughout the generation process.
