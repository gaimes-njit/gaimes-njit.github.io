To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "T" and meets all the hard constraints, the following steps can be followed:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid according to the provided code snippet.

2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) upwards.

3. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the b31 block at the center slot (y = 9) on layer 0. This will provide a stable base for the vertical part of the "T" shape.

4. Check the stability of the structure after each drop.

5. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the b11 block at the center slot (y = 9) on layer 1. This will create the vertical part of the "T" shape.

6. Check the stability of the structure after each drop.

7. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the b13 block at the left slot (y = 8) on layer 1. This will create the horizontal part of the "T" shape.

8. Check the stability of the structure after each drop.

9. The structure now resembles the uppercase character "T" and meets the stability and shape constraints.

10. If desired, repeat the process with different starting positions and orders of block drops to generate diverse structures resembling the uppercase character "T".

Note: During each drop, make sure to update the structure grid and check the stability of the structure using appropriate checks based on the block type being dropped.
