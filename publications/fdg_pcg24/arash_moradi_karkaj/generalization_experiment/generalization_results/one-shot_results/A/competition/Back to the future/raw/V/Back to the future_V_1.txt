To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "V" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` variable:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the first block, b31, at the center slot, which is slot W/2 - 1:

```
ab_drop('b31', W//2-1)
```

Step 3: Drop the second block, b13, at the left slot of the top layer:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

Step 4: Drop the third block, b13, at the right slot of the top layer:

```
ab_drop('b13', W-1)
```

Now, the structure should have a stable base and two vertical blocks at the top, forming a shape similar to the uppercase character "V". 

Step 5: Validate the stability of the structure by checking if there are any unstable blocks. If any block is found to be unstable, adjust the drop positions and recheck until the structure is stable. This can be done using a stability check function.

Step 6: Continue dropping blocks to improve the stability and adjust the overall shape. Experiment with different block types (b11, b13, and b31) at varying positions to achieve a diverse structure that resembles the uppercase character "V".

Remember to always validate the stability of the structure before dropping any block using the stability check function.
