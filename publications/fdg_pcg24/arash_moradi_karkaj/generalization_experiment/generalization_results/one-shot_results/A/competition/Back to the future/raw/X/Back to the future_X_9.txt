To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "X" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully drop the blocks one by one and ensure stability at each step. Here is a possible algorithm to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid: `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the center slot of the bottom layer (layer 0) using `ab_drop('b31', W//2)`. This creates the base of the "X" structure.

3. To create the diagonal lines of the "X", we need to vertically stack b13 blocks on top of the b31 block. Start by dropping a b13 block just above the middle slot of the b31 block. We'll call the slot at the center of the b31 block as the "pivot" slot.

4. To ensure stability, check if the structure has a stable support at the position where we want to drop the b13 block. In this case, we need to check if there is a block in the slot just below the pivot slot, and if not, drop a b11 block there using `ab_drop('b11', W//2)`. Repeat this stability check for all the slots we want to drop a block.

5. After ensuring stability, we can drop the b13 block at the desired position.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the other side of the "X", ensuring stability and dropping b13 blocks in the mirrored positions.

7. Finally, to create the intersecting line of the "X", we need to drop a b31 block just above the middle slot of the b31 block in the previous layer. Again, ensure stability before dropping the block.

8. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the blocks above the intersecting line of the "X" to complete the structure.

Here's an example implementation of the above algorithm:

```python
# Map dimensions
W = 20
H = 16

# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type, y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    
# Drop the initial b31 block at the center of the bottom layer
ab_drop('b31', W//2)

# Drop b13 blocks above the pivot slots to create the diagonal lines of the "X"
ab_drop('b11', W//2 - 1)   # Left diagonal line - top slot
ab_drop('b13', W//2)       # Left diagonal line - middle slot
ab_drop('b11', W//2 + 1)   # Left diagonal line - bottom slot

ab_drop('b11', W//2 - 1)   # Right diagonal line - top slot
ab_drop('b13', W//2)       # Right diagonal line - middle slot
ab_drop('b11', W//2 + 1)   # Right diagonal line - bottom slot

# Drop the intersecting b31 block above the middle slot of the previous b31 block
ab_drop('b31', W//2)

# Repeat the above steps for the other layers of the structure above the intersecting line

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This algorithm ensures stability by checking for existing support before dropping each block and creates a structure that resembles the uppercase character "X" by carefully positioning the blocks.
