To generate a structure resembling the capital letter "D", we can use the following series of ab_drop() function calls:

ab_drop('b11', 7)    # Place a single unit block at slot 7
ab_drop('b31', 8)    # Place a horizontal block at slot 8
ab_drop('b11', 7)    # Place another single unit block at slot 7
ab_drop('b11', 9)    # Place a single unit block at slot 9
ab_drop('b31', 8)    # Place another horizontal block at slot 8

This series of ab_drop() function calls will generate a stable structure that resembles the letter "D".
