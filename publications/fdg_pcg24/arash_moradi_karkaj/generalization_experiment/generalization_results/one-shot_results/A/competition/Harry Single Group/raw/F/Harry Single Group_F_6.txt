Based on the given information, we can use the ab_drop() function to generate the required structure resembling the letter "F". 

To form the letter "F", we need to place the bricks b13 and b31 in specific positions. Here is the step-by-step process to generate the required structure:

1. Initialize the map:
```
map = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Place the b13 brick vertically:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
This will occupy the cells (1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, 2).

3. Place the b31 brick horizontally below the b13 brick:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```
This will occupy the cells (0, 3), (1, 3), and (2, 3).

4. Ensure stability:
Check if the structure is stable by comparing the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot (1, 2). In this case, the structure is stable since both sides have one occupied cell.

Final structure:
```
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
