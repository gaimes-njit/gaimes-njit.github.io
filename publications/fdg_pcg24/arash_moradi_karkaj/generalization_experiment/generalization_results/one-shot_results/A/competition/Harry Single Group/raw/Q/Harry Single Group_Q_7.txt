To form the shape resembling the letter "Q" using the available props and the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the field:
```
field = [[0]*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Generate the upper part of the "Q" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```
This will place a b31 brick starting from x_position 6. The occupied cells will be (5, 3), (6, 3), and (7, 3).

3. Generate the lower part of the "Q" shape:
```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
The first ab_drop() will place a b13 brick starting from x_position 6. The occupied cells will be (6, 0), (6, 1), and (6, 2).
The second ab_drop() will place a b11 brick starting from x_position 5. The occupied cell will be (5, 0).

The final arrangement of occupied cells will form the shape resembling the letter "Q".
