To create the structure exactly like "B" using the ab_drop('blocktype',x position) command, we need to strategically drop blocks at specific x positions within the 20*16 box. Here is the sequence of commands to achieve the desired structure:

1. Drop a b31 block at x position 0:
   ab_drop('b31', 0)

2. Drop a b31 block at x position 0 again:
   ab_drop('b31', 0)

3. Drop a b31 block at x position 0 again:
   ab_drop('b31', 0)

4. Drop a b13 block at x position 2:
   ab_drop('b13', 2)

5. Drop a b11 block at x position 4:
   ab_drop('b11', 4)

6. Drop a b11 block at x position 5:
   ab_drop('b11', 5)

7. Drop a b11 block at x position 6:
   ab_drop('b11', 6)

8. Drop a b13 block at x position 8:
   ab_drop('b13', 8)

9. Drop a b31 block at x position 10:
   ab_drop('b31', 10)

10. Drop a b31 block at x position 10 again:
   ab_drop('b31', 10)

11. Drop a b31 block at x position 10 again:
   ab_drop('b31', 10)

This sequence of commands will create the structure exactly like the letter "B" inside the 20*16 box.
