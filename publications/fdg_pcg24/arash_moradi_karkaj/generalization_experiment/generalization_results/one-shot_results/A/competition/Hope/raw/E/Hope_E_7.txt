To create the letter "E" using the provided block types and dimensions, you can follow these steps:

1. Place a b11 block at position (0, 0) using the command: ab_drop('b11', 0)
   - This will place a 1*1 block at the top left corner of the box.

2. Place a b13 block at position (0, 1) using the command: ab_drop('b13', 1)
   - This will place a 1*3 block starting from the second row, first column.

3. Place a b11 block at position (0, 4) using the command: ab_drop('b11', 4)
   - This will place a 1*1 block starting from the fifth row, first column.

4. Place a b31 block at position (2, 0) using the command: ab_drop('b31', 0)
   - This will place a 3*1 block starting from the first row, third column.

5. Place a b31 block at position (2, 4) using the command: ab_drop('b31', 4)
   - This will place a 3*1 block starting from the fifth row, third column.

By following these steps, the blocks will form a structure exactly like the letter "E" within the 20*16 box.
