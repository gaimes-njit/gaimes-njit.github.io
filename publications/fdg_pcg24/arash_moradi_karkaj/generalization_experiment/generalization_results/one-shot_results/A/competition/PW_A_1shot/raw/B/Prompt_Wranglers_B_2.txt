To create the uppercase letter "B" using the given block types and environment, the following sequence of ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

These commands gradually stack the blocks in a specific pattern to form the desired letter "B", while maintaining structural stability and adherence to the gravity rules.
