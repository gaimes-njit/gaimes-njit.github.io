Here is a stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "G":

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

These commands will start by placing two vertical blocks (b13) at positions (1,1) and (1,3) to create the base of the letter. Then, a horizontal block (b31) is placed at position (2,2) to connect the two vertical blocks. The process is repeated for the next layer to create a complete "G" shape. Finally, two single blocks (b11) are placed at positions (1,1) and (1,2) to finish the letter.
