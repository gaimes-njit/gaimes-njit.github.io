Here is a solution for generating the uppercase English letter "M":

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This solution starts by placing two vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 2 and 3. Then, a horizontal straight block ('b31') is placed on top of these two blocks at position 1. Next, three more horizontal straight blocks are placed on top of the previous block, again at positions 1, 2, and 3. Lastly, two more vertical straight blocks are placed at positions 2 and 3 on top of the previous three horizontal blocks. This arrangement forms the letter "M" while maintaining structural stability.
