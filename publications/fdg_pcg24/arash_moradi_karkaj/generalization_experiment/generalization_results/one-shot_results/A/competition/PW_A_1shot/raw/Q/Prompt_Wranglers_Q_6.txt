To generate the uppercase English letter "Q" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 1 and 3 to form the bottom part of the "Q".
2. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2 to connect the two vertical blocks in the middle.
3. Place two more vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 1 and 3 above the previous layer to form the top part of the "Q".
4. Place a small square block ('b11') at position 2 above the previous layer to create the gap in the letter.
5. Finally, place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2 above the previous layer to complete the letter "Q".

These commands ensure structural stability and balance while accurately representing the letter "Q" within the allowed space and boundaries.
