The stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "W" is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These commands will first place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 to create the bottom foundation of the letter "W". Then, a horizontal straight block (b31) is placed at position 2 to form the middle section of the letter. Finally, two more vertical straight blocks (b13) are placed at positions 1 and 3, followed by another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to complete the letter "W".
