Here are the commands to generate the uppercase English letter "Y":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Explanation:

1. First, we start by placing two vertical blocks ('b13') at positions 1 and 3. These blocks serve as the foundation for the letter.
2. Next, we place a horizontal block ('b31') at position 2 to connect the two vertical blocks in the middle. This creates the bottom part of the letter "Y".
3. We then repeat the process of placing two vertical blocks ('b13') at positions 1 and 3 to create the middle part of the letter.
4. Lastly, we place two 1x1 square blocks ('b11') at positions 2 and 3 to complete the top part of the letter.

By following these commands, the letter "Y" will be accurately represented and fit within the allowed space boundaries in the Tetris-like environment.
