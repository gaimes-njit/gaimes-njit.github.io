To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base:
Since stability is a hard constraint, we need to start by placing the base. The base can be created by dropping a b11 block at the center of the bottom layer. We can do this using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

3. Place the vertical block:
Next, we need to place the vertical part of the "F" character. We can do this by dropping a b13 block on top of the base. Again, we can use the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Place the horizontal block:
Finally, we need to place the horizontal part of the "F" character. We can do this by dropping a b31 block slightly above the vertical block. This will create the cross-section of the "F" character. Again, we can use the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

5. Repeat Step 4 for the other horizontal blocks:
To complete the structure of the "F" character, we need to place two more horizontal blocks on top of the existing one. We can do this by dropping two more b31 blocks slightly above the existing one. Again, we can use the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

After following these steps, the structure grid will resemble the character "F" and will meet all the given constraints. You can print the structure grid to see the final result.
