To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Define the structure and initialize the grid.
```
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]  # Empty grid
```

Step 2: Determine the dropping position and order of the blocks using the ab_drop() function. We need to consider stability and no boundary intrusion constraints.

Step 3: Start by placing the base blocks (b11 or b13) to form the bottom part of the structure. These blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing. One possible configuration is to place two b13 blocks side by side on the bottom layer.

```
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place b13 block at slot 3
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place b13 block at slot 6
```

Step 4: Next, place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the base blocks to prevent overhangs. The center of the b31 block should be aligned with the center of the base blocks.

```
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Place b31 block on top of the base blocks at slot 6
```

Step 5: Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 for the top part of the structure. Place two b13 blocks side by side on the second to the top layer, and then place the horizontal block (b31) on top of them.

```
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place b13 block at slot 3 on the second to the top layer
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place b13 block at slot 6 on the second to the top layer
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Place b31 block on top of the top base blocks at slot 6
```

Step 6: Finally, generate the structure that resembles the given character by repeating Step 3 and Step 4 one more time, but this time on the third to the top layer.

```
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place b13 block at slot 3 on the third to the top layer
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place b13 block at slot 6 on the third to the top layer
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Place b31 block on top of the middle base blocks at slot 6
```

The resulting structure should resemble the character "H" and meet all the hard constraints of stability. Note that the slot numbers and dropping positions provided here are just one possible configuration. There may be other valid configurations that also satisfy the constraints.
