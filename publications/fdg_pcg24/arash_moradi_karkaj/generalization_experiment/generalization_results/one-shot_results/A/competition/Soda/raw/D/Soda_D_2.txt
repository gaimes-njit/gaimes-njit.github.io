To generate a structure that looks like a capital "D", we can start by placing a column block "b13" at the leftmost column of the grid. This will form the vertical stem of the "D". We can then place a row block "b31" centered on top of the column block to form the semi-circular part of the "D". Finally, we can place another column block "b13" centered on top of the row block to complete the structure.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top approach, ensuring stability of the blocks. It also creates a structure that resembles the letter "D".
