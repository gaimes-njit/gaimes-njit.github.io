To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "S" (TARGET), we can approach it step by step, starting from the bottom and building upwards. Here is the code implementation:

Step 1: Drop a row block (b31) at the center of the grid.
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 2: Drop a column block (b13) at the center-left of the grid.
```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```

Step 3: Drop a column block (b13) at the center-right of the grid.
```
ab_drop("b13", 14)
```

Step 4: Drop a row block (b31) above the previous row block, one cell to the left.
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Step 5: Drop a column block (b13) above the previous column block, centered.
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Step 6: Drop a column block (b13) above the previous column block, centered.
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This implementation generates a structure resembling the letter "S" and ensures stability by balancing the blocks and enforcing gravity.
