To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "C" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps using the `ab_drop()` function:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions W x H.
2. Drop a b31 block at slot 0, aligned with the bottom layer (layer 0) using `ab_drop('b31', 0)`.
3. Drop a b11 block at slot 0, aligned with the third layer (layer 2) using `ab_drop('b11', 0)`.
4. Drop a b11 block at slot 0, aligned with the fourth layer (layer 3) using `ab_drop('b11', 0)`.
5. Drop a b31 block at slot 1, aligned with the fourth layer (layer 3) using `ab_drop('b31', 1)`.
6. Drop a b13 block at slot 2, aligned with the third layer (layer 2) using `ab_drop('b13', 2)`.
7. Drop a b31 block at slot 1, aligned with the second layer (layer 1) using `ab_drop('b31', 1)`.
8. Drop a b11 block at slot 0, aligned with the second layer (layer 1) using `ab_drop('b11', 0)`.

After following these steps, the resulting structure will have a stable "C" shape and will meet all the constraints.

Note: The above steps are just an example. You can adjust the slot positions and block types to generate different variations of the "C" shape that still meet the constraints.
