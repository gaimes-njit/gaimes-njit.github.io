To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and meets all the constraints, we will use the `ab_drop()` function and drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is an approach to achieve this:

1. First, we will drop a `b13` block at position 0 using the `ab_drop('b13', 0)` function. This will form the middle vertical line of the "F".

2. Next, we will drop a `b31` block at position 1 using the `ab_drop('b31', 1)` function. This will form the horizontal line of the "F".

3. Finally, we will drop another `b31` block at position 0 using the `ab_drop('b31', 0)` function. This will form the top horizontal line of the "F".

The resulting structure will be a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and meets all the constraints.

Here is the code to achieve this:

```python
# Step 1: Drop a b13 block at position 0 to form the middle vertical line of the "F"
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Step 2: Drop a b31 block at position 1 to form the horizontal line of the "F"
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Step 3: Drop another b31 block at position 0 to form the top horizontal line of the "F"
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

By following these steps and using the `ab_drop()` function, a stable structure that looks like the character "F" will be generated.
