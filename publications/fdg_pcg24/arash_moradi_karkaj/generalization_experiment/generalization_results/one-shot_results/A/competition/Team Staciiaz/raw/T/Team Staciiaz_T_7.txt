To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "T" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in a systematic way. We need to carefully select the dropping position and order to ensure stability and prevent boundary intrusion.

Here is a step-by-step approach to generating the structure:

Step 1: Drop the base block (b31) at the center of the bottom layer to create a stable foundation.

ab_drop('b31', 9)

Step 2: Drop the vertical block (b13) on top of the base block, aligned with its center. This will create the vertical part of the "T" shape.

ab_drop('b13', 9)

Step 3: Drop the horizontal block (b31) above the vertical part, aligned with its center. This will complete the top part of the "T" shape.

ab_drop('b31', 9)

After following these steps, the structure would resemble the character "T" and meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Note: The dropping positions and orders may vary based on the specific requirements and constraints. The above steps provide a general guideline to generate the structure.
