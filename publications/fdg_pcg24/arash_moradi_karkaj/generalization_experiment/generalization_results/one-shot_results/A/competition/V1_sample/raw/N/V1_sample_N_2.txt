To create the "N" structure using the ab drop() function, start by dropping a b13 block at layer 15 with its center at slot 2.

ab drop(b13, 15, 2) 

Next, drop a b31 block at layer 14 with its center at slot 2.

ab drop(b31, 14, 2)

Then, drop another b13 block at layer 13 with its center at slot 5.

ab drop(b13, 13, 5) 

To complete the "N" structure, drop a b31 block at layer 12 with its center at slot 5.

ab drop(b31, 12, 5) 

By following these steps and dropping the blocks in the specified positions and order, you can generate a stable structure that looks like the letter "N" using the ab drop() function.
