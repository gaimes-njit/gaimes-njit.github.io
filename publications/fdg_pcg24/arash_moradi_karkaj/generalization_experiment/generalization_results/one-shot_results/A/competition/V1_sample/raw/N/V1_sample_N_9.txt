Solution:

To create the "N" shape using the 'ab drop()' function, we need to carefully position and order the blocks being dropped. Here is one way to achieve the stable structure resembling the "N" shape:

1. Drop a b31 block at slot 6 from layer 15.
2. Drop a b13 block at slot 6 from layer 15.
3. Drop a b31 block at slot 9 from layer 14.
4. Drop a b13 block at slot 12 from layer 14.
5. Drop a b31 block at slot 12 from layer 13.
6. Drop a b13 block at slot 9 from layer 13.
7. Drop a b31 block at slot 6 from layer 12.
8. Drop a b13 block at slot 6 from layer 12.

By following this dropping sequence and positioning the blocks as described, you should be able to create a stable structure resembling the "N" shape using the 'ab drop()' function.
