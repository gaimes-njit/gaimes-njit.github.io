Steps:
1. Drawing the letter "D" with asterisks:
```
*****
*    *
*    *
*    *
*****
```
2. Listing the asterisks and spaces generated in each row:
```
Row 1: *****
Row 2: *    *
Row 3: *    *
Row 4: *    *
Row 5: *****
```
3. Representing asterisks as "x" and spaces as "y":
```
Row 1: xxxxx
Row 2: xyyyy
Row 3: xyyyy
Row 4: xyyyy
Row 5: xxxxx
```
4. Writing out each "x" and "y" for each row:
```
Row 1: xxxxx
Row 2: xyyyy
Row 3: xyyyy
Row 4: xyyyy
Row 5: xxxxx
```
5. Indicating the position of each variable:
```
Row 1: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
Row 2: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; y-5
Row 3: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; y-5
Row 4: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; y-5
Row 5: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
```
6. Returning the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1) ab_drop("b11", 2) ab_drop("b11", 3) ab_drop("b11", 4) ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
