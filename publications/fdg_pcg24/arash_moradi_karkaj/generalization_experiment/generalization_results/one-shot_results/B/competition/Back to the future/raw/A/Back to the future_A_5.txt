To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A", we can follow these steps using the `ab_drop()` function:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the map initialization code provided.

2. Drop a b13 block at slot 9 (y = 9) using `ab_drop('b13', 9)` to form the top part of the "A".

3. Drop a b31 block at slot 7 (y = 7) using `ab_drop('b31', 7)` to form the middle part of the "A".

4. Drop a b31 block at slot 11 (y = 11) using `ab_drop('b31', 11)` to form the other half of the middle part of the "A".

5. Drop a b31 block at slot 5 (y = 5) using `ab_drop('b31', 5)` to form the bottom part of the "A".

By following these steps, the `ab_drop()` function will drop the blocks in a way that satisfies the stability constraint and forms a structure resembling the uppercase letter "A".
