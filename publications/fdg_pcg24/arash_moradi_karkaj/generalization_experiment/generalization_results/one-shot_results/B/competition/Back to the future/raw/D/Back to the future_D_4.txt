To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` variable.
2. Determine the drop positions for each block type to form the shape of the "D" character.
3. Call the `ab_drop()` function for each block type, ensuring stability after each drop.
4. Check for any boundary intrusion and adjust the drop positions if necessary.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the entire structure resembles the "D" character and meets all the constraints.

Here's an example implementation:

```
# Step 1: Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Determine drop positions
b13_drop_pos = (8, 4)  # Drop position for the vertical block b13
b31_drop_pos = (9, 4)  # Drop position for the horizontal block b31

# Step 3: Call ab_drop() for each block type
ab_drop('b13', b13_drop_pos[1])
ab_drop('b31', b31_drop_pos[1])

# Step 4: Check for boundary intrusion
if b31_drop_pos[1] < 1:
    b31_drop_pos = (b31_drop_pos[0], 1)
elif b31_drop_pos[1] > 17:
    b31_drop_pos = (b31_drop_pos[0], 17)

# Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the structure is complete
```

Please note that this is just a partial implementation and additional steps may be required to complete the structure and meet all the constraints.
