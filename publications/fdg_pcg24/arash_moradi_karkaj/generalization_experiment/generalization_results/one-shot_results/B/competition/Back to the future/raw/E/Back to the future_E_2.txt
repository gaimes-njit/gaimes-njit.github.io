To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "E" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the base block (b31) to provide a stable foundation:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
Coordinates: (15, 9)

3. Drop the vertical block (b13) to form the central vertical line of the "E":
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
Coordinates: (14, 9)

4. Drop the horizontal block (b31) to form the top bar of the "E":
```
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```
Coordinates: (13, 7)

5. Drop the horizontal block (b31) to form the middle bar of the "E":
```
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```
Coordinates: (11, 7)

6. Drop the horizontal block (b31) to form the bottom bar of the "E":
```
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```
Coordinates: (9, 7)

7. Drop the vertical block (b13) next to the central vertical line of the "E" to complete the structure:
```
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```
Coordinates: (14, 11)

8. The final structure should resemble the uppercase character "E" and meet all the hard constraints.

Note: The specific slot numbers (y-coordinate) may vary depending on the starting position. The above steps provide a general guideline to generate a stable structure resembling the uppercase character "E".
