To use the `ab_drop()` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "I" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions W x H using the following code:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the drop positions for each block type (b11, b31, and b13) based on the block-stacking problem. Ensure that the structure is stable and can support the weight of the blocks before each drop.

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks at the determined positions. Update the structure grid after each drop.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire structure resembles the uppercase letter "I" and satisfies all the hard constraints.

Here is a sample code that uses the `ab_drop()` function to generate the structure:

```python
W = 20  # width of the map
H = 16  # height of the map

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # implementation of the ab_drop() function
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    return drop_pos

# Step 1: Place the base block (b31) at the bottom layer and centered on the map
base_pos = ab_drop('b31', W//2)

# Step 2: Place the middle part of the "I" (b13) above the base block
middle_pos = ab_drop('b13', base_pos[1])

# Step 3: Place the top part of the "I" (b11) above the middle part
top_pos = ab_drop('b11', middle_pos[1])

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Note: This is just a simplified example to demonstrate how to use the `ab_drop()` function. In practice, you would need to come up with a more complex algorithm or optimization technique to ensure that the structure meets all the constraints and resembles the uppercase "I".
