To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "N" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block (b13) in the bottom layer (layer 0) at slot 5 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
This will place the block in the center of the structure's bottom layer.

3. Drop the second block (b11) above the first block at slot 5 in layer 1:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

4. Drop the third block (b31) above the second block at slot 4 in layer 2:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

5. Drop the fourth block (b11) above the third block at slot 4 in layer 3:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

6. Drop the fifth block (b13) above the fourth block at slot 5 in layer 4:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

7. Repeat steps 3-6 to build the upper part of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

8. Finally, visualize the generated structure:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```
This will print the structure as a grid of characters.

The resulting structure will resemble the uppercase letter "N" and meet all the hard constraints.
