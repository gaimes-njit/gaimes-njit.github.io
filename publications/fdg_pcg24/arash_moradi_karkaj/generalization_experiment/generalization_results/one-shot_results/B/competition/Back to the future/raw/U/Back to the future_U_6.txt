To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "U", we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the center slot of the base layer (layer 0) to provide a stable support for the U shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
Coordinates: (15, 9)

3. Drop a b13 block on top of the b31 block to form the left vertical line of the U shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
Coordinates: (12, 9)

4. Drop a b13 block on top of the left vertical line, but this time at the rightmost slot, to form the right vertical line of the U shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```
Coordinates: (9, 10)

5. Drop a b31 block on top of the left and right vertical lines to bridge them and complete the U shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
Coordinates: (6, 9)

6. Now, we have the basic structure of the U shape. To make it more stable and meet the stability constraint, we will reinforce the blocks by dropping additional blocks below them.

7. Drop a b11 block at the center slot below the bottom of the U shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
Coordinates: (14, 9)

8. Drop a b11 block at the center slot below the left vertical line of the U shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
Coordinates: (11, 9)

9. Drop a b11 block at the center slot below the right vertical line of the U shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
Coordinates: (8, 10)

10. Drop a b11 block at the center slot below the bridge between the left and right vertical lines of the U shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
Coordinates: (5, 9)

Now, we have generated a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "U" while meeting the hard constraints. The exact coordinates of each block placement are provided in the comments above.
