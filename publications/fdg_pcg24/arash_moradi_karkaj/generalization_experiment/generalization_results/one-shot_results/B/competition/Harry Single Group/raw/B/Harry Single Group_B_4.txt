To generate the shape resembling the letter "B", we will use the available props and the ab_drop() function. 

First, we initialize the field by creating a 20x16 grid filled with zeros. We will represent empty cells with 0 and occupied cells with 1.

```
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, we start placing the bricks on the field using the ab_drop() function. We will follow a step-by-step approach to ensure stability and avoid boundary collisions.

Step 1: Place the left vertical part of the "B" shape.
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the first vertical brick on x_position = 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the second vertical brick on x_position = 1
```
After this step, the cells (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 2) will be occupied.

Step 2: Place the horizontal part of the "B" shape.
```
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the horizontal brick starting at x_position = 3
```
After this step, the cells (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), and (7, 3) will be occupied.

Step 3: Adjust the position of the horizontal part.
```
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place a square brick at the bottom-left corner of the horizontal part
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Place a square brick at the bottom-right corner of the horizontal part
```
After this step, the cells (2, 0), (8, 0) will be occupied.

The final structure resembling the letter "B" will occupy the following cells:
```
(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (2, 0), (8, 0)
```

Please note that this is just one way to generate the "B" shape using the given props and function. There may be alternative solutions.

Make sure to execute the code within the specified format and observe the important notes to ensure stability and boundary avoidance.
