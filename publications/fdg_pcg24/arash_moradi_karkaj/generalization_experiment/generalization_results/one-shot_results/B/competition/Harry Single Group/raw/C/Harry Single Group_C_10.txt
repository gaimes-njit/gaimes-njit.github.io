First, let's initialize the map with all cells set to 0 (unoccupied):

```python
map = []
for i in range(16):
    map.append([0] * 20)
```

Next, we can start generating the structure. We will use the `ab_drop()` function to place each brick on the field. We need to carefully consider the stability and boundary collision rules.

To form the letter "C", we will need 5 bricks: b13, b31, b31, b13, and b11. Here's the code to generate the structure:

```python
# Place b13 brick
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Place b31 brick
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Place b31 brick
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Place b13 brick
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Place b11 brick
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

Now, let's modify the `ab_drop()` function to make sure the bricks are placed in a stable manner and don't collide with the boundaries:

```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Get the brick shape and dimensions based on x
    if x == 'b31':
        shape = 'b31'
        width = 3
        height = 1
    elif x == 'b13':
        shape = 'b13'
        width = 1
        height = 3
    elif x == 'b11':
        shape = 'b11'
        width = 1
        height = 1
    else:
        return

    # Check if the brick will collide with the boundaries
    if y+width > 19 or y < 0:
        return

    # Check if the brick will collide with other occupied cells or cause instability
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if map[i][y+j] == 1:
                return
            if i > 0 and map[i-1][y+j] == 0:
                return

    # Place the brick on the map
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            map[i][y+j] = 1
```

Finally, we can print the resulting structure:

```python
for row in map:
    for cell in row:
        if cell == 1:
            print('█', end='')
        else:
            print(' ', end='')
    print()
```

This will print the structure resembling the letter "C" using the ASCII character '█' for occupied cells.
