To generate the required structure resembling the letter "C", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() functions:

```
ab_drop('b13', 13)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```

This sequence starts by placing a vertical b13 brick on the ground at x_position 13. This forms the left side of the "C" shape. It is important to note that the b13 brick is stable as it has an equal number of occupied cells on its left and right sides.

Next, we place a horizontal b31 brick on the ground at x_position 4. This forms the horizontal segment of the "C" shape.

Then, another horizontal b31 brick is placed on the ground at x_position 12. This completes the top segment of the "C" shape.

Finally, a vertical b13 brick is placed above the previous b31 brick at x_position 14. This forms the right side of the "C" shape. Again, it is important to note that the b13 brick is stable.

By following this sequence, we ensure that the bricks are stable and there are no boundary collisions. The resulting structure will resemble the letter "C" on the specified field.
