To generate the letter "P" using the given props and functions, we need to strategically place the bricks and ensure stability and boundary collisions are avoided. Here is the code to generate the required structure:

```
# Map Initialization
map = [[0] * 20 for i in range(16)]

# Function to check if a cell is occupied
def isOccupied(x, y):
    if x < 0 or x >= 20 or y < 0 or y >= 16:
        return True
    return map[y][x] == 1

# Function to place a brick
def placeBrick(x, y, width, height):
    for i in range(y, y + height):
        for j in range(x, x + width):
            map[i][j] = 1

# Function to check stability of the structure
def checkStability():
    for i in range(15, 0, -1):
        for j in range(1, 19):
            if map[i][j] == 1:
                leftOccupied = isOccupied(j-1, i)
                rightOccupied = isOccupied(j+1, i)
                upperLeftOccupied = isOccupied(j-1, i+1)
                upperRightOccupied = isOccupied(j+1, i+1)
                
                if (leftOccupied and not upperLeftOccupied) or (rightOccupied and not upperRightOccupied):
                    return False
    return True

# Function to drop a brick
def ab_drop(x, y):
    if x == 'b31':
        placeBrick(y-1, 0, 3, 1)
        for i in range(1, 16):
            if isOccupied(y-1, i):
                return
            else:
                placeBrick(y-1, i, 3, 1)
    elif x == 'b13':
        placeBrick(y, 0, 1, 3)
        for i in range(1, 16):
            if isOccupied(y, i):
                return
            else:
                placeBrick(y, i, 1, 3)
    elif x == 'b11':
        placeBrick(y, 0, 1, 1)
        for i in range(1, 16):
            if isOccupied(y, i):
                return
            else:
                placeBrick(y, i, 1, 1)

# Generate the required structure
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Check stability and avoid boundary collisions
if checkStability():
    for row in map:
        print(row)
else:
    print("The structure is unstable. Please modify the placement of bricks.")
```

This code will generate the letter "P" on the field while ensuring stability and avoiding boundary collisions. You can modify the code to generate different shapes or add additional functionality as required.
