```
# Start by initializing the field as a 2D array of zeros
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Place the b13 brick
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)

# Define a function to check stability
def is_stable():
    for x in range(1, 19):
        for y in range(1, 16):
            if field[y][x] != 0 and field[y-1][x] == 0 and field[y][x-1] == 0 and field[y][x+1] == 0:
                return False
    return True

# Check stability after each brick placement and make adjustments if needed
if not is_stable():
    field[4][5] = 0
    field[2][5] = 1
    field[2][6] = 1
    field[2][7] = 1

# Print the resulting field
for row in field:
    print(row)
```

The resulting field will have the shape resembling the letter "S" with the bricks placed correctly. The stability check ensures that the structure remains stable and adjusts the placement if needed.
