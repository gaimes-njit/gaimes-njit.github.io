To create the letter "I" inside the 20*16 box, we can use the following ab_drop commands:

1. Place the first vertical block:
ab_drop('b13', 9)

2. Place the horizontal block:
ab_drop('b31', 8)

3. Place the second vertical block:
ab_drop('b13', 9)

The resulting structure will look like the letter "I" inside the 20*16 box. The coordinates are based on a 0-based index, where the top-left corner is (0, 0).
