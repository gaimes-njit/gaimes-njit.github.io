To create the letter "M" inside a 20x16 box using the ab_drop() command, we would need to drop the blocks in a specific sequence. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. Drop a b13 block at position (2, 8):

ab_drop('b13', 2)

2. Drop a b11 block at position (3, 7):

ab_drop('b11', 3)

3. Drop a b11 block at position (4, 8):

ab_drop('b11', 4)

4. Drop a b13 block at position (5, 8):

ab_drop('b13', 5)

5. Drop a b31 block at position (7, 8):

ab_drop('b31', 7)

6. Drop a b31 block at position (11, 8):

ab_drop('b31', 11)

7. Drop a b13 block at position (13, 8):

ab_drop('b13', 13)

8. Drop a b11 block at position (14, 7):

ab_drop('b11', 14)

9. Drop a b11 block at position (15, 8):

ab_drop('b11', 15)

By following these steps, you should be able to construct the letter "M" inside the 20x16 box using the ab_drop() command.
