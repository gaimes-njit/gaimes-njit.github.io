Use `ab_drop()` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the <OBJECT>â€”the goal. Dropping position and order are crucial.

1. Definitions
Slots: The map's width is equally partitioned into W slots where W = 20, with slots 0 and 19 being the most left and right, respectively.
Layers: The map's height is equally partitioned into H layers where H = 16, with layers 0 and 15 being the bottom and top layers, respectively.
Base: The bottom of the map, i.e., layer 0.

2. Environment
There are three block types as follows:
b11, a square block whose width is 1 unit and height is 1 unit
b31, a horizontal block whose width is 3 units and height is 1 unit
b13, a vertical block whose width is 1 unit and height is 3 units

3. Tool
Use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop a block from layer H such that its center is at slot y and drop earlier blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure.


The definition of the ab_drop() function is as follows:
    It drops a block vertically drop a block from the top and center it at a specific slot, denoted by x_position.
    This function works on the following settings:
        A structure is situated on a 2D grid with a width (W) of 20 columns and a height (H) of 16 rows. The grid consists of 320 cells, each of equal size.
        Coordinates (x, y) are used to represent the positions in the grid, where x and y show the horizontal and vertical indices of cells, respectively. For example, (0, 0) denotes the bottom-left corner cell of the grid, and (W-1, H-1) is the top-right corner cell.
        A cell on the grid has a size of 1x1. Each cell has unique (x, y) coordinates associated with it.
    This function accepts two parameters:
        block_type: a value that indicates the type of block to be placed. The possible values areb11, b13, and b31. An invalid block type will result in an error.
            b11 denotes a square block whose size is 1x1.
            b11 blocks
            b13 denotes a column block whose size is 1x3.
            b13 blocks
            b31 denotes a row block whose size is 3x1.
            b31 blocks
        x_position: a horizontal index of a grid cell, where 0 represents the leftmost column of the grid, and W-1 represents the rightmost column of the grid. The x_position parameter indicates the center pivot point of the block being placed. For example, if b31 is the only block in the level and is placed at x_position=4, it will occupy cells (3, 0), (4, 0), and (5, 0). An invalid position, like a position where a block of interest intrudes on the grid boundary, will result in an error.
