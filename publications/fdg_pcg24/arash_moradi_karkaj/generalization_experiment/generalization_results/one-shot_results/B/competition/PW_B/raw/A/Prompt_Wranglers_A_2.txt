To generate the uppercase English letter "A", the following steps can be followed:

1. Start by building the base of the letter "A" using horizontal blocks. Place two horizontal blocks next to each other at the bottom row:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Build the first vertical line of the letter "A". Place a vertical block on the left side of the base:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Build the second vertical line of the letter "A". Place a vertical block on the right side of the base:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

4. Build the horizontal bar of the letter "A". Place three horizontal blocks at the middle row, starting from the left side:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

5. Build the top of the letter "A". Place two horizontal blocks at the top row, next to each other:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

By following these steps, the letter "A" can be generated using the specified block types and Tetris-like environment.
