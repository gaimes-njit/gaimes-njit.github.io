To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we can follow the instructions below:

1. Start from the bottom to build a stable foundation:
```py
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
2. Move to the next structural layer and place two vertical blocks:
```py
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
3. Place another middle layer on top of the previous two:
```py
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
4. Place two vertical blocks as before on top of the current structure:
```py
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
5. Finally, place the top of the letter "A":
```py
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Your stream of commands to generate the letter "A" should look like this:
```py
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
