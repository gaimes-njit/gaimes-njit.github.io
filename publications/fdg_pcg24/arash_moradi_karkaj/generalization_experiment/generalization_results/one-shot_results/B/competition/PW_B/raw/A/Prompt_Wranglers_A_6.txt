To generate the uppercase English letter "A" using the mentioned command and Block Types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start from the bottom by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```ab_drop('b31', 1)```

2. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on top of the previous block, at positions 0 and 2 to create the legs of the letter:
```ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)```

3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the legs, at position 1:
```ab_drop('b31', 1)```

4. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on top of the previous block, at positions 0 and 2 to create the middle section of the letter:
```ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)```

5. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the middle section, at position 1 to complete the letter "A":
