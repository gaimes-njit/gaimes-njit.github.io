To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start from the bottom by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Move to the next structural layer and place a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 0 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 on top of the previous layer:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 0 and 2 on top of the current structure:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

5. Finally, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 as the top of the letter "A":
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "A" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
