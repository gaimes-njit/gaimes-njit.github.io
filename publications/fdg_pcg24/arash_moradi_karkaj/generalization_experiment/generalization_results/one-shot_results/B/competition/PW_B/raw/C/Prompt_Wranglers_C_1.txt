To generate capital case letter "C", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block at the bottom:
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

2. Place a vertical straight block next to the previous block to form the left side of the letter:
   ab_drop('b13', 0)

3. Place another vertical straight block next to the previous block to form the right side of the letter:
   ab_drop('b13', 2)

4. Place a horizontal straight block on top of the previous blocks to form the top part of the letter:
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

Here is the complete stream of commands to generate the letter "C":
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
