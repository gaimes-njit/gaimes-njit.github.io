To generate the uppercase letter "C", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block at the bottom with a width of 3 units:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Move to the next structural layer and place a vertical straight block at the leftmost position:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block at the rightmost position:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Move to the next structural layer and place a horizontal straight block at the middle position:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. Move to the next structural layer and place a vertical straight block at the leftmost position:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

6. Place another vertical straight block at the rightmost position:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

7. Finally, place a horizontal straight block at the top position:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

By following these steps, you will be able to generate the uppercase letter "C" using the provided block types and within the defined environment.
