To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 0:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous blocks at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. Place a vertical straight block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 0:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

6. Place another vertical straight block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

7. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous blocks at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "C" in the defined environment while maintaining structural stability.
