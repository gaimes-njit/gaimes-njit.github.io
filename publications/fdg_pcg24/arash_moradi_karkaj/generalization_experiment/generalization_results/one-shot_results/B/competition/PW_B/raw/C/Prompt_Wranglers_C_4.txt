To generate the uppercase letter "C" using the given block types and instructions, follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical blocks next to each other at the bottom of the grid:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block on top of the vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Place two more vertical blocks on top of the horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Place another horizontal straight block on top of the vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

5. Place two more vertical blocks on top of the horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

The final arrangement of blocks should resemble the uppercase letter "C".
