To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0 and 2 above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
