To create the uppercase letter "C" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by building the bottom curve of the letter "C" using two vertical blocks:
   - ab_drop('b13', 0)
   - ab_drop('b13', 2)

2. Place a horizontal block on top of the previously placed vertical blocks to form the middle part of the letter "C":
   - ab_drop('b31', 1)

3. Build the top curve of the letter "C" using two more vertical blocks:
   - ab_drop('b13', 0)
   - ab_drop('b13', 2)

Here is the complete stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "C":

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
