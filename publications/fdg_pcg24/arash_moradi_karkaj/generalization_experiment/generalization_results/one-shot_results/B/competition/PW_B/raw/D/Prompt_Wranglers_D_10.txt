To generate the uppercase English letter "D" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the vertical stem of the letter "D" using two vertical blocks (b13) placed side by side at positions 1 and 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Next, create the horizontal crossbar of the letter "D" using a horizontal block (b31) placed at position 1 along the width, overlapping the top of the stem:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Finally, reinforce the stability of the letter "D" by placing two vertical blocks (b13) on top of the crossbar, at positions 1 and 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

By following these steps, we can generate the uppercase English letter "D" using the provided block types and the given command ab_drop(x, y) in the defined environment.
