To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by building the left vertical line of the letter:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

2. Next, place the top crossbar of the letter:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

3. To complete the letter, we need to add a bottom horizontal line for stability:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

By following these steps, we can generate the uppercase letter "D" using the `ab_drop()` command and the provided block types in the given environment.
