To generate the uppercase letter "D", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 as the base:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0 and position 2 to create the two vertical lines of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 above the base block to create the top line of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. The final letter "D" shape should now be formed.

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "D" is as follows:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
