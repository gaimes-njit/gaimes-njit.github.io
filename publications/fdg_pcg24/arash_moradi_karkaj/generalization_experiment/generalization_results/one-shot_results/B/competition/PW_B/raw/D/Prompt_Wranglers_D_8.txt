To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we can follow the same approach as the letter "B" but with slight modifications. Here is a step-by-step guide to constructing the letter "D":

1. Start by building the foundation of the letter "D" by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at the bottom:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

2. Move to the next structural layer and place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on both sides of the horizontal block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. Continue by adding another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous layer:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

4. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on both sides of the new horizontal block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

5. Finally, complete the letter "D" by adding a small horizontal straight block (b11) on top of the structure:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 1)
   ```

After following these steps, you should have successfully generated the uppercase English letter "D" in the Tetris-like environment.
