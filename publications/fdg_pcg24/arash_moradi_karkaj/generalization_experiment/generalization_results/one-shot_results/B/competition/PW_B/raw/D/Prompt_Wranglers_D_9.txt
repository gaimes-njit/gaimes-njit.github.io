To create the uppercase letter "D" using the given block types (b11, b31, and b13), follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at the bottom of the grid, starting at position 1:
```
ab_drop(b31, 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at the leftmost position of the grid, one unit above the previous block:
```
ab_drop(b13, 0)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at the rightmost position of the grid, one unit above the previous block:
```
ab_drop(b13, 2)
```

4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) one unit above the previous blocks, starting at position 1:
```
ab_drop(b31, 1)
```

5. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at the leftmost position of the grid, one unit above the previous block:
```
ab_drop(b13, 0)
```

6. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at the rightmost position of the grid, one unit above the previous block:
```
ab_drop(b13, 2)
```

7. The letter "D" is now complete.

Note: Ensure that the structural stability is maintained at each step by considering the number of blocks stacked on top of each other and avoiding exceeding the height boundary.
