To construct the uppercase letter "E", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing a horizontal block ('b31') at position 1 to create the base of the letter.
2. Place two vertical blocks ('b13') at positions 0 and 2 to create the left and right vertical lines of the letter.
3. Place two more vertical blocks ('b13') at positions 0 and 2 to extend the height of the left and right lines.
4. Place another horizontal block ('b31') at position 1 to create the middle horizontal line of the letter.
5. Place three horizontal blocks ('b31') at positions 0, 1, and 2 to extend the width of the middle line.
6. Place two vertical blocks ('b13') at positions 0 and 2 to connect the left and right lines with the middle line.
7. Place two more vertical blocks ('b13') at positions 0 and 2 to complete the top part of the letter.

By following these commands, the uppercase letter "E" can be constructed in the given Tetris-like environment while maintaining stability and fitting within the allowed space boundaries.
