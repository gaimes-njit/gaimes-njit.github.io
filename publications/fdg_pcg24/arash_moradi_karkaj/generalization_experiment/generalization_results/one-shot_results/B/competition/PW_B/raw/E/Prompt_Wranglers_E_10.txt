To generate the uppercase English letter "E", we need to follow the stacking and stability rules while placing the blocks. Here is the stream of commands to construct the letter "E":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Bottom horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Left vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Right vertical block
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Middle horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Left vertical block (above middle horizontal block)
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Right vertical block (above middle horizontal block)
```

This series of commands will stack the blocks in a way that forms the capital letter "E" within the allowed space boundaries and maintains structural stability.
