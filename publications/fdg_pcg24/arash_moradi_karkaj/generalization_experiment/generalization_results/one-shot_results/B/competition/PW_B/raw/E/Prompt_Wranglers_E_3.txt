To generate the uppercase letter "E", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 1 and 3, right next to the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at positions 1 and 3, right above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

5. Finally, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This completes the construction of the letter "E".
