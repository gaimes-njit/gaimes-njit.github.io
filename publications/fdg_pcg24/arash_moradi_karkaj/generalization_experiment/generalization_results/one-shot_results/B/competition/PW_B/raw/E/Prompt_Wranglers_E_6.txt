To generate the uppercase letter "E", we need to follow the same process as described for the letter "B" in the previous example. 

Here are the steps to create the letter "E":

1. Start by building the bottom horizontal line of the letter using a horizontal straight block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

2. Move to the next structural layer and place two vertical blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. Place another horizontal straight block on top of the previous layer:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

4. Move to the next structural layer and place two vertical blocks again:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

5. Finally, place the top horizontal line of the letter using a horizontal straight block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

After executing these commands consecutively, you will have successfully generated the uppercase letter "E" in the Tetris-like environment.
