To generate the uppercase English letter "E", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by building the left vertical line of the letter:
   - Place two vertical blocks on the left side:
     ```
     ab_drop('b13', 0)
     ab_drop('b13', 0)
     ```

2. Move to the next structural layer and place a horizontal block on top of the left vertical line:
   - Place a horizontal block at position 1:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', 1)
     ```

3. Build the middle horizontal line of the letter:
   - Place a horizontal block on top of the previous one:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', 1)
     ```

4. Move to the next structural layer and place a horizontal block on top of the middle horizontal line:
   - Place a horizontal block at position 1:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', 1)
     ```

5. Build the right vertical line of the letter:
   - Place two vertical blocks on the right side:
     ```
     ab_drop('b13', 2)
     ab_drop('b13', 2)
     ```

6. Move to the next structural layer and place a horizontal block on top of the right vertical line:
   - Place a horizontal block at position 1:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', 1)
     ```

7. Build the bottom horizontal line of the letter:
   - Place a horizontal block on top of the previous one:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', 1)
     ```

8. Move to the next structural layer and place a horizontal block on top of the bottom horizontal line:
   - Place a horizontal block at position 1:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', 1)
     ```

The final sequence of ab_drop() commands for generating the uppercase English letter "E" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
