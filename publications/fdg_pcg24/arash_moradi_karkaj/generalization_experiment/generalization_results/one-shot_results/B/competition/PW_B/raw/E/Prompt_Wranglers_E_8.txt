To generate the uppercase English letter "E", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 0 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, just above the previous one:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 0 and 2, just above the previous ones:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

5. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, just above the previous ones:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "E" in the Tetris-like environment. The blocks are stacked in a stable manner, following the rules of gravity and fitting within the allowed space boundaries.
