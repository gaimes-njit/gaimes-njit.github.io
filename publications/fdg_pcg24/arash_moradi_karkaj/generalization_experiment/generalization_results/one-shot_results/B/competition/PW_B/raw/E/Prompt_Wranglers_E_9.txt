To generate the uppercase English letter "E", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block on the bottom row at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block on the next row at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block on the same row at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

4. Place another horizontal straight block on the next row at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. Place a vertical straight block on the same row at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

6. Place another vertical straight block on the same row at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

7. Place a horizontal straight block on the next row at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

By following these steps, you can generate the uppercase English letter "E" while maintaining structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
