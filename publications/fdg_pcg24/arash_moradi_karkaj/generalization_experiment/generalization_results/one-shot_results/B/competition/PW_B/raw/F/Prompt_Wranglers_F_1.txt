From the instructions, we need to generate the uppercase English letter "F" using the ab_drop(x, y) command and the given block types in the defined environment. We will follow the mentioned process to construct the letter "F" while maintaining structural stability and balance.

To construct the letter "F", we can use two horizontal blocks (b31) and one vertical block (b13).

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "F":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place the first horizontal block at position 1

ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place the second horizontal block below the first one at position 1

ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place the vertical block to the right of the first horizontal block at position 2

ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place another vertical block below the first one at position 2
```

The above commands will construct the letter "F" in the Tetris-like environment, ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
