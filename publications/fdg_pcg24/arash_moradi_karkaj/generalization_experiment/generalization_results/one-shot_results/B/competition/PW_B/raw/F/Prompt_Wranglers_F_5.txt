To generate the uppercase letter "F", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0, on top of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Then, place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, on top of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, on top of the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The above steps will create the uppercase letter "F" using the specified block types and maintaining structural stability and balance within the allowed space.
