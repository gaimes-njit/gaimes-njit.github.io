To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0 and another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 on top of the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0 and another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 on top of the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

That's it! Following these steps will generate the letter "F" using the given block types and maintaining structural stability.
