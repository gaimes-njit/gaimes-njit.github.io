To generate the uppercase English letter "F" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the vertical part of the letter "F" using two vertical blocks (b13) placed on the left and right sides of the grid:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Create the horizontal part of the letter "F" using a horizontal block (b31) placed on top of the vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Create the topmost part of the letter "F" using a horizontal block (b31) placed on top of the previous horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final set of commands to generate the letter "F" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
