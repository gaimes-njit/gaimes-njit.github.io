To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal block (b31) at position 1.
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place two vertical blocks (b13) at positions -1 and 0, respectively.
```
ab_drop('b13', -1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Place another horizontal block (b31) at position 1 to create the middle section.
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Place two vertical blocks (b13) at positions -1 and 0 on top of the middle section.
```
ab_drop('b13', -1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

5. Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 1 to complete the letter "G".
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
