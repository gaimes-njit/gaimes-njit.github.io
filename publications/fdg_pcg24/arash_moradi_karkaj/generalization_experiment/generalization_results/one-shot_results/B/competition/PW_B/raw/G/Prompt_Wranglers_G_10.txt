To generate the uppercase letter "G", we need to follow the given instructions and use the block types mentioned (b11, b31, b13) in the defined environment. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "G":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Create the horizontal base of the letter "G"
ab_drop('b13', 0)    # Build the vertical component on the left side
ab_drop('b31', 0)    # Add the top-left horizontal part of the letter "G"
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Build the vertical component on the right side
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable and balanced representation of the uppercase letter "G" within the allowed space boundaries.
