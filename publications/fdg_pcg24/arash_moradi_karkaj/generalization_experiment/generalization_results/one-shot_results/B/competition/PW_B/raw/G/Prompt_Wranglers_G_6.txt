To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by constructing the bottom part of the letter by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Next, add a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 0 and 2 to create the two vertical stems of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. To create the middle part of the letter, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Add two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 0 and 2 on top of the middle block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

5. Finally, complete the letter by placing another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The full stream of commands to generate the letter "G" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
