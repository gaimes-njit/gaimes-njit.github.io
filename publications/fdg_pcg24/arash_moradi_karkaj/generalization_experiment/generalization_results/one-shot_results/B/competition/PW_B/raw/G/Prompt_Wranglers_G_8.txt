To generate the uppercase English letter "G" using the mentioned block types and command, we can follow the steps below:

1. Start by creating the base foundation of the letter "G" using two vertical blocks stacked on top of each other:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Next, add a horizontal straight block on top of the vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Now, place a vertical block on the right side of the horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. To complete the shape of the letter "G", add a horizontal straight block on top of the previous vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final stream of commands will look like this:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
