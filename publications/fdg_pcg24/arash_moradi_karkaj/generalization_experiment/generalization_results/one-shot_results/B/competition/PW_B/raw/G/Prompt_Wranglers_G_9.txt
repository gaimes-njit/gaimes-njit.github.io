To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by building the bottom of the letter using a horizontal straight block (b31):
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

2. Move to the next structural layer and place two vertical straight blocks (b13) to form the sides of the letter:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous layer to connect the sides:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

4. Add another pair of vertical straight blocks (b13) on top of the current structure:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

5. Finally, complete the letter "G" by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) on top:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```
