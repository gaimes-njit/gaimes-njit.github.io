To construct the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at the bottom of the grid to form the base of the letter:
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

2. Move up one row and place a vertical straight block (b13) on the left side of the grid:
   ab_drop('b13', 1)

3. Move up one row and place a vertical straight block (b13) on the left side of the grid, next to the previously placed block:
   ab_drop('b13', 1)

4. Move up one row and place a horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle of the grid, between the two vertical blocks:
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

5. Move up one row and place a vertical straight block (b13) on the left side of the grid, next to the previously placed block:
   ab_drop('b13', 1)

6. Move up one row and place a vertical straight block (b13) on the left side of the grid, next to the previously placed block:
   ab_drop('b13', 1)

7. Move up one row and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at the top of the grid, forming the top portion of the letter:
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

By following these steps, the uppercase letter "H" will be constructed in the Tetris-like environment.
