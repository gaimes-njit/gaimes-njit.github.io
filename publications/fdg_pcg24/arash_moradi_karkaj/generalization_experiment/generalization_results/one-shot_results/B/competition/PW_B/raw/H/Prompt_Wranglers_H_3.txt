To generate the uppercase English letter "H", we will follow the same process as mentioned above in the example for the letter "B". Here are the commands to generate the letter "H":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

These commands will create a stable and balanced representation of the letter "H" using the block types available.
