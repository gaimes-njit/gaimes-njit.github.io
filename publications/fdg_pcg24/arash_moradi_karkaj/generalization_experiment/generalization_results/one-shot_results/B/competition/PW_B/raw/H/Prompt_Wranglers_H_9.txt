To generate the uppercase English letter "H", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, one unit above the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 4, one unit to the right of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 5, one unit to the right of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

5. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 6, one unit to the right of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

6. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 8, one unit to the right of the previous block:

7. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 9, one unit to the right of the previous block:
