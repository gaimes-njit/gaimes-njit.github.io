To generate the uppercase English letter "I", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block at the bottom of the grid:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

2. Place a vertical straight block above the horizontal block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. Place another vertical straight block above the previous block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

4. Place one more vertical straight block above the previous block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

5. Place a horizontal straight block above the top of the vertical blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

After following these steps, the grid will resemble the uppercase English letter "I".
