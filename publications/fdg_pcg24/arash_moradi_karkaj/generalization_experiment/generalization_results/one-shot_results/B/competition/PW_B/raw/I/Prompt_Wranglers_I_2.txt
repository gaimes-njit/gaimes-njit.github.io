To generate the uppercase English letter "I", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical block (b13) at position 0 and another vertical block (b13) at position 2 to create the vertical part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place another horizontal block (b31) at position 1 on top of the vertical blocks to complete the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final sequence of commands to generate the letter "I" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
