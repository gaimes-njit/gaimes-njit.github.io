To generate the uppercase English letter "I" using the given block types and the defined environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical block (b13) at position 1:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

2. Place another vertical block (b13) at position 1, on top of the previous block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

3. Place one more vertical block (b13) at position 1, on top of the previous two blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

4. Finally, place a horizontal block (b31) at position 1, on top of the previous three blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

This completes the construction of the uppercase letter "I" using the given block types and the defined environment.
