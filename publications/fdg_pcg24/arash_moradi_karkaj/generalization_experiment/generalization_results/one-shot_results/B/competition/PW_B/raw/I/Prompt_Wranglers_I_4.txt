To generate the uppercase English letter "I", we can follow the below steps:

1. Start from the bottom and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, above the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, above the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

6. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

7. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The above commands will generate the uppercase letter "I" with the given block types and within the defined environment.
