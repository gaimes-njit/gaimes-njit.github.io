To generate the uppercase letter "I" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0 and position 2 on top of the previous block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 on top of the previously placed blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0 and position 2 on top of the previous block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

5. Place the final horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 on top of the existing blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "I" in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
