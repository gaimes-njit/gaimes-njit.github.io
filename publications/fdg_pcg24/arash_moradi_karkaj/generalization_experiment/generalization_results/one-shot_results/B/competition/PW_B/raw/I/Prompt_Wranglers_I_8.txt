To generate the uppercase English letter "I" using the given block types and environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal block (b31) at position 1 to form the base of the "I":
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical block (b13) at position 0 above the base to create the vertical line of the "I":
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Place another vertical block (b13) at position 2 above the base to complete the vertical line of the "I":
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Lastly, place another horizontal block (b31) at position 1 above the vertical line to complete the "I":
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the uppercase letter "I" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
