To generate the uppercase English letter "J" using the mentioned block types and commands, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by building the base of the letter. Place two vertical blocks (b13) next to each other. 
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place a horizontal block (b31) on top of the base, centered between the two vertical blocks. 
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Place another horizontal block (b31) on top of the previous one, overlapping half of it. 
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

4. Finally, place a vertical block (b13) on top of the second horizontal block, centered between the two vertical blocks. 
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

By following these steps, you should be able to construct the uppercase English letter "J" within the defined environment while maintaining structural stability.
