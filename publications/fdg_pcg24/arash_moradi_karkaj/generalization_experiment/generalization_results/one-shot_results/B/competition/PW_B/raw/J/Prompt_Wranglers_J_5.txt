To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we can follow these steps:

1. Start from the bottom by placing a horizontal block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical block at position 1 above the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another vertical block at position 1 above the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Place a horizontal block at position 2 above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

5. Place a horizontal block at position 3 above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```
