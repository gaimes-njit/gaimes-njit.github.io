To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical block at position 0:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

2. Place another vertical block at position 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. Place a horizontal block at position 1, above the two vertical blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

4. Place another vertical block at position 1, above the horizontal block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

5. Place a horizontal block at position 1, above the vertical block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

Following these steps, we should be able to generate the uppercase English letter "J" in the Tetris-like environment while ensuring structural stability and adherence to gravity rules.
