To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we will follow the same approach as mentioned for the letter "B". 

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "J":

```  
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Make sure to execute these commands consecutively in order to achieve the desired letter shape while maintaining structural stability.
