To generate the capital letter "J", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal block on the bottom row to create a stable foundation:
```ab_drop('b31', 1)```

2. Place two vertical blocks on top of the previous one, aligned with the right side:
```ab_drop('b13', 3)```
```ab_drop('b13', 3)```

3. Finally, place a horizontal block on top of the two vertical blocks to complete the letter:
```ab_drop('b31', 1)```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "J" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
