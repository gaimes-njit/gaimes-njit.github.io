To generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the left vertical stroke of the letter:
   - Drop a b13 block at position 1 to create the base of the left vertical stroke.

2. Next, create the diagonal stroke of the letter:
   - Drop a b11 block at position 2 to create the connection between the left vertical stroke and the diagonal stroke.

3. Now, create the horizontal stroke of the letter:
   - Drop a b31 block at position 3 to create the base of the horizontal stroke.

4. Finally, complete the right vertical stroke of the letter:
   - Drop a b13 block at position 4 to create the top of the right vertical stroke.

The stream of commands to generate the letter "K" would look as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Please note that these commands assume a grid with 20W and 16H, with positions indexed from 1 to 19 and 1 to 15 respectively, and that the stacking and stability rules are followed to avoid invalid shapes.
