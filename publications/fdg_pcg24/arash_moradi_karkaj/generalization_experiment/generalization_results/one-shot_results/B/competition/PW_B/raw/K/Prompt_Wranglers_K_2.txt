To generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Bottom-left leg of K
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Top-left leg of K
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Bottom-right leg of K
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Top-right leg of K
```

This will create a structure that resembles the letter "K" while maintaining stability and balance within the defined environment.
