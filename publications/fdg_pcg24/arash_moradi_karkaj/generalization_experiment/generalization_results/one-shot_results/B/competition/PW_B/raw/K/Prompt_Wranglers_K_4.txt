To generate uppercase letter "K", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by building the left vertical line of the letter:
   - ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Place a vertical block at position x=0
   - ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place another vertical block at position x=2

2. Build the diagonal line of the letter:
   - ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a single block at position x=1
   - ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a single block at position x=3

3. Build the right vertical line of the letter:
   - ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Place a vertical block at position x=0
   - ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place another vertical block at position x=4

4. Build the horizontal line of the letter to complete the top part:
   - ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal block at position x=1

The final sequence of commands to generate the letter "K" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively and in the given order to generate the letter accurately.
