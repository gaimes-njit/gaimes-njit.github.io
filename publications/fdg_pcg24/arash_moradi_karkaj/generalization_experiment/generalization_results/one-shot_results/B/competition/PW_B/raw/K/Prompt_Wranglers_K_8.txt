To generate the uppercase letter "K", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal block (b31) at position 1 to serve as the bottom of the letter:
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

2. Next, place a vertical block (b13) at position 1, slightly above the previous block:
   ab_drop('b13', 1)

3. Place another vertical block (b13) at position 1, above the previous block:
   ab_drop('b13', 1)

4. Now, place a horizontal block (b31) at position 2, slightly above the previous blocks:
   ab_drop('b31', 2)

5. Finally, place a vertical block (b13) at position 2, above the previous block:
   ab_drop('b13', 2)

The resulting stream of commands to generate the letter "K" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
