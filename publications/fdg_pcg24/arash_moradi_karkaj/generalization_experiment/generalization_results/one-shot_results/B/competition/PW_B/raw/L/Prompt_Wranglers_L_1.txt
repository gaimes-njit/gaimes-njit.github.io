To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to the right of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to the right of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

The resulting stream of commands to generate the letter "L" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```
