To generate the uppercase letter "L" using the mentioned block types, the following sequence of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Bottom horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Left vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Right vertical block
```

This sequence of commands builds the letter "L" from bottom to top. The bottom horizontal block is placed first, followed by the left and right vertical blocks. This creates the shape of the letter "L" while maintaining stability and balance.
