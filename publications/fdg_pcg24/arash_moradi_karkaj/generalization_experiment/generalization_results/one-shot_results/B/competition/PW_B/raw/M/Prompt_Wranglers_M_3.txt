To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal block of type b31 at position 1:
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

2. Next, place two vertical blocks of type b13 at positions 0 and 2:
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)

3. Place another horizontal block of type b31 at position 1 to form the middle part of the "M":
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

4. Add two more vertical blocks of type b13 at positions 0 and 2:
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)

5. Finally, place another horizontal block of type b31 at position 1 to complete the letter:
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

The complete sequence of commands to generate the letter "M" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
