To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start from the bottom and build a symmetrical and balanced foundation by placing two vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Move to the middle layer and place a horizontal straight block on top of the previous two blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Place two vertical blocks on top of the current structure:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Place another horizontal straight block on top of the current structure:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. Place two more vertical blocks on top of the current structure:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

6. Finally, place a horizontal straight block on top to complete the letter "M":
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
