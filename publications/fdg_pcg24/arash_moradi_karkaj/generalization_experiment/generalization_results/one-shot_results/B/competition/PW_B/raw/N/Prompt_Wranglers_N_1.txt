To generate the uppercase English letter "N" using the specified block types and gravity rules, follow these steps:

1. Start from the bottom of the letter and build a stable foundation using two vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Move up to the next layer and place a horizontal block on top of the previous two vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Continue building the middle layer by adding two vertical blocks on top of the horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

4. Finally, complete the letter "N" by placing another horizontal block on top of the middle layer:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The resulting sequence of commands to generate the letter "N" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
