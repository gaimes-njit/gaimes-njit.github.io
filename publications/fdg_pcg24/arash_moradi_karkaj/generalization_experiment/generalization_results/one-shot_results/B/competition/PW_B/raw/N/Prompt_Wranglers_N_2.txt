To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by building the left vertical line of the letter "N" using two vertical blocks (b13).
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

2. Move to the right and build the diagonal line of the letter "N" using a horizontal block (b31).
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 4)
   ab_drop('b31', 3)
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

3. Complete the letter "N" by building the right vertical line using two vertical blocks (b13).
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "N" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
