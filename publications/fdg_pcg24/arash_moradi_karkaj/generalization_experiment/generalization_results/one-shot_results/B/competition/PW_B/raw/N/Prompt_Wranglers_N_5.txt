To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Move to the next structural layer and place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Move to the next structural layer and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. Move to the next structural layer and place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

6. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

7. Move to the next structural layer and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "N" while ensuring structural stability according to the defined gravity rules.
