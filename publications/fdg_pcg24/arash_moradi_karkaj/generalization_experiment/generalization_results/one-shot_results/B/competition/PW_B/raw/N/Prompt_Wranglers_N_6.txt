To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by building the left side of the letter. Add two vertical blocks on the bottom layer:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

2. Move to the next structural layer and add a horizontal block to connect the two vertical blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

3. Add two more vertical blocks on top of the horizontal block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

4. Finally, complete the letter "N" by adding another horizontal block on top:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

Now, putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the letter "N" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

By following these commands, you will be able to construct the uppercase English letter "N" in the Tetris-like environment while maintaining its stability and shape.
