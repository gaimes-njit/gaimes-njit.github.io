To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by building the left vertical line of the letter:
   - Place a vertical block (b13) at position 1.
   - Place a vertical block (b13) at position 2.
   - Place a vertical block (b13) at position 3.

2. Move to the right side of the letter and build the diagonal line:
   - Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 4.
   - Place a vertical block (b13) at positions 5 and 6.

3. Complete the letter by building the right vertical line:
   - Place a vertical block (b13) at positions 7, 8, and 9.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "N":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)

ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Executing these commands in order will create a stable and balanced representation of the letter "N" within the defined boundaries of the environment.
