To create the letter "O" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by creating the bottom part of the letter "O" using two horizontal blocks arranged in a straight line. We will use the block type "b31" and place it at positions 1 and 2 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, we need to add two vertical blocks on either side of the bottom part to create the sides of the letter "O". We will use the block type "b13" and place it at positions 0 and 3 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Finally, we need to add a horizontal block at the top to complete the letter "O". We will again use the block type "b31" and place it at position 1 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Putting it all together, the complete stream of commands to generate the letter "O" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
