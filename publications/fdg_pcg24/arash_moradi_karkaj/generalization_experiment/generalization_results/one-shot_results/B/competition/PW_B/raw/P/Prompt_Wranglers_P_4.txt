To generate the uppercase English letter "P", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will build the letter "P" in the defined environment, ensuring structural stability and balance.
