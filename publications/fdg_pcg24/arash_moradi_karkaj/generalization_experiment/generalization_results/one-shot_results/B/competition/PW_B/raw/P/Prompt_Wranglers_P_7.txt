To generate uppercase English letter "P", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by creating the vertical stem of the letter "P" using two vertical blocks:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

2. Next, place a horizontal block on top of the vertical stem, creating the top bar of the letter "P":
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   ```

3. To complete the shape of the letter "P", place two vertical blocks on top of the horizontal block:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

Taking all the steps together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "P" would be:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
