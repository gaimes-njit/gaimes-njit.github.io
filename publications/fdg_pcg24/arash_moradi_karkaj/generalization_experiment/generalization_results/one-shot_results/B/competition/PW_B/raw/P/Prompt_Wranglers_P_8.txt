To generate the capital letter "P" using the given block types and the defined environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the vertical straight block on the left side of the grid:
   ab_drop('b13', 1)

2. Move one unit to the right and create the horizontal straight block:
   ab_drop('b31', 2)

3. Move one unit to the right and create the vertical straight block on the right side of the grid:
   ab_drop('b13', 3)

4. Move one unit to the left and create the horizontal straight block connected to the previous one:
   ab_drop('b31', 2)

5. Move one unit to the right and create the vertical straight block on the right side of the previous block:
   ab_drop('b13', 3)

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 two more times to create the middle section of the letter "P".

7. Finally, create the horizontal straight block on the top of the middle section:
   ab_drop('b31', 2)

The complete stream of commands to generate the capital letter "P" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
