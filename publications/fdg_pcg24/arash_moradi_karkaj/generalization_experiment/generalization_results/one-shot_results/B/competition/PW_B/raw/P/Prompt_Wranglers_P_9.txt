A possible solution to generate the uppercase English letter "P" using the specified block types is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This solution builds the letter "P" from bottom to top, ensuring structural stability by stacking the blocks one by one. The letter "P" is symmetric and balanced, with a vertical line on the left side and a horizontal line connecting the top of the vertical line.
