To generate the uppercase English letter "Q", we can follow a similar approach as the letter "B" example. Here's one possible solution:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

This set of commands will create a stable and balanced representation of the letter "Q" within the given grid.
