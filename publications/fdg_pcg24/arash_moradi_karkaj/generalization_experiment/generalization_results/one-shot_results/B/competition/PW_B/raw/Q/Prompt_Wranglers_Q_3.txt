To generate uppercase English letter "Q", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by building the base of the letter "Q" using two vertical blocks:
   - ab_drop('b13', 1)
   - ab_drop('b13', 2)

2. On top of the base, add a horizontal block to form the top curve of the letter "Q":
   - ab_drop('b31', 1)

3. To complete the letter "Q", add a vertical block on the right side to form the tail:
   - ab_drop('b13', 3)

The sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate uppercase English letter "Q" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
