To generate the uppercase English letter "Q", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by creating the bottom part of the letter:
ab_drop(b31, 1)

2. Move to the next structural layer and add two vertical blocks:
ab_drop(b13, 0)
ab_drop(b13, 2)

3. Place another horizontal block on top:
ab_drop(b31, 1)

4. Add two more vertical blocks on top:
ab_drop(b13, 0)
ab_drop(b13, 2)

5. Finally, complete the letter with the top part:
ab_drop(b31, 1)
