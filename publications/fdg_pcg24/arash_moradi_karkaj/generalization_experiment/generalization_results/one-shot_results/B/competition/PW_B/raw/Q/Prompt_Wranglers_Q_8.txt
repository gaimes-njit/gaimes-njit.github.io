To generate uppercase English letter "Q" using the mentioned command and block types in the defined environment, you can follow the following steps:

1. Start by building the base of the letter 'Q'. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1:

ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Move to the next structural layer and place two vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 0 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Build the middle section of the letter 'Q' by placing another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Add two more vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 0 and 2 to complete the middle section:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

5. Finish building the top of the letter 'Q' by placing another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This completes the construction of the letter 'Q'.
