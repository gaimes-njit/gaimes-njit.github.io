To generate the uppercase letter "Q", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by building the foundation of the letter. Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 1.
``` ab_drop('b31', 1) ```

2. Add a vertical block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 0.
``` ab_drop('b13', 0) ```

3. Add another vertical block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 2.
``` ab_drop('b13', 2) ```

4. Place another horizontal block (b31) on top of the previous structure at position 1.
``` ab_drop('b31', 1) ```

5. Place a vertical block (b13) on top of the previous structure at position 0.
``` ab_drop('b13', 0) ```

6. Place another vertical block (b13) on top of the previous structure at position 2.
``` ab_drop('b13', 2) ```

7. Add a horizontal block (b31) on top of the previous structure at position 1.
``` ab_drop('b31', 1) ```

8. Finally, add a horizontal block (b31) on top of the previous structure at position 0.
``` ab_drop('b31', 0) ```

These commands will generate the uppercase letter "Q" in the Tetris-like environment while maintaining structural stability.
