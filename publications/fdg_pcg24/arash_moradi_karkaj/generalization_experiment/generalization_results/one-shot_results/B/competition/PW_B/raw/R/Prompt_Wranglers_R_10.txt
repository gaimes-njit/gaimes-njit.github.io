To construct the uppercase letter "R" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by building the foundation using two vertical blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3:
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)

2. Place a horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical blocks to create the middle part of the letter:
ab_drop('b31', 2)

3. Add another vertical block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 2:
ab_drop('b13', 2)

4. Place two more horizontal blocks (b31) on top of the vertical block to create the top part of the letter:
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)

Following these steps, the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the uppercase letter "R" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```
