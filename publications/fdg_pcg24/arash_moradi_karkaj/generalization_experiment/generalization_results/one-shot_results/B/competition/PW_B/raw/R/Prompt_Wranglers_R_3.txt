To generate the letter "R", we need to follow a similar process as mentioned for the letter "B". The steps to generate the letter "R" are as follows:

1. Start by creating the base of the letter using two horizontal blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

2. Next, place a vertical block on top of the left side of the base:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

3. Now, place another vertical block on top of the right side of the base:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

4. To complete the loop of the letter "R", we need to place a horizontal block on the top right corner:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 3)
   ```

5. Finally, place a diagonal block connecting the top right corner to the bottom right corner to complete the shape of the letter "R":
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 4)
   ab_drop('b11', 5)
   ab_drop('b11', 6)
   ```

The above commands will create the letter "R" in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
