To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the bottom part of the letter "S" using a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Next, we need to place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0 to create the middle section of the letter "S":
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Now, let's add another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 to complete the middle section of the letter "S":
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. To create the top part of the letter "S", we can use a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Overall, the commands needed to generate the uppercase English letter "S" are as follows:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
