To create the uppercase English letter "S", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by creating the bottom horizontal part of the letter using two b31 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

2. Place a b13 block on top of the left b31 block to create the middle vertical part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place another b13 block on top of the right b31 block to complete the middle vertical part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

4. Finally, place two b31 blocks on top of the middle vertical part to create the top horizontal part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

The complete set of commands for generating letter "S" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
