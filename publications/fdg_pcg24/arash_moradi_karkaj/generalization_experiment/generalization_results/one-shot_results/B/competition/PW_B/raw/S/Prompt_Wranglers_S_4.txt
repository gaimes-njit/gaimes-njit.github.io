To generate the uppercase English letter "S":

1. Start by placing a vertical block on the left side of the grid:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place a horizontal block on top of the vertical block, centered:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Place another horizontal block on top of the previous one, centered:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Place a vertical block on the right side of the grid, aligned with the vertical block at the bottom:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

5. Place a horizontal block on top of the vertical block, centered:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

6. Place another horizontal block on top of the previous one, centered:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

7. Place a vertical block on the right side of the grid, aligned with the horizontal blocks at the top:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Make sure to follow the stacking and stability rules while placing the blocks to construct the letter accurately.
