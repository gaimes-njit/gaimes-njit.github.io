To generate the uppercase letter "S" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by building the bottom of the letter, which consists of a horizontal block. Place a b31 block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Move to the next structural layer above the bottom. Add two vertical blocks to create the middle section of the letter. Place a b13 block at position 0 and another one at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Continue building the upper part of the letter. Add another horizontal block to connect the vertical blocks from the previous step. Place a b31 block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Place two more vertical blocks on top of the current structure to complete the letter. Add a b13 block at position 0 and another one at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

These steps should generate the uppercase letter "S" using the given block types.
