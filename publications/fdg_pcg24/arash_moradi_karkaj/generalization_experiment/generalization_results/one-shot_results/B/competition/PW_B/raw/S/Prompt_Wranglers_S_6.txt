To generate the uppercase letter "S", we will follow the same approach of building symmetrical and balanced layers. Here are the commands to generate the letter "S":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable and balanced representation of the letter "S" within the allowed space boundaries.
