To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we will follow the same principles as mentioned in the example for the letter "B". 

First, we start by building the bottom part of the letter "S" using two vertical blocks:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Next, we move to the next structural layer and place a horizontal block on top of the previous two vertical blocks:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Then, we place two vertical blocks on top of the current structure:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Finally, we place the top part of the letter "S" using a horizontal block:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

By following these commands, the letter "S" will be generated while maintaining structural stability within the defined environment.
