To generate the uppercase English letter "T", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal block in the bottom row
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place a vertical block on top of the horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place another vertical block on top of the previous one
ab_drop('b13', 0)   # Place a vertical block to the left of the center block
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place a vertical block to the right of the center block
```

These commands will create a stacked structure of blocks that resemble the uppercase letter "T".
