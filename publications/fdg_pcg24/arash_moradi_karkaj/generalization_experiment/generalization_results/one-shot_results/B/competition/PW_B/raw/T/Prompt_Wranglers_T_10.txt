To generate the uppercase English letter "T", we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at the bottom of the grid, centered at position 10. This will serve as the base of the letter "T".
ab_drop(b31, 10)

Step 2: Place a vertical straight block (b13) at the left of the base, centered at position 8. This will form the left vertical part of the letter "T".
ab_drop(b13, 8)

Step 3: Place another vertical straight block (b13) at the right of the base, centered at position 12. This will form the right vertical part of the letter "T".
ab_drop(b13, 12)

Step 4: Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the base, centered at position 10. This will complete the letter "T".
ab_drop(b31, 10)

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "T" is as follows:
