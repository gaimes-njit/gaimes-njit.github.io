To generate the capital letter "T" using the provided block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block on top of the previous block at positions 0 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Finally, place another horizontal straight block on top of the vertical blocks at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final sequence of commands to generate the letter "T" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
