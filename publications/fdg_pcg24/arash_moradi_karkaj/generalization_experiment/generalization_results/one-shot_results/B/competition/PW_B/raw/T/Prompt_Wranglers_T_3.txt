To create the uppercase letter "T" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1 to the right of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 2 to complete the letter "T":
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The complete sequence of commands to create the letter "T" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
