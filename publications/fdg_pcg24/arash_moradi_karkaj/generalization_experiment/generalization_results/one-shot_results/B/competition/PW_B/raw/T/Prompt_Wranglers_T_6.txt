To generate the uppercase English letter "T", you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal block (b31) at position 1 to act as the base of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical block (b13) at position 2 to create the vertical line of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Continue by placing another horizontal block (b31) at position 1 to complete the horizontal line of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Finally, place a vertical block (b13) at position 0 to create the left side of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

The stream of commands to generate the letter "T" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
