To generate the uppercase English letter "T", you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block to the left of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block to the right of the first block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Complete the letter "T" by placing a horizontal straight block on top of the existing blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final sequence of commands to generate the letter "T" will be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
