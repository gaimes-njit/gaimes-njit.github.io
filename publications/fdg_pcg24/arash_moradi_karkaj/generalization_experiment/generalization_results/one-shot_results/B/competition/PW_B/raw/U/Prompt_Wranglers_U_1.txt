Here is a stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "U":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

These commands will create the letter "U" using the block types and following the structural stability rules in the defined environment.
