To generate the uppercase English letter "U", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by building the bottom of the letter "U" using two vertical blocks:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

2. Next, place a horizontal block on top of the two vertical blocks to create the middle part of the letter:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

3. Finally, place two more vertical blocks on top of the middle block to complete the top part of the letter:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

The complete set of commands to generate the letter "U" would be:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
