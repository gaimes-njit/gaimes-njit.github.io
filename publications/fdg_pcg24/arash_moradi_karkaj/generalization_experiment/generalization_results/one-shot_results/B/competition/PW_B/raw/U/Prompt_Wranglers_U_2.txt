To generate the uppercase English letter "U" using the mentioned command and block types, follow the steps below:

1. Start by building the left vertical line of the letter "U":
   - Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
   - Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3: `ab_drop('b13', 3)`

2. Build the bottom horizontal line of the letter "U":
   - Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 0: `ab_drop('b31', 0)`
   - Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
   - Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

3. Build the right vertical line of the letter "U":
   - Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4: `ab_drop('b13', 4)`
   - Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 6: `ab_drop('b13', 6)`
