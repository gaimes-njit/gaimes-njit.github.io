To generate the uppercase English letter "U," we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical block at position 1 (middle)
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical block at position 3 (middle)
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place a vertical block at position 5 (middle)
ab_drop('b31', 0)  # Place a horizontal block at position 0 (bottom)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal block at position 1 (bottom)
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal block at position 2 (bottom)
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal block at position 3 (bottom)
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place a horizontal block at position 4 (bottom)
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place a horizontal block at position 5 (bottom)
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Place a horizontal block at position 6 (bottom)
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place a horizontal block at position 7 (bottom)
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place a vertical block at position 7 (right)
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place a vertical block at position 9 (right)
ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Place a vertical block at position 11 (right)

The above commands will generate the letter "U" in the Tetris-like environment, satisfying the stacking and stability rules.
