To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block at the bottom, centered at position 1:
   ``` 
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

2. Move up one row and place a vertical straight block at the leftmost position:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

3. Move up one more row and place another vertical straight block at the rightmost position:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

4. Move up one more row and place a horizontal straight block at the center:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

5. Move up one more row and place a vertical straight block at the leftmost position:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

6. Move up one more row and place another vertical straight block at the rightmost position:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

7. Move up one more row and place a horizontal straight block at the center:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

The above sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "V" while maintaining structural stability.
