To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block at position 0 and also at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place another horizontal straight block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This completes the construction of the letter "V". The final set of commands is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
