Here is the stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "V":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by placing a vertical block ('b13') at position 1 to create the left side of the letter "V".
2. Then, we place a horizontal block ('b31') at position 1 to create the bottom part of the "V".
3. Next, we place another vertical block ('b13') at position 3 to complete the right side of the "V".
4. We continue by placing a vertical block ('b13') at position 0 to create the left side of the top part of the "V".
5. Then, we place a 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 1 to create the top point of the "V".
6. Finally, we place another 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 2 to complete the top part of the "V".

This sequence of commands forms the uppercase English letter "V" in the defined environment while maintaining stability and balance.
