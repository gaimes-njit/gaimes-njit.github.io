To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
   ```ab_drop('b13', 1)```

   This creates the left side of the letter "V".

2. Next, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
   ```ab_drop('b31', 2)```

   This connects the left side to the right side of the letter "V".

3. Now, place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3:
   ```ab_drop('b13', 3)```

   This completes the right side of the letter "V".

The final sequence of commands to generate the letter "V" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
