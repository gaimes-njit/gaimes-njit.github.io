To generate the uppercase letter "V" using the given block types, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the two vertical sides of the letter "V" using two vertical blocks (b13). Place the first block at position 1 and the second block at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Next, add the middle section of the letter "V" using a horizontal block (b31). Place it at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Complete the letter "V" by adding two more vertical blocks (b13) on top of the middle section. Place the first block at position 1 and the second block at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

The final set of commands to generate the uppercase letter "V" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
