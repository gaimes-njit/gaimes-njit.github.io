To generate the uppercase letter "W" using the given block types and environment, we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
# Step 1: Create the left bottom part of the letter "W"
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Step 2: Create the middle part of the letter "W"
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Step 3: Create the right bottom part of the letter "W"
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Step 4: Create the top part of the letter "W"
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

Please note that the above commands assume that the initial state of the grid is empty. If there are any existing blocks or obstacles in the grid, adjustments may need to be made to the commands to avoid collisions or invalid shape. Additionally, to maintain stability, it is important to ensure that the height boundaries (16H) are not exceeded at any step.
