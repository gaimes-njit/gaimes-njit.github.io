Here is an example of how to generate the uppercase English letter "W":

Always start from the bottom to build a symmetrical and balanced foundation:
ab_drop('b31', 1)
Next, place two vertical blocks on top of the previous layer, slightly offset to form the two bottom points of the "W":
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
Then, place a horizontal block on top of the two vertical blocks to form the middle line of the "W":
ab_drop('b31', 0)
Next, place two vertical blocks on top of the middle line, aligned with the bottom points:
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
Finally, place a horizontal block on top of the two vertical blocks to form the top line of the "W":
ab_drop('b31', 1)

This sequence of commands should generate the uppercase English letter "W" in the defined environment while maintaining structural stability and balance.
