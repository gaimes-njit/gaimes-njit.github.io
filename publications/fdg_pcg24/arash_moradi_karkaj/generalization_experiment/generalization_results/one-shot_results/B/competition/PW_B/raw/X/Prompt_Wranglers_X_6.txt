To generate the uppercase letter "X" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

2. Move to the next structural layer and place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 0 and 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. Proceed to the next structural layer and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

4. Move to the top layer and place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 0 and 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

By following these steps, the uppercase letter "X" can be generated in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
