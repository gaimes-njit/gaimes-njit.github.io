To generate the uppercase letter "X" using the given block types, you can follow the following steps:

1. Start by building the bottom-left arm of the "X":
   - Place a horizontal block (`b31`) at position 1.
   - Place a vertical block (`b13`) at position 0.
   - Place a vertical block (`b13`) at position 2.
   - Place a horizontal block (`b31`) at position 1.

2. Move to the top-right arm of the "X":
   - Place a vertical block (`b13`) at position 0.
   - Place a vertical block (`b13`) at position 2.

3. Finally, place the top-center block of the "X":
   - Place a horizontal block (`b31`) at position 1.

The complete set of commands to generate the uppercase letter "X" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
