To generate uppercase English letter "Y", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by building the base of the letter by stacking two vertical blocks next to each other:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal block on top of the two vertical blocks to create the upper part of the letter:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Stack a vertical block below the horizontal block to maintain stability:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Finally, add a vertical block on top of the horizontal block to complete the letter:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "Y" would be:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
