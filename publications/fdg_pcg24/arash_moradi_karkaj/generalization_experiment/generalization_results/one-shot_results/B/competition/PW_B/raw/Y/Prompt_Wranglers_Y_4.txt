To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical block (b13) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Place another vertical block (b13) at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

4. Place another horizontal block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

5. Place a vertical block (b13) at position 4:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

These commands will construct the uppercase letter "Y" while maintaining stability and balance within the allowed space boundaries.
