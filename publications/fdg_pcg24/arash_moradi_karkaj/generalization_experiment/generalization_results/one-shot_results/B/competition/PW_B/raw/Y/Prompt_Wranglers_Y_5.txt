To generate the uppercase letter "Y", we can follow the following steps:

- First, we start by building the left vertical stem of the "Y" using the b13 block type:
    - ab_drop('b13', 1) to place the block at position 1 along the width.
    - ab_drop('b13', 1) to place another block on top of the previous one.
    - ab_drop('b13', 1) to place the third block on top of the previous two.
    
- Next, we move to the next structural layer and build the horizontal crossbar of the "Y" using the b31 block type:
    - ab_drop('b31', 0) to place the block at position 0 along the width.
    - ab_drop('b31', 1) to place the block at position 1 along the width.
    - ab_drop('b31', 2) to place the block at position 2 along the width.
    
- Finally, we complete the right vertical stem of the "Y" using the b13 block type:
    - ab_drop('b13', 2) to place the block at position 2 along the width.
    - ab_drop('b13', 2) to place another block on top of the previous one.
    - ab_drop('b13', 2) to place the third block on top of the previous two.

Here is the complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "Y":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
