To construct the uppercase letter "Y" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by building the base of the letter. Place a horizontal block of type 'b31' at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Now, add two vertical blocks of type 'b13' on either side of the base. Place one block at position 0 and the other at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Next, place a horizontal block of type 'b31' on top of the base, aligned with the previous horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Now, add two vertical blocks of type 'b13' on top of the previous structure, in the same positions as before:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

5. Finally, complete the letter by placing one more horizontal block of type 'b31' on top, aligned with the previous horizontal blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "Y" is as follows:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
