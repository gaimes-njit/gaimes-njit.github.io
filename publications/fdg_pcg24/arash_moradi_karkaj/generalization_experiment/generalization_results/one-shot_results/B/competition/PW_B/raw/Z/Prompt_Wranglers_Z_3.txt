To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at the bottom of the grid: 
   `ab_drop('b31', 1)`

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at the bottom-left corner of the previous block:
   `ab_drop('b13', 0)`

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at the top-right corner of the previous block:
   `ab_drop('b13', 2)`

4. Move up one row and place a horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle of the grid:
   `ab_drop('b31', 1)`

5. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at the bottom-left corner of the previous block:
   `ab_drop('b13', 0)`

6. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at the top-right corner of the previous block:
   `ab_drop('b13', 2)`

7. Finally, move up one more row and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at the top of the grid:
   `ab_drop('b31', 1)`

The above commands will generate the uppercase English letter "Z" in the grid.
