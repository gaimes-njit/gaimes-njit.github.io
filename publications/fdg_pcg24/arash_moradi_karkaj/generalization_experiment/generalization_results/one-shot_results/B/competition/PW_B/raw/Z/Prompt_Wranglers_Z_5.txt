To generate the uppercase English letter "Z" using the mentioned block types and commands, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by creating the bottom layer of the letter "Z" using two horizontal blocks and one vertical block:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Move up to the next structural layer and place two vertical blocks:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Finally, complete the letter "Z" by adding the top horizontal block:

ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

By following these steps, we can generate the uppercase English letter "Z" in the defined environment while maintaining structural stability and adhering to the gravity rules.
