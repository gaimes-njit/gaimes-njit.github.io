To generate the uppercase letter "Z" using the given block types, follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the first horizontal line of the "Z" shape:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

2. Move to the next structural layer and create a vertical line, offset by one unit from the left:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

3. Create another vertical line, offset by three units from the left:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

4. Move to the next structural layer and create the second horizontal line, offset by one unit from the left:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

5. Move to the next structural layer and create a vertical line, offset by one unit from the left:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

6. Create another vertical line, offset by three units from the left:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

7. Move to the topmost structural layer and create the final horizontal line, offset by one unit from the left:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

These commands will generate the letter "Z" while ensuring structural stability and gravity rules within the defined environment.
