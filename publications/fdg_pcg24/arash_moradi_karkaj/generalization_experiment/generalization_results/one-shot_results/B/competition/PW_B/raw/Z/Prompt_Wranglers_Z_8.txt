To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical blocks on the bottom to create a stable foundation:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal block on top of the two vertical blocks to create the first layer:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Place a vertical block on the left side of the first layer to create the second layer:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Place a horizontal block on top of the second layer to create the third layer:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. Place a vertical block on the right side of the third layer to create the fourth layer:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

6. Place two vertical blocks on top of the fourth layer to create the top part of the letter "Z":
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

7. Finally, place a horizontal block on top of the top part to complete the letter "Z":
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
