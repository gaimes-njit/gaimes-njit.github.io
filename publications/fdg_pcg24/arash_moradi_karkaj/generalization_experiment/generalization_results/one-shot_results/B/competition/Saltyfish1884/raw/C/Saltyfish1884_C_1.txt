To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "C" and meets all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code snippet:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a horizontal block (b31) on the bottom layer (layer 0) to serve as the base:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will drop the b31 block with its center aligned to slot 9. As a result, the structure will have a solid base to support the other blocks.

3. Place two vertical blocks (b13) on top of the base to form the vertical sides of the character "C":
```
ab_drop('b13', 7) # Left vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 11) # Right vertical block
```
These two blocks will create the curved shape of the character "C".

4. Place a horizontal block (b31) on top of the left vertical block to complete the horizontal portion of the character "C":
```
ab_drop('b31', 7) # Top horizontal block
```

5. Verify stability and adjust block positions if needed to ensure the structure is stable and does not collapse. The provided ab_drop() function takes care of ensuring the blocks are dropped in a stable manner.

6. The final structure will resemble the character "C" and satisfy all the hard constraints.

Note: The exact slot positions and order of block placement may vary based on the starting empty structure and random selections in the ab_drop() function. The above steps provide a general approach to achieving the desired structure.
