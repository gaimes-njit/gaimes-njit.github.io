To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b11 block at the bottom center of the structure to act as the base:

```python
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
```

3. Drop a b31 block on top of the base block to form the vertical part of the "H":

```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```

4. Drop a b11 block on top of the vertical block to complete the vertical part of the "H":

```python
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
```

5. Drop a b31 block next to the vertical part to form the horizontal part of the "H":

```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2 + 2)
```

6. Drop a b11 block on top of the horizontal block to complete the horizontal part of the "H":

```python
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 + 2)
```

By following these steps, the ab_drop() function will place the suitable blocks to form the structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all the hard constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.

Note: Please make sure to define the ab_drop() function and the required block types before running the code. Also, adjust the slot numbers according to the desired positions of the blocks.
