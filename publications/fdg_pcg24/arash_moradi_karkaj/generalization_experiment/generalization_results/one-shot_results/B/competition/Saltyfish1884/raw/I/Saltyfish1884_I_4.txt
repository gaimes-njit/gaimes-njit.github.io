To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base of the structure by vertically dropping a b11 block in the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

3. Place the blocks for the vertical segments of the "I" character. Since the height of the b13 block is 3 units, we can place two b13 blocks on top of the base, aligned with the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Place the block for the horizontal segment of the "I" character. Since the width of the b31 block is 3 units, we can place it on top of the vertical segments, aligned with the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

5. Check if the resulting structure meets all hard constraints:
- Stability: The b31 block is placed on top of the b13 blocks, which are placed on the base. This satisfies the stability requirements.
- Structure should not be separated: The blocks are adjacent to each other, ensuring that the structure is not separated.
- No boundary intrusion: The blocks are placed in such a way that they do not intrude on the boundary.

6. The final structure will be a stable structure that resembles the character "I". You can print the structure to visualize the result:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This will generate a new stable structure that resembles the character "I" while meeting all the given requirements.
