To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "O" while meeting all the given constraints, we need to follow these steps:

1. Starting from the bottom layer (layer 0), drop a b11 block at the center slot (slot 10) using the ab_drop() function. This will serve as the base of the structure.

2. Drop a b31 block on top of the base, aligned with the center of the base. This will create the lower part of the "O" shape.

3. Drop another b11 block on top of the lower part, aligned with the center of the lower part. This will create the middle part of the "O" shape.

4. Drop a b31 block on top of the middle part, aligned with the center of the middle part. This will create the upper part of the "O" shape.

5. Drop a b11 block on top of the upper part, aligned with the center of the upper part. This will close the "O" shape.

6. The structure should be stable and resemble the character "O". The structure should also not intrude on the map's boundary.

Here is the code that implements the above steps:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# ab_drop function
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Step 1: Drop a b11 block at the center slot on layer 0
ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Step 2: Drop a b31 block on top of the base
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Step 3: Drop a b11 block on top of the lower part
ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Step 4: Drop a b31 block on top of the middle part
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Step 5: Drop a b11 block on top of the upper part
ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Print the structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The output of this code will be a stable structure that resembles the character "O" while satisfying all the given constraints.
