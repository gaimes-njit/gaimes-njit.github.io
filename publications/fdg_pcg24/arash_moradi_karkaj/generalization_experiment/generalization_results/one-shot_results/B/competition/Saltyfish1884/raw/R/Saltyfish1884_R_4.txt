To generate a stable structure resembling the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Define the shape of the structure:
   - The structure will be a combination of b31 blocks and b13 blocks to resemble the letter "R".
   - The first layer of the structure will consist of two b11 blocks, forming the base of the letter.
   - The second layer will have a b31 block placed on top of the two b11 blocks, forming the stem of the letter.
   - The third and fourth layers will have a b13 block each, placed on the sides of the stem, forming the legs of the letter.
   - The top layer will be left empty.

2. Initialize the structure:
   
```
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

3. Place the blocks using the ab_drop() function:
   - Drop the b31 block first on the second layer at slot 9 using:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', 9)
     ```
   - Drop the two b11 blocks on the first layer at slots 8 and 10 using:
     ```
     ab_drop('b11', 8)
     ab_drop('b11', 10)
     ```
   - Drop the two b13 blocks on the third and fourth layers at slots 7 and 11 using:
     ```
     ab_drop('b13', 7)
     ab_drop('b13', 11)
     ```

4. Print the resulting structure:
   ```
   for row in structure:
       print(' '.join(row))
   ```

This will generate a stable structure resembling the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints.
