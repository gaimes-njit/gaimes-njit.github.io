To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Z" using the ab_drop() function and meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the step-by-step approach outlined below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. First, we need to consider the stability constraint. The b31 block should be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. We can start by placing a b31 block on the bottom layer (layer 0) in the middle slot (slot 10) as the base. Use the ab_drop() function to place the block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

3. Next, we can place a b11 block on top of the base block, centered in the leftmost slot (slot 0) to complete the left side of the "Z" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

4. Now, we need to place the vertical b13 block to complete the right side of the "Z" shape. Place it on the bottom layer (layer 0) in the rightmost slot (slot 19):
```python
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```

5. We can now place the final b11 block on top of the vertical block, centered in the rightmost slot (slot 19):
```python
ab_drop('b11', 19)
```

6. The structure should now resemble the character "Z" and is stable, meeting the hard constraints. To visualize the final structure, print the grid:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The above steps outline the process of using the ab_drop() function to generate a stable structure resembling the character "Z" while meeting all the given hard constraints. You can modify the code to generate different structures by adjusting the block types and positions accordingly.
