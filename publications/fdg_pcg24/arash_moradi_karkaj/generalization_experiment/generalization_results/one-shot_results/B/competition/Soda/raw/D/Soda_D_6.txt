To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "D" in a level, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the base of the "D": We start by dropping a row block (b31) centered at position 9. This will form the base of the letter "D".
   ```
   ab_drop("b31", 9)
   ```

2. Place the vertical line of the "D": Next, we drop a column block (b13) centered at position 15. This will form the vertical line of the letter "D".
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 15)
   ```

3. Place the top part of the "D": Finally, we drop a row block (b31) centered at position 14. This will form the top part of the letter "D".
   ```
   ab_drop("b31", 14)
   ```

The complete implementation would look like this:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 15)
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```
