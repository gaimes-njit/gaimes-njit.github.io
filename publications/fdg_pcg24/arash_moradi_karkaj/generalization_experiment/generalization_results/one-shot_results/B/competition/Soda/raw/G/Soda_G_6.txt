To generate a structure that looks like the capital character "G" in the level, we can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Place the base blocks of the "G" structure.
Since the "G" structure has two horizontal bars (top and bottom) and a vertical bar on the right side, we need to place three blocks in total.

ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the bottom horizontal bar at x_position 9
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Place the top horizontal bar at x_position 10
ab_drop("b13", 12)  # Place the vertical bar at x_position 12

Step 2: Place the top part of the "G" structure.
The top part of the "G" structure is a half ellipse shape. We can achieve this by placing a combination of row and column blocks.

ab_drop("b13", 12)  # Place a column block at x_position 12
ab_drop("b13", 13)  # Place a column block at x_position 13
ab_drop("b13", 14)  # Place a column block at x_position 14
ab_drop("b11", 15)  # Place a square block at x_position 15
ab_drop("b11", 16)  # Place a square block at x_position 16

Step 3: Place the middle part of the "G" structure.
The middle part of the "G" structure is a horizontal bar placed between the top and bottom bars.

ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Place the middle horizontal bar at x_position 10

Step 4: Adjust the stability of the structure.
The structure built so far might not be completely stable, especially the top part. We can adjust the stability by placing additional blocks.

ab_drop("b31", 12)  # Adjust the stability of the top part at x_position 12

The complete implementation to generate the "G" structure is shown below:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the bottom horizontal bar at x_position 9
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Place the top horizontal bar at x_position 10
ab_drop("b13", 12)  # Place the vertical bar at x_position 12
ab_drop("b13", 12)  # Place a column block at x_position 12
ab_drop("b13", 13)  # Place a column block at x_position 13
ab_drop("b13", 14)  # Place a column block at x_position 14
ab_drop("b11", 15)  # Place a square block at x_position 15
ab_drop("b11", 16)  # Place a square block at x_position 16
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Place the middle horizontal bar at x_position 10
ab_drop("b31", 12)  # Adjust the stability of the top part at x_position 12
```

Please note that the stability and similarity of the structure may vary depending on the specific gravity and orientation of the game. The given implementation aims to achieve the best stability and similarity based on the provided instructions.
