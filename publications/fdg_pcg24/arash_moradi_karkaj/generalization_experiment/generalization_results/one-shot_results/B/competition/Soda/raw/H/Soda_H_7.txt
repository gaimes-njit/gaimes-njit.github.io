To create the letter "H" in the level, we will implement it using three blocks: a row block, a column block, and another row block.

1. First, we will drop a row block at the bottom of the level, centered at position 9:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Next, we will drop a column block above the row block, centered at position 9:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

3. Finally, we will drop another row block above the column block, centered at position 9:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to create the letter "H" in the level is:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
