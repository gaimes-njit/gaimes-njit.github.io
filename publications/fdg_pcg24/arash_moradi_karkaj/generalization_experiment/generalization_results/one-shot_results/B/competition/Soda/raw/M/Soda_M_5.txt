To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital character "M", we can break it down into individual blocks and place them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the base blocks for the left and right vertical lines of the "M":
    - Place a column block (b13) at x_position=7 for the left vertical line.
    - Place a column block (b13) at x_position=12 for the right vertical line.

2. Place the middle row block for the top bar of the "M":
    - Place a row block (b31) at x_position=4.

3. Place the top row block for the slanted lines of the "M":
    - Place a row block (b31) at x_position=1.
    - Place a row block (b31) at x_position=7.
    - Place a row block (b31) at x_position=12.
    - Place a row block (b31) at x_position=18.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 18)
```

This implementation places the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion and creates a structure that resembles the capital character "M". The blocks are balanced and well-supported, ensuring stability.
