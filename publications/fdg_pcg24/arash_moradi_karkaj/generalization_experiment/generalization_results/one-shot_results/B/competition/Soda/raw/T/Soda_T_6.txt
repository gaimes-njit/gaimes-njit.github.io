To generate a structure that looks like the capital character "T", we need to build it in a bottom-to-top fashion. Let's break down the process into steps:

Step 1: Create the horizontal bar of the "T"
To create the horizontal bar of the "T", we can use the block "b31" and place it in the middle of the grid.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Step 2: Create the vertical bar of the "T"
To create the vertical bar of the "T", we can use the block "b13". We need to place it just below the horizontal bar and centered.

ab_drop("b13", 9)

Step 3: Create the base of the "T"
To create the base of the "T", we can use another block "b31". We need to place it at the bottom of the grid and centered.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
