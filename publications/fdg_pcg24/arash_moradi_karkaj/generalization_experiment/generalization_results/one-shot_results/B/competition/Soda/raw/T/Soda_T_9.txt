To create a structure that resembles the capital letter "T" on the 2D grid, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the base of the "T" using the "b31" block type.
Start by placing the "b31" block at the center of the grid, which is at x_position=9.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Step 2: Place the vertical part of the "T" using the "b13" block type.
Next, place the "b13" block vertically on top of the base. The center of the block should align with the center of the base.
To achieve this, we need to place the "b13" block at x_position=9.

ab_drop("b13", 9)

After executing the above code blocks, the structure will resemble the capital letter "T" in the top-down orientation.
