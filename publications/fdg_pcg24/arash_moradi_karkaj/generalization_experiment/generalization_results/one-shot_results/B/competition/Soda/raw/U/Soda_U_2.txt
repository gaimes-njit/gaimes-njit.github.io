To generate a structure in the shape of a capital letter "U," we can follow these steps:

1. Create the base of the "U" shape:
    - Drop a block of type "b31" at x_position = 5.
    - Drop a block of type "b31" at x_position = 6.

2. Create the sides of the "U" shape:
    - Drop a block of type "b13" at x_position = 4.
    - Drop a block of type "b13" at x_position = 7.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```
