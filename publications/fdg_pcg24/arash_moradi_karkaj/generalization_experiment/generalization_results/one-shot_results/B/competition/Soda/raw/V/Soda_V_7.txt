To generate a structure that looks like a capital "V" in the level, we can break it down into several steps:

Step 1: Place the bottom horizontal bar of the "V"

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

This will place a row block at x_position=8, creating the bottom horizontal bar of the "V" shape. The cells occupied will be (7, 0), (8, 0), and (9, 0).

Step 2: Place the left diagonal bar of the "V"

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

This will place a column block at x_position=7, creating the left diagonal bar of the "V" shape. The cells occupied will be (7, 1), (7, 0), and (7, -1).

Step 3: Place the right diagonal bar of the "V"

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This will place a column block at x_position=9, creating the right diagonal bar of the "V" shape. The cells occupied will be (9, 1), (9, 0), and (9, -1).

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to generate the "V" shape in the level is:

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
