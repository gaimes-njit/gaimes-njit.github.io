To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "Y" in the Tetris game, we can break down the structure into three blocks: two column blocks and one row block. 

First, we can start by placing the row block in the middle of the grid. Since the width of the grid is 20 columns, the x_position for the row block will be 9 to center it. 

Next, we can place one column block on the left side of the row block. To do this, we can use a block_type of "b13" and set the x_position to 7 to place it just to the left of the row block. 

Finally, we can place the other column block on the right side of the row block. Using a block_type of "b13" again, we can set the x_position to 11 to place it just to the right of the row block. 

This implementation will create a stable structure in the shape of a capital "Y". Below is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```
