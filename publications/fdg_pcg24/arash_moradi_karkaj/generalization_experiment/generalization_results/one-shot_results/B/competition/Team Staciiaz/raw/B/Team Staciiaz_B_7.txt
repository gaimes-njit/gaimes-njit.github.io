To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "B" and meets all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the first block, which is a square block (b11), at position 10 (centered in the middle) using the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
This will place the block on the bottom layer in the center.

3. Next, drop a horizontal block (b31) at position 10, aligned with the previous block, to create the first vertical part of the character "B":
```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```
This will place the block above the previous block, extending it vertically.

4. Now, drop another square block (b11) at position 7, slightly to the left of the previous block, to create the upper part of the character "B":
```
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```
This block will be placed above the previous blocks, extending the vertical part of the "B".

5. Finally, drop another horizontal block (b31) at position 10, aligned with the previous blocks, to complete the character "B":
```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```
This block will be placed above the previous blocks, extending the vertical part of the "B" even further.

By following these steps and carefully choosing the drop positions, we can create a stable structure that looks like the character "B" and meets all the given constraints. The final structure will be stored in the `structure` variable.
