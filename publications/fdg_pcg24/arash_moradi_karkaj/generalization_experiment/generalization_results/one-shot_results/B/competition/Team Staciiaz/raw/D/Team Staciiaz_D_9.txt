To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "D" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a strategic order to form the shape of "D". Based on the given block types, we can start by dropping the b31 block in the bottom-left corner of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Next, drop two b11 blocks above the first block in a vertical arrangement to form the upright segment of the "D":
```python
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

4. Drop a b31 block on top of the upright segment to complete the curve of the "D":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. To meet the stability constraint, determine the appropriate slots for dropping the blocks. You can experiment with different slot positions to find the most stable configuration.

6. Optionally, you can implement boundary intrusion constraint by checking if the positions where blocks are being dropped are within the boundaries of the map (slots 0 to W-1). If a block is being dropped outside the boundaries, you can adjust the slot position or choose a different block type to meet the constraint.

By following these steps, you should be able to generate a stable structure that resembles the character "D" while satisfying the given constraints.
