To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "K" and satisfies the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a strategic manner. Here is an approach to accomplish this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the "K" shape's vertical block (b13) at the center of the map's bottom layer. This will serve as the base of the structure.
```
ab_drop('b13', W // 2)
```

3. Next, drop the two horizontal blocks (b31) on top of the base block, forming the upper and middle parts of the "K" shape.
```
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```

4. Finally, drop the smaller square block (b11) at the top center of the structure to complete the "K" shape.
```
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
```

This sequence of drops satisfies the stability constraint as the blocks are aligned properly, and the resulting structure resembles the character "K". It also satisfies the constraint of no boundary intrusion, as the blocks are placed within the map boundaries.

You can further optimize this arrangement based on specific stability requirements by adjusting the drop positions and order.
