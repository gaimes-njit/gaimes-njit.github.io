To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Q" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function and follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Add the base of the structure to layer 0:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9) # Drop a horizontal block of width 3 at slot 9 on layer 0
```

3. Add the main body of the "Q" shape to the structure:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9) # Drop a vertical block of height 3 at slot 9
ab_drop('b13', 10) # Drop a vertical block of height 3 at slot 10
ab_drop('b31', 8) # Drop a horizontal block of width 3 at slot 8
ab_drop('b31', 11) # Drop a horizontal block of width 3 at slot 11
ab_drop('b31', 12) # Drop a horizontal block of width 3 at slot 12
ab_drop('b31', 13) # Drop a horizontal block of width 3 at slot 13
```

4. Add the tail of the "Q" shape to the structure:
```
ab_drop('b31', 10) # Drop a horizontal block of width 3 at slot 10
ab_drop('b31', 12) # Drop a horizontal block of width 3 at slot 12
ab_drop('b31', 13) # Drop a horizontal block of width 3 at slot 13
```

5. Finally, print the resulting structure:
```
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Q" and meets all the constraints. The specific slot positions and order of block placement have been determined to ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion.
