To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "T" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in the appropriate positions and order.

First, we need to define the shape of the "T" character using the block types provided. We can represent the "T" character using a combination of a b31 block and a b13 block stacked on top of it.

To drop the b31 block, we need to find the appropriate slot position on the bottom layer (layer 0) to ensure stability. We can iterate over all slots and use the `ab_drop()` function to check if the block can be dropped at that position without violating any constraints. To check stability, we can drop a b11 block on top of the b31 block and ensure it doesn't fall off the structure. Once we find a stable slot position, we can drop the b31 block using the `ab_drop()` function.

Next, we need to drop the b13 block on top of the b31 block. We can choose the slot position by finding a slot that aligns with the center slot of the b31 block. Again, we iterate over all slots and use the `ab_drop()` function to check if the block can be dropped at that position without violating any constraints. Once we find a suitable slot position, we can drop the b13 block using the `ab_drop()` function.

The resulting structure will resemble the character "T" and will meet all the constraints.

Here is an example code that generates the stable structure:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # Implementation of ab_drop() function
        
# Drop the b31 block
for slot in range(W):
    if ab_drop('b31', slot):
        break

# Drop the b13 block on top of the b31 block
center_slot = slot + 1  # Assuming the b31 block is centered around a slot
ab_drop('b13', center_slot)
```

This code uses a loop to iterate over all slots and calls the `ab_drop()` function to check if each slot is a suitable position for the b31 block. Once a stable slot position is found, the b31 block is dropped using the `ab_drop()` function. Then, the b13 block is dropped on top of the b31 block by aligning the center slot of the b31 block with a slot position and calling the `ab_drop()` function.

Note: The specific slot positions and order of dropping may vary depending on the constraints and requirements of the block-stacking problem. The provided example code serves as a general guideline to demonstrate the approach.
