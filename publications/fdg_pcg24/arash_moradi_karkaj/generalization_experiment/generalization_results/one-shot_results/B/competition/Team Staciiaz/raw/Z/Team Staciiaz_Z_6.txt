To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Z", we can use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop blocks in a strategic manner, considering the constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.

Here is an approach to generate the structure:

1. Start by dropping a b31 block at slot 0 using `ab_drop('b31', 0)`. This will be the bottom horizontal bar of the "Z" character.

2. Next, drop a b13 block at slot 2 using `ab_drop('b13', 2)`. This will be the vertical bar of the "Z" character.

3. Finally, drop another b31 block at slot 4 using `ab_drop('b31', 4)`. This will be the top horizontal bar of the "Z" character.

The resulting structure will look like the character "Z" and will meet the constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.

Note: The `ab_drop()` function will automatically handle the positioning and order of the blocks based on the drop position and previous blocks. The function ensures that the blocks are dropped in a stable manner by considering the weight and distribution of the structure.
