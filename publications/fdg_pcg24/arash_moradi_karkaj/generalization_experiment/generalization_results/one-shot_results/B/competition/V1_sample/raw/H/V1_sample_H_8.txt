To generate the stable structure resembling the letter "H," follow the steps below:

1. Drop a b13 block at layer 15 (top layer) with its center at slot 9. This block represents the vertical stroke of the "H."

ab drop(b13, 15, 9)

2. Drop a b31 block at layer 14 with its center at slot 9. This block represents the horizontal stroke of the "H."

ab drop(b31, 14, 9)

3. Drop a b13 block at layer 13 with its center at slot 9. This block represents the vertical stroke of the "H."

ab drop(b13, 13, 9)

By following these steps and dropping the blocks in the correct order and position, you will successfully create a stable structure that looks like the letter "H."
