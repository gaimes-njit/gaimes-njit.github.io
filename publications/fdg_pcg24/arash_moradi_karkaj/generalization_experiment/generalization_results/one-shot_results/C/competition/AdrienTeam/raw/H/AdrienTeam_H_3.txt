Here is the code to generate the structure resembling "H" using the `ab_drop()` function:

```python
# Map initialization
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the first block horizontally to create the middle bar of "H"
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Drop the second block vertically to create the left bar of "H"
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Drop the third block vertically to create the right bar of "H"
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Drop the fourth block horizontally to create the top bar of "H"
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

Please note that the order and position of the `ab_drop()` calls are crucial to meet the constraints and create a stable structure resembling "H".
