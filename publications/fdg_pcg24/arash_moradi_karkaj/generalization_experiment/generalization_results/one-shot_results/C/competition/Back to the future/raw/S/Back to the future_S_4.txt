To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "S" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code: `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Drop the b31 block starting from slot 2 and centered at slot 9. This block will provide stability for the upper part of the structure. Use the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 9)`.

3. Drop the b31 block starting from slot 3 and centered at slot 7. This block will support the previously dropped block and maintain stability. Use the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 7)`.

4. Drop the b31 block starting from slot 4 and centered at slot 5. This block will support the previous blocks and maintain stability. Use the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 5)`.

5. Drop the b13 block starting from slot 4 and centered at slot 4. This block will create the bottom curve of the "S" shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b13', 4)`.

6. Drop the b13 block starting from slot 12 and centered at slot 6. This block will create the upper curve of the "S" shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b13', 6)`.

7. Drop the b31 block starting from slot 12 and centered at slot 9. This block will complete the middle part of the "S" shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 9)`.

8. Drop the b31 block starting from slot 13 and centered at slot 7. This block will support the previous blocks and maintain stability. Use the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 7)`.

9. Drop the b31 block starting from slot 14 and centered at slot 5. This block will support the previous blocks and maintain stability. Use the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 5)`.

10. Drop the b11 block starting from slot 14 and centered at slot 4. This block will create the bottom part of the "S" shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b11', 4)`.

11. Drop the b11 block starting from slot 15 and centered at slot 6. This block will create the upper part of the "S" shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b11', 6)`.

12. The structure is now complete and resembles the uppercase character "S".
