To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "U" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided map initialization function.
2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer (layer 0).
3. Drop a b31 block at the center slot (W//2) using the ab_drop function. This will act as the base of the "U" shape.
4. Check the stability of the structure after each drop using a stability check function. This function should check if the dropped block is supported by the lower structure or any previously dropped blocks.
5. If the drop is stable, continue building the structure. If not, adjust the drop position by moving the block one slot to the left or right until a stable drop position is found.
6. Drop a b13 block on top of the center slot of the b31 block to form the vertical part of the "U" shape.
7. Drop a b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with the center slot, to complete the horizontal part of the "U" shape.
8. Now, the bottom part of the "U" shape is complete.
9. Start building the upper part of the "U" shape by dropping a b13 block on top of the center slot of the top layer.
10. Continue building the upper part of the "U" shape by dropping a b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with the center slot.
11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 until the upper part of the "U" shape matches the desired height.
12. The structure should now resemble the uppercase character "U" and meet all the hard constraints.

Note: The stability check function will need to consider the support needed for each specific block type. For example, the b31 block should have support on both sides (slots y-1 and y+1), while the b13 block only needs support on the sides (slots y-1 and y+1) and not the center slot (y). Additionally, the stability check should also account for the stability of the entire structure, considering the weight and position of all previously dropped blocks.

Example implementation:

```
def stability_check(drop_pos, x):
    # Check if the dropped block at drop_pos is stable
    # Check if it has support on the sides based on the block type x
    
    # Check for support on the left side (slot y-1)
    if drop_pos[1] > 0:
        if structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]-1] != ' ':
            return True
    
    # Check for support on the right side (slot y+1)
    if drop_pos[1] < W-1:
        if structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]+1] != ' ':
            return True
    
    # Check for support underneath (slot y)
    if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
        return True
    
    return False


# Initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]


# Drop the base of the "U" shape
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
base_pos = (H-1, W//2)  # Store the position of the base


# Build the bottom part of the "U" shape
b13_pos = (base_pos[0]-1, base_pos[1])
ab_drop('b13', base_pos[1])
ab_drop('b31', base_pos[1])


# Build the top part of the "U" shape
top_pos = (b13_pos[0]-1, base_pos[1])
ab_drop('b13', base_pos[1])
ab_drop('b31', base_pos[1])

# Continue building the upper part of the "U" shape as needed

# Check if the final structure meets the desired shape and stability constraints
# Adjust the structure if needed

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This implementation provides a basic outline of how to use the `ab_drop()` function to generate a stable structure resembling the uppercase character "U". However, it is important to note that additional logic and adjustments may be required to meet the specific constraints and ensure the stability and shape of the structure.
