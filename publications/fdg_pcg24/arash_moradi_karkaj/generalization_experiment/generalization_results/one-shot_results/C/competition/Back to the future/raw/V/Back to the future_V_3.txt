To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "V" using the `ab_drop()` function, we will need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided `structure` variable.

2. Determine the drop positions for each block type to form the "V" shape. We will need to consider stability and ensure that each block is supported by the lower structure.

3. Call the `ab_drop()` function for each block type and drop them at the determined positions.

4. Repeat step 3 for all blocks in the desired "V" shape, making sure to check stability before each drop.

Here is an example implementation:

```python
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers

# Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Function to check stability at a given position
def is_stable(pos):
    if pos[0] == H-1 or structure[pos[0]+1][pos[1]] != ' ':
        return True
    return False

# Function to check if a block can be dropped at a position
def can_drop_block(pos):
    if pos[0] == 0 or (pos[0] > 0 and structure[pos[0]-1][pos[1]] != ' '):
        return True
    return False

# Drop a block at the given position and update the structure grid
def drop_block(block_type, pos):
    ab_drop(block_type, pos[1])  # Call ab_drop function
    structure[pos[0]][pos[1]] = block_type  # Update structure grid

# Drop the b31 block at the bottom of the "V" shape
b31_pos = (H-1, W//2)
while not is_stable(b31_pos) or not can_drop_block(b31_pos):
    b31_pos = (b31_pos[0] - 1, b31_pos[1])
drop_block('b31', b31_pos)

# Drop the b13 blocks to form the sides of the "V" shape
b13_pos_1 = (b31_pos[0] - 1, b31_pos[1] - 1)
while not is_stable(b13_pos_1) or not can_drop_block(b13_pos_1):
    b13_pos_1 = (b13_pos_1[0] - 1, b13_pos_1[1] - 1)
drop_block('b13', b13_pos_1)

b13_pos_2 = (b31_pos[0] - 1, b31_pos[1] + 1)
while not is_stable(b13_pos_2) or not can_drop_block(b13_pos_2):
    b13_pos_2 = (b13_pos_2[0] - 1, b13_pos_2[1] + 1)
drop_block('b13', b13_pos_2)

# Drop the b11 block at the top of the "V" shape
b11_pos = (b13_pos_1[0] - 1, b13_pos_1[1])
while not is_stable(b11_pos) or not can_drop_block(b11_pos):
    b11_pos = (b11_pos[0] - 1, b11_pos[1])
drop_block('b11', b11_pos)

# Display the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This implementation follows the steps mentioned above and uses the provided `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks at the determined positions. It ensures stability and meets the hard constraints while forming a structure similar to the uppercase character "V". The final structure is displayed by printing the contents of the `structure` grid.

It is important to note that the above implementation assumes that the `ab_drop()` function is correctly implemented and handles the dropping and placement of blocks according to the rules and constraints provided.
