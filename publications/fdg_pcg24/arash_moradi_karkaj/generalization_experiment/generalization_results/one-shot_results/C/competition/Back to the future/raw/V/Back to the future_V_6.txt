To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "V" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the base block (b31) at the bottom center of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```

3. Drop two vertical blocks (b13) on each side of the base block to form the arms of the "V":
```python
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 - 2)
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 + 2)
```

4. Drop a square block (b11) above the top of the arms to connect them:
```python
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
```

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each layer until reaching the top of the structure:
```python
for i in range(1, H - 1):
    if i % 2 == 1:
        ab_drop('b13', W // 2 - 2)
        ab_drop('b13', W // 2 + 2)
    else:
        ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
```

After completing these steps, the structure will resemble the uppercase character "V" and will meet the stability and boundary constraints. The specific coordinates of the ab_drop function calls may vary depending on the available slots and the desired positioning of the blocks, but the general approach should remain the same.
