To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "W" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is the algorithm to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code: `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Start by dropping the base of the "W" structure. To do this, call `ab_drop('b31', 9)` to drop a horizontal block at the center slot. This will provide a stable base for the structure.

3. Next, drop the two vertical blocks on top of the base to form the middle part of the "W". Call `ab_drop('b13', 7)` to drop a vertical block at slot 7, and then `ab_drop('b13', 11)` to drop another vertical block at slot 11. These blocks should be dropped in a way that they align with the base and provide stability.

4. Now, drop the uppermost part of the "W" by calling `ab_drop('b31', 5)` to drop a horizontal block at slot 5. This will complete the structure, with a stable base and two vertical blocks supporting the upper part.

5. At this point, the structure should resemble the uppercase letter "W". Make sure to check for stability after each drop to ensure the structure does not collapse.

6. You can add more variety to the generated structures by changing the slots at which the blocks are dropped. Experiment with different slot numbers while ensuring stability and the overall shape of the "W" structure.

Here is an example of how the `ab_drop()` function can be used to generate a stable "W" structure:

```python
W = 20
H = 16

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type, y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Drop the base of the "W" structure
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the vertical blocks for the middle part of the "W"
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 11)

# Drop the uppermost part of the "W"
ab_drop('b31', 5)

# Print the structure to visualize the "W"
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The output should be a stable structure that resembles the uppercase letter "W" formed by the dropped blocks.
