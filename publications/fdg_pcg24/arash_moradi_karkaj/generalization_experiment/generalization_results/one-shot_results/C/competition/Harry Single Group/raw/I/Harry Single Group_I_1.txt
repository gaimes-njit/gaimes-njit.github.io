To generate a structure resembling the letter "I", we can start by placing a b13 brick vertically at the bottom of the field to act as the base. It will occupy the cells (5, 0), (5, 1), and (5, 2). Then, we can place a b13 brick vertically on top of the previous brick, occupying the cells (5, 3), (5, 4), and (5, 5). 

To ensure stability, we need to make sure that the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot (the contact point between the two bricks) is the same. In this case, both sides have only one occupied cell, so the structure is stable.

Here's the code to generate the structure:

```python
# Map initialization
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Place the base b13 brick
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Place the upper b13 brick
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

This code initializes the field with zeros (representing empty cells) and then calls the `ab_drop()` function to place the bricks accordingly. We specify the type of the brick as 'b13' and the x_position as 5 (the pivot point). The function will automatically drop the bricks from the top of the field to the ground, ensuring stability and avoiding boundary collisions.
