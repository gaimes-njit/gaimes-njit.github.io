To form the shape resembling the letter "I" using the given bricks, we can start by initializing the field. Since the height of the letter "I" is 4 cells, we need to ensure that the field has enough height to accommodate it.

```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, we can start placing the bricks on the field using the ab_drop() function. To form the letter "I", we can use two b13 bricks stacked on top of each other and then place a b11 brick on top of them.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the first b13 brick
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the second b13 brick
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place the b11 brick on top
```

To ensure stability, we need to check if the bricks are stable after each placement. In this case, since we are stacking bricks vertically, stability is automatically guaranteed.

To avoid boundary collisions, we can check if the current position of the brick exceeds the boundaries of the field before each placement. If it does, we can adjust the x_position accordingly.

Here is the complete code:

```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    if x == 'b31':
        width = 3
        height = 1
    elif x == 'b13':
        width = 1
        height = 3
    elif x == 'b11':
        width = 1
        height = 1

    while y + width > 20:  # Adjust x_position if exceeding right boundary
        y -= 1

    while y < 0:  # Adjust x_position if exceeding left boundary
        y += 1

    for i in range(height):  # Check if any cells are occupied in the current position
        for j in range(width):
            if field[i][y+j] == 1:
                return

    for i in range(height):  # Place the brick on the field
        for j in range(width):
            field[i][y+j] = 1

ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the first b13 brick
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the second b13 brick
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place the b11 brick on top

for row in field:
    print(row)
```

The output will be:

```
