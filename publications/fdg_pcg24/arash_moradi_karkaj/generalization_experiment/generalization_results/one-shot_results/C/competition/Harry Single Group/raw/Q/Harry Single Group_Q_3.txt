To form the shape resembling the letter "Q", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() instructions:

1. Initialize the map:
```
map = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Drop b13 brick at x_position = 5:
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
This will occupy cells (5, 0), (5, 1), and (5, 2).

3. Drop b31 brick at x_position = 6:
```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```
This will occupy cells (5, 3), (6, 3), and (7, 3).

4. Drop b31 brick at x_position = 8:
```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```
This will occupy cells (7, 4), (8, 4), and (9, 4).

5. Drop b11 brick at x_position = 6:
```
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```
This will occupy cell (7, 5).

6. Drop b11 brick at x_position = 9:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
This will occupy cell (10, 5).

The final structure resembling the letter "Q" will occupy the following cells:
(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (7, 5), (10, 5).

Just make sure to execute each ab_drop() instruction one after the other in the correct sequence to form the desired shape.
