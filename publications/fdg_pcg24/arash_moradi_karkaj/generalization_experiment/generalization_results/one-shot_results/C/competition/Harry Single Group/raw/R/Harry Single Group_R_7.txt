To form a shape resembling the letter "R", we can use the b13 brick to create the vertical line and the b31 brick to create the horizontal line.

First, we initialize the map with all cells set to 0. Let's define a function called initialize_map() to do this:

```python
def initialize_map():
    map = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
    return map
```

Next, we can start generating the structure:

```python
def generate_structure():
    map = initialize_map()
    ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Generating the vertical line
    
    # Checking stability and avoiding boundary collisions
    if map[0][5] == 0:
        ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Generating the horizontal line
    elif map[0][6] == 0:
        ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Generating the horizontal line
    else:
        ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Generating the horizontal line
    
    # Printing the resulting structure
    for row in map:
        print(row)

generate_structure()
```

This will generate a structure resembling the letter "R" in the form of occupied cells in the map. Note that the exact shape of the letter "R" may vary depending on the placement of bricks and the specific conditions of stability and boundary collisions.

Remember to replace the `print(row)` statement with the appropriate code to display the map in your specific programming environment.
