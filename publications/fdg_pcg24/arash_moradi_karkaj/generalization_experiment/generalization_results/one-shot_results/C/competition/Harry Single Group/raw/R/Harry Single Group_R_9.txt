To generate the shape resembling the letter "R" using the available functions and props, we need to plan our moves and ensure stability and boundary collisions.

First, let's initialize the map with empty cells:

```
map = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, we will start by placing a b31 brick on the ground at x_position = 2:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will occupy the cells (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 0).

To maintain stability, we need to place a b13 brick vertically on top of the b31 brick. To achieve this, we will drop a b13 brick at x_position = 2:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

This will occupy the cells (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3).

Now, we have the first part of the letter "R" shape.

To complete the shape, we will place a b31 brick horizontally on top of the b13 brick. We can drop the b31 brick at x_position = 1:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This will occupy the cells (0, 3), (1, 3), and (2, 3).

Lastly, we need to add a small b11 brick to close the shape. We can drop the b11 brick at x_position = 2:

```
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

This will occupy the cell (2, 4).

Now, we have successfully generated the shape resembling the letter "R" using the available functions and props while ensuring stability and avoiding boundary collisions.
