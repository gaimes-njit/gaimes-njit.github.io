To generate the required structure resembling the letter "T" and satisfy the important notes, we need to strategically place the bricks using the ab_drop() function.

We can start by placing a b31 brick horizontally on the ground, with its middle cell at x_position 7. This will occupy the cells (6, 0), (7, 0), and (8, 0).

Next, we can place a b11 brick on top of the b31 brick, with its center aligned to the center cell of the b31 brick. This will occupy the cell (7, 1).

Finally, we can place a b13 brick vertically beside the b31 brick on the ground, with its rightmost cell aligned to the rightmost cell of the b31 brick. This will occupy the cells (9, 0), (9, 1), and (9, 2).

To achieve this, we can use the following code:

```
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the b31 brick horizontally on the ground
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Place the b11 brick on top of the b31 brick
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place the b13 brick vertically beside the b31 brick on the ground
```

After executing this code, the cells occupied by the bricks will form a shape resembling the letter "T" in the specified field while satisfying the important notes.
