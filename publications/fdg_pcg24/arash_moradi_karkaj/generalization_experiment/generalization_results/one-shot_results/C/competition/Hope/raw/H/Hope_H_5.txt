To create the structure of 'H' inside a 20*16 box using the ab_drop() command, you can follow these steps:

1. Drop two b13 blocks at x positions 5 and 15. This will create the vertical lines of the 'H'.
   - ab_drop('b13', 5)
   - ab_drop('b13', 15)

2. Drop a b31 block at x position 8. This will create the horizontal line of the 'H'.
   - ab_drop('b31', 8)

The resulting structure will look like the letter 'H' inside the 20*16 box:

```
               |
               |
               |
               |
    _______    |
               |
               |
               |
```

Note: '#' symbol represents empty space in the box.
