To generate the uppercase English letter "B", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 2

This will create a stable and accurate representation of the letter "B" within the allowed space boundaries.
