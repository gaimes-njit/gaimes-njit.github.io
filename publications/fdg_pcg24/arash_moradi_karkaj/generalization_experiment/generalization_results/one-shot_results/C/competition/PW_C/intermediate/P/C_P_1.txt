To generate the uppercase English letter "P", we need to create four blocks in the following formation:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 1 and 2: `ab_drop('b13', 1) ab_drop('b13', 2)`
3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

These commands will create the letter "P" within the specified environment and gravity rules.
