To generate the uppercase letter "A" using the given block types and environment, the following sequence of ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

Explanation of the sequence:
- The first two commands, `ab_drop('b13', 2)` and `ab_drop('b13', 1)`, create the two vertical lines on the left side of the letter "A".
- The third command, `ab_drop('b31', 2)`, creates the horizontal line in the middle of the letter "A".
- The next four commands, `ab_drop('b11', 1)`, `ab_drop('b11', 3)`, `ab_drop('b11', 2)`, and `ab_drop('b11', 4)`, create the four small squares on the top of the letter "A".

By following this sequence of commands, the uppercase letter "A" can be generated within the defined environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
