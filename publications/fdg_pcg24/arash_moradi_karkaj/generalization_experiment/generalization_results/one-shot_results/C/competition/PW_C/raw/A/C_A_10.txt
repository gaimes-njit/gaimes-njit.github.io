To generate the uppercase letter "A", we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width. This will serve as the foundation of the letter "A".

2. Next, place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the foundation. The first vertical block should be placed at position 1, and the second one at position 2.

3. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation, centered at position 2.

By following these steps, we would be able to generate the uppercase letter "A" within the defined grid and using the given block types.
