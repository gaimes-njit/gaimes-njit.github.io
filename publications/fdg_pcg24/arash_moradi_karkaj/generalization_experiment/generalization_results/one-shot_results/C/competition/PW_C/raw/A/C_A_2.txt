To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we can break it down into different components and build them one by one. Here is a sequence of ab_drop() commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)      # Create the foundation of the letter A
ab_drop('b31', 2)

ab_drop('b13', 1)      # Build the left vertical line of the letter A
ab_drop('b13', 1)

ab_drop('b13', 2)      # Build the middle vertical line of the letter A
ab_drop('b13', 2)

ab_drop('b13', 3)      # Build the right vertical line of the letter A
ab_drop('b13', 3)

ab_drop('b31', 2)      # Create the horizontal bar of the letter A
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "A" within the allowed space boundaries.
