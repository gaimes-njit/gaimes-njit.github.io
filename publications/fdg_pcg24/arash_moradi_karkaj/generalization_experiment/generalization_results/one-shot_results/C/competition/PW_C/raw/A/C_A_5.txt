To generate the uppercase letter "A", we can break it down into three parts: the left vertical line, the diagonal line, and the right vertical line. Here's how we can achieve this using the ab_drop() commands:

1. Start by placing the left vertical line using two vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Next, place the diagonal line using a horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

3. Finally, complete the letter by placing the right vertical line using two vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Combine all the commands together and you'll get the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "A":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
