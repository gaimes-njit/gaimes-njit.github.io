To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`.
2. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2, to the left of the foundation: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`, `ab_drop('b13', 2)`.
3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, above the vertical blocks: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.

The complete set of commands to generate the letter "A" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
