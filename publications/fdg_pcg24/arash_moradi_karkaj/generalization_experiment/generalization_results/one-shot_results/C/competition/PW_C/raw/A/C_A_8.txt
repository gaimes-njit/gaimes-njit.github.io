To construct the uppercase English letter "A", we can follow the steps below:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) to the left of the foundation:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Overall, the sequence of commands to generate the letter "A" would be as follows:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
