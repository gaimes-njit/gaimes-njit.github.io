To generate uppercase English letter "A", we can follow the below steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) next to the previous block at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the vertical blocks at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

Overall, the stream of commands to generate letter "A" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
