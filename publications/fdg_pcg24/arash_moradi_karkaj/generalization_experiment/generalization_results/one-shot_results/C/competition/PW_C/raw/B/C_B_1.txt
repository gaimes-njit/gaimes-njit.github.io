To generate the uppercase letter "B", we will need to strategically place the block types in the defined environment. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "B":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1) 
ab_drop('b13', 2) 
ab_drop('b31', 2) 
ab_drop('b13', 1) 
ab_drop('b13', 2) 
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to form the bottom part of the letter "B".
- Then, we place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 to form the left side of the letter "B".
- Next, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at positions 1 and 2 to form the top part of the letter "B".
- Finally, we repeat the placement of the two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 to complete the right side of the letter "B".

By following these commands, the blocks will stack on top of each other according to the 2D gravity rules, resulting in the uppercase letter "B" within the allowed space boundaries.
