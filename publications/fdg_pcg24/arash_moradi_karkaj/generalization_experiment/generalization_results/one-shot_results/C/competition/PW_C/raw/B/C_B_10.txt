To generate the uppercase letter "B", we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:
- First, we drop a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, which will serve as the base of the letter "B".
- Next, we drop two vertical straight blocks (b13) at position 1 to create the left upright part of the letter.
- Then, we drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to complete the top part of the letter.
- Finally, we drop two vertical straight blocks (b13) at position 4 to create the right upright part of the letter.

By following this sequence of commands, we can generate the uppercase letter "B" within the allowed space and maintaining structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
