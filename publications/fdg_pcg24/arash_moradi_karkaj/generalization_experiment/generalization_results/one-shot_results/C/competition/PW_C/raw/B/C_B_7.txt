To generate the uppercase letter "B", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Explanation:
- First, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to create the foundation of the letter.
- Then, place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 to the left of the foundation.
- Next, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to complete the top part of the letter.
- Finally, place four vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 to create the bottom part of the letter.
