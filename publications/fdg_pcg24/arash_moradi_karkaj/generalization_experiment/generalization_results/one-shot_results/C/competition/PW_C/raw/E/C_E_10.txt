To generate the uppercase English letter "E", follow the instructions below:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) to the left of the previous block at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) to the left of the previous block at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous blocks at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

The stream of commands to generate the letter "E" would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
