To generate the capital letter "E", you can use the ab_drop() commands in the following sequence:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Create the horizontal foundation
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Create the vertical bar on the left
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Create the second vertical bar on the left
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Create the horizontal bar at the top
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Create the vertical bar in the center
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Create the second vertical bar in the center
```

Make sure to follow the gravity rules and stack the blocks one by one in the given order.
