To create the uppercase letter "E" using the given block types and environment, we can follow the following steps:

1. Place the foundation of the letter by using the "b31" block type. Place it at position 2 along the width. 
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

2. Place two vertical blocks on the left side of the foundation. Use the "b13" block type for this. Place the first block at position 1 and the second block at position 2.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. Finally, for the top part of the letter, place another "b31" block on top of the foundation at position 2.
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

By following these steps, we will have successfully created the uppercase letter "E" using the available block types in the given environment.
