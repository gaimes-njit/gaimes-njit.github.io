To generate the uppercase English letter "E", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 along the width.
2. We then place three 1x1 square blocks (b11) on top of the horizontal block, effectively creating the vertical line of the letter "E".
3. Next, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width to complete the middle bar of the letter "E".
4. Finally, we repeat the process of placing three 1x1 square blocks (b11) on top of the second horizontal block to create the bottom line of the letter "E".

By following these commands, we can generate the uppercase letter "E" within the specified environment while maintaining stacking and stability.
