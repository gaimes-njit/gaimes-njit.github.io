The solution to generate uppercase English letter "F" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. The foundation for the letter "F" is created by using a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 (ab_drop('b31', 2)).
2. Two vertical straight blocks (b13) are placed on the left side of the foundation to form the lower part of the letter (ab_drop('b13', 1) and ab_drop('b13', 2)).
3. Another horizontal straight block is placed on top of the foundation to form the upper part of the letter (ab_drop('b31', 2)).
4. Finally, a vertical straight block is placed on the left side of the upper part to complete the letter (ab_drop('b13', 1)).
5. The last command (ab_drop('b31', 2)) is not necessary for the formation of the letter "F", but it helps to stabilize the structure and follow the gravity rules.
