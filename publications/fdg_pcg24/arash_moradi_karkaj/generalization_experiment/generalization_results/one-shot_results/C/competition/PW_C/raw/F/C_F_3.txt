To create the uppercase English letter "F" using the given block types and commands, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 using the command ab_drop('b31', 2).

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, and another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 using the commands ab_drop('b13', 1) and ab_drop('b13', 2).

3. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 using the command ab_drop('b31', 2).

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to create the letter "F" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
