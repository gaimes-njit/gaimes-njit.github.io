To create the uppercase letter "F", we will follow these steps:

1. Place the foundation of the letter by dropping a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Add the vertical bar on the left side of the letter by dropping two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Complete the top part of the letter by dropping another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "F" is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
