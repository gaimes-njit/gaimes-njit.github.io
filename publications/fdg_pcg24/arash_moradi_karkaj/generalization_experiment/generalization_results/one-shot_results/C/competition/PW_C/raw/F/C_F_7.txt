To generate the letter "F" using the given block types, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation:
1. `ab_drop('b31',1)` - We start by placing a horizontal straight block in the first position ('b31',1) to form the top horizontal line of the letter "F".
2. `ab_drop('b13',1)` - Next, we place a vertical straight block in the first position ('b13',1) to form the left vertical line of the letter "F".
3. `ab_drop('b13',2)` - We then place another vertical straight block in the second position ('b13',2) to extend the left vertical line downwards.
4. `ab_drop('b31',1)` - Finally, we place another horizontal straight block in the first position ('b31',1) to form the bottom horizontal line of the letter "F".

By following these commands in order, we can accurately generate the uppercase English letter "F" within the specified boundaries of the environment.
