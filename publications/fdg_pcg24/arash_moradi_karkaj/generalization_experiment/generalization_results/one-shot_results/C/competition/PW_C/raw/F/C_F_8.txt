To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Let's break down the commands step by step:

1. `ab_drop('b31', 1)`: This command places a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1 along the width. This will be the vertical stroke of the letter "F".

2. `ab_drop('b13', 1)`: This command places a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 1 along the width. This creates the top left corner of the letter "F".

3. `ab_drop('b13', 1)`: This command places another vertical straight block of height 3 at position 1 along the width. This completes the top part of the letter "F".

4. `ab_drop('b31', 2)`: This command places another horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 2 along the width. This creates the bottom horizontal stroke of the letter "F".

By executing these commands in the given environment, we will be able to generate the uppercase English letter "F" accurately and maintain structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
