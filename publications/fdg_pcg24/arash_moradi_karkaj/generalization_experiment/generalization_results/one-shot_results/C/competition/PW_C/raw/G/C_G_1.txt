To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can break it down into different segments and use the block types to construct each segment one by one. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Create the foundation for the letter "G" by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Add the vertical bar on the left side of the foundation by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Create the top part of the letter "G" by placing another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "G" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
