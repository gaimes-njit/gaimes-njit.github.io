To generate the uppercase letter "G", we can break it down into three main parts: the top horizontal bar, the vertical bar on the left, and the bottom horizontal bar.

To create the top horizontal bar, we can use the block type "b31". We need to place two of these blocks consecutively at position 2 along the width. The commands to create the top bar are as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Next, we move on to the vertical bar on the left. For this, we can use the block type "b13". We need two of these blocks, positioned at 1 along the width, consecutively at different heights. The commands to create the vertical bar are as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Finally, we create the bottom horizontal bar. Again, we can use the block type "b31" for this. We need to place two of these blocks consecutively at position 2 along the width, just like the top bar. The commands to create the bottom bar are as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Putting it all together, the complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "G" is:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```
