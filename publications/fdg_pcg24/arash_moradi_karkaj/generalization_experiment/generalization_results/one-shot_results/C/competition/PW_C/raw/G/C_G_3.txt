To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can start by creating the vertical bar using two vertical straight blocks (b13) placed next to each other. Then, we can add the horizontal line using a horizontal straight block (b31) placed on top of the vertical bar. Finally, we can add the curved line using a combination of square blocks (b11) and horizontal straight blocks (b31).

Here are the ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "G":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the left vertical bar
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Place the right vertical bar
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place the horizontal line
ab_drop('b11', 3)  // Place the first square block of the curved line
ab_drop('b31', 3)  // Place the first horizontal straight block of the curved line
ab_drop('b11', 4)  // Place the second square block of the curved line
ab_drop('b31', 4)  // Place the second horizontal straight block of the curved line
ab_drop('b11', 5)  // Place the third square block of the curved line
ab_drop('b31', 5)  // Place the third horizontal straight block of the curved line
ab_drop('b11', 6)  // Place the fourth square block of the curved line
ab_drop('b31', 6)  // Place the fourth horizontal straight block of the curved line
ab_drop('b11', 7)  // Place the fifth square block of the curved line
ab_drop('b31', 7)  // Place the fifth horizontal straight block of the curved line
ab_drop('b11', 8)  // Place the sixth square block of the curved line
ab_drop('b31', 8)  // Place the sixth horizontal straight block of the curved line
ab_drop('b11', 9)  // Place the seventh square block of the curved line
ab_drop('b31', 9)  // Place the seventh horizontal straight block of the curved line
ab_drop('b11', 10) // Place the eighth square block of the curved line
ab_drop('b31', 10) // Place the eighth horizontal straight block of the curved line
ab_drop('b11', 11) // Place the ninth square block of the curved line
ab_drop('b31', 11) // Place the ninth horizontal straight block of the curved line
ab_drop('b11', 12) // Place the tenth square block of the curved line
ab_drop('b31', 12) // Place the tenth horizontal straight block of the curved line
ab_drop('b11', 13) // Place the eleventh square block of the curved line
```

By following these commands, you will be able to generate the uppercase letter "G" within the given environment and rules.
