To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the foundation for the letter "G" using a horizontal straight block (b31) starting at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the foundation, starting at positions 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation to complete the top part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The final set of commands to generate the letter "G" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
