To generate uppercase English letter "G" using the ab_drop() command and block types b11, b31, and b13, follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block b31 at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`. This will form the base of the letter.

2. Place a vertical straight block b13 to the left of the base at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`. This will form the vertical part of the letter on the left side.

3. Place another vertical straight block b13 to the left of the base at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`. This will extend the vertical part of the letter on the left side.

4. Finally, complete the top part of the letter by placing another horizontal straight block b31 at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.

The complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "G" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
