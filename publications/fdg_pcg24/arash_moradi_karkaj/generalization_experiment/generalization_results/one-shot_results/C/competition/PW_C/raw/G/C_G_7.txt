To generate the uppercase English letter "G," you can use the following stream of commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1,1).
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position (1,1) to form the left side of the letter "G."
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position (2,1) to complete the left side of the letter "G."
4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (2,1) to form the top part of the letter "G."
5. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position (2,2) to create the middle part of the letter "G."
6. Place two more 1x1 square blocks (b11) at positions (2,3) and (2,4) to complete the middle part of the letter "G."
7. Finally, place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) at positions (3,1) and (3,2) to form the bottom part of the letter "G."

In the end, the stream of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "G" within the defined environment of the grid.
