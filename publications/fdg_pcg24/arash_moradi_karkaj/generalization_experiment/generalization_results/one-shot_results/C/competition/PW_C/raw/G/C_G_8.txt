To generate the uppercase English letter "G" using the given block types and environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`. This will serve as the foundation for the letter.

2. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) to the left of the foundation, at positions 1 and 2: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`, `ab_drop('b13', 2)`.

3. To create the top part of the letter, place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation, at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.

Combining all the commands, the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "G" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
