To generate the uppercase letter "H", we can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block "b31" at position (2,1).
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

2. Place a vertical straight block "b13" at positions (1,2) and (1,3) to form the left vertical column of the letter.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

3. Place a vertical straight block "b13" at positions (4,2) and (4,3) to form the right vertical column of the letter.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 4)
   ab_drop('b13', 4)
   ```

4. Place a horizontal straight block "b31" at position (2,4) to form the top horizontal line of the letter.
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "H" will be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
