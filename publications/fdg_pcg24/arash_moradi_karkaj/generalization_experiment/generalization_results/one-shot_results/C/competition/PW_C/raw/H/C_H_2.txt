To create the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types and environment, the following stream of commands should be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)    // Place the horizontal block as the foundation
ab_drop('b13', 1)    // Place the left vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 3)    // Place the right vertical block
ab_drop('b31', 1)    // Place the top horizontal block
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "H" by stacking the blocks in the specified positions within the allowed space boundaries.
