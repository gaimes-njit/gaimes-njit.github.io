To generate the uppercase English letter "H" in the defined environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
- Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, creating the first vertical stem of the "H".
- Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, extending the vertical stem.
- Add one more horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3, completing the vertical stem.
- Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, forming the crossbar of the "H".
- Add another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3, extending the crossbar.
- Finally, create the top part of the "H" by placing three horizontal straight blocks (b31) at positions 1, 2, and 3.

After executing these commands, you should have a stable representation of the uppercase letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries.
