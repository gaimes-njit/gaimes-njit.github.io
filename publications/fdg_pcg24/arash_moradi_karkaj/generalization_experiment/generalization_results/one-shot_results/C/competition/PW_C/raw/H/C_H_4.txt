To generate the uppercase English letter "H", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
- First, we create the foundation of the letter by placing three horizontal straight blocks (`b31`) in a row starting from position 1.
- Then, we place three vertical straight blocks (`b13`) on top of the middle block in the foundation to create the vertical lines of the letter.
- Finally, we repeat the vertical block placement two more times in the same position to complete the vertical lines of the letter.

This stream of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries and following the gravity rules.
