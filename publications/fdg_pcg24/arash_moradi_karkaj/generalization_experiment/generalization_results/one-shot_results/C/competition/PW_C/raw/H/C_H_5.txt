To generate the uppercase English letter "H", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1,1).
- Next, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position (2,2) and another vertical straight block (b13) at position (2,3), creating the left part of the "H".
- Then, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position (4,4) to create the middle part of the "H".
- After that, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position (6,6) to create the right part of the "H".
- Finally, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position (8,8) to complete the top part of the "H".

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries.
