To generate the uppercase English letter "H" using the provided block types and environment, the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands can be used:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31',1)   // Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1)   // Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)   // Place another vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',4)   // Place another horizontal straight block at position 4
```

This sequence of commands will generate the letter "H" in the defined environment, with the blocks accurately represented and fitting within the allowed space boundaries.
