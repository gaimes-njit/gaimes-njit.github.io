To generate the uppercase letter "H", we can break it down into three parts: the two vertical bars on the sides and the horizontal bar in the middle.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "H":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical bar on the left
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical bar on the left
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal bar in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 13)  # Place the third vertical bar on the right
ab_drop('b13', 14)  # Place the fourth vertical bar on the right
ab_drop('b31', 13)  # Place the fifth horizontal bar in the middle
```

The result will be the uppercase letter "H" formed by the vertical bars on the sides and the horizontal bar in the middle.
