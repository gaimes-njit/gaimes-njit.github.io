To generate the uppercase letter "H" in the given environment, we need to construct the letter using the provided block types in a way that ensures stability with respect to the gravity rules. 

Here is a stream of ab_drop() commands that can be used to generate the letter "H":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block of width 3 and height 1 at X position 1, serving as the foundation for the letter.
2. The second and third commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)` and `ab_drop('b13', 2)` place two vertical straight blocks of width 1 and height 3 to the left of the foundation, forming the vertical bars of the letter "H".
3. The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places another horizontal straight block of width 3 and height 1 just above the vertical bars, connecting them and completing the top part of the letter.
4. The fifth command `ab_drop('b31', 3)` places a final horizontal straight block of width 3 and height 1 at the top right corner, providing stability to the structure and completing the letter "H".

Please note that the commands should be executed in consecutive order for the desired result.
