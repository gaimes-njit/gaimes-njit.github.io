To generate the uppercase English letter "I", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:

- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` creates the foundation for the letter "I", which is a horizontal straight block starting at position 1.
- The second and third commands `ab_drop('b13', 2)` create the vertical straight blocks on the left side of the foundation.
- The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` extends the foundation to the right.
- The fifth command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` further extends the foundation to the right.

This sequence of commands will create the letter "I" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and staying within the boundaries of the allowed space.
