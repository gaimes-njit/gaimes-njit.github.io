To generate the uppercase English letter "I", we can use the following stream of commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. `ab_drop('b31', 2)`: This command places a horizontal straight block of width 3 units at position 2 (starting from the left side).
2. `ab_drop('b11', 1)`: This command places a square block of size 1x1 at position 1, creating the bottom part of the letter "I".
3. `ab_drop('b13', 2)`: This command places a vertical straight block of width 1 unit and height 3 units at position 2, creating the top part of the letter "I".

The combination of these commands will create the uppercase English letter "I" within the boundaries of the allowed space.
