To generate the uppercase letter "I", we can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: ab_drop('b31', 2)

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 and position 2, to the left of the horizontal block: ab_drop('b13', 1) ab_drop('b13', 2)

3. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, on top of the previous blocks: ab_drop('b31', 2)

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the letter "I" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
