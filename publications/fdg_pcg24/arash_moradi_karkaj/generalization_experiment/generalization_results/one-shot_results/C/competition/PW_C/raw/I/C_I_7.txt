To generate the uppercase English letter "I", we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal straight block on top of the vertical blocks at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "I" in the defined environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
