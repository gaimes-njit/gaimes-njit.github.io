To generate the uppercase letter "I" using the given block types in the defined environment, you can follow the following series of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal straight block as the foundation
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the vertical straight block on top of the foundation
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place another vertical straight block on top of the previous block
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place one more vertical straight block on top of the previous blocks
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place another horizontal straight block on top of the vertical blocks
```

Please note that the numbering (1-19) for the width index starts from the left side of the allowed space.
