To generate the uppercase letter "J" using the ab_drop() commands and the given block types, the following commands can be used:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands creates a vertical line on the left side using the 'b13' block and then stacks four 'b31' blocks horizontally on top of it, forming the letter "J" within the allowed space boundaries.
