To generate the uppercase letter "J", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2) # Drop a vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2) # Drop a vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2) # Drop a horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3) # Drop a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4) # Drop a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5) # Drop a square block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 6) # Drop a square block at position 6
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "J" in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
