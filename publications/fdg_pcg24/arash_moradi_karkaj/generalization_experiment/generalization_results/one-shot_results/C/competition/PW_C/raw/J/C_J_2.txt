To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 2 to form the base of the letter.
- Then, we place four vertical straight blocks (`b13`) starting from position 1 to position 4 to form the vertical line of the letter.

These commands will generate the uppercase letter "J" within the allowed space and following the gravity rules.
