This will create a vertical straight block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units.

Step 2: Create the foundation of the letter using a horizontal straight block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
This will create a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit. Place it at position 2.

Step 3: Create the top part of the letter using another horizontal straight block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
This will create another horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit. Place it at position 2.

By following these steps, you should be able to generate the uppercase letter "J" using the given block types and commands.
