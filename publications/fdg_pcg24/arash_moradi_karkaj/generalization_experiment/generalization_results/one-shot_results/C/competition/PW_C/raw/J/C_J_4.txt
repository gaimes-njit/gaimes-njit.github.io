To generate the uppercase letter "J", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

Explanation:

1. `ab_drop('b31',2)` - This command places a horizontal straight block at position 2 along the width, creating the foundation for the letter "J".

2. `ab_drop('b13',1)` - This command places a vertical straight block at position 1 along the width, forming the left vertical line of the letter "J".

3. `ab_drop('b13',1)` - This command places another vertical straight block at position 1 along the width, extending the left vertical line of the letter "J".

4. `ab_drop('b13',1)` - This command places another vertical straight block at position 1 along the width, completing the left vertical line of the letter "J".

5. `ab_drop('b13',2)` - This command places another vertical straight block at position 2 along the width, forming the horizontal line of the letter "J".

By following these commands, you can create the uppercase letter "J" using the given block types and within the defined environment.
