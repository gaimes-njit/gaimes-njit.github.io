To generate the uppercase English letter J, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)     # Place the horizontal block at the bottom-left corner
ab_drop('b13', 1)     # Place the vertical block to the left of the horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 2)     # Place another vertical block to the left of the first vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 3)     # Place another vertical block to the left of the second vertical block
ab_drop('b31', 2)     # Place a horizontal block on top of the vertical blocks, centered in the middle
```

This sequence of commands should create a stable and accurately represented uppercase English letter J within the allowed space boundaries.
