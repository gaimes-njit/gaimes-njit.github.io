To generate the uppercase letter "J", we can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`. This will be the base of the letter.
2. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1 and 2: `ab_drop('b13', 1) ab_drop('b13', 2)`. These blocks will form the vertical part of the letter.
3. Place another horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`. This will complete the top part of the letter.

The stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "J" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
