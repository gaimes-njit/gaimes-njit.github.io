To generate the uppercase letter "K" in the defined environment using the given block types, you would need to follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block of width 3 units (b31) at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block of height 3 units (b13) to the left of the previous block at position 1 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block of height 3 units (b13) to the left of the previous block at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block of width 3 units (b31) on top of the previous blocks at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

By following these steps, you will generate the uppercase letter "K" in the Tetris-like environment.

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "K" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```
