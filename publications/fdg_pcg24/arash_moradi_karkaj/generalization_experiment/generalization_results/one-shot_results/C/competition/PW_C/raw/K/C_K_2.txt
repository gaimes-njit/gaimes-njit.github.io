To generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) to the left of the previous block, at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) to the left of the previous block, at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`

4. For the top part of the letter, repeat step 1 by placing another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

Following these steps will generate the uppercase English letter "K" in the Tetris-like environment. The complete stream of commands would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
