```ab_drop('b31',1)```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) to the left of the previous block at position 1: 
```ab_drop('b13',1)```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) to the left of the previous block at position 2: 
```ab_drop('b13',2)```

4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previously placed blocks at position 2:
