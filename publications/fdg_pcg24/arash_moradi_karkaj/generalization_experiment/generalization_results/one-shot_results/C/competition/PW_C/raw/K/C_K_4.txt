To generate the uppercase English letter "K", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 units (b31) at position 1 along the width.
2. Place a vertical straight block of height 3 units (b13) at position 1 along the width.
3. Place another horizontal straight block of width 3 units (b31) at position 2 along the width.
4. Place another vertical straight block of height 3 units (b13) at position 2 along the width.
5. Finally, place another horizontal straight block of width 3 units (b31) at position 3 along the width.

These commands will generate the uppercase letter "K" using the given block types in the defined environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
