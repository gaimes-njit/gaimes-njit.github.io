To generate the uppercase letter "K", we will break it down into the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
This will serve as the foundation for the letter.

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1, followed by another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 2, to the left of the foundation:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
This will create the left leg of the letter "K".

3. Finally, to complete the top part of the letter, place another horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "K" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
