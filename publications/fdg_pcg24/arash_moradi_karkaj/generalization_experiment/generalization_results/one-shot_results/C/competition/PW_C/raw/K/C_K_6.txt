To generate the uppercase letter "K" using the mentioned command and Block Types, you can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) as the foundation at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

2. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) to the left of the foundation. Start from the top and go down:

   a. Place the first vertical block at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
   
   b. Place the second vertical block at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`

3. For the top part of the letter, place a horizontal straight block (b31) above the foundation at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the letter "K" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
