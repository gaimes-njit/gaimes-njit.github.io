To generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

Explanation:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Then, place a vertical straight block (b13) beside the horizontal block at position 1.
3. Next, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4.
4. Place another vertical straight block (b13) beside the horizontal block at position 4.
5. Repeat the same process for the remaining letters: place a horizontal straight block (b31) followed by a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 7, 9, and 11.

By following these commands, the blocks will stack on top of each other, forming the uppercase letter "K" within the allowed space boundaries.
