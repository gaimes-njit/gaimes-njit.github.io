To generate the uppercase English letter "L", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. Place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) at position 1.
2. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at position 4.
3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
4. Place three horizontal straight blocks (b31) at position 1.

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "L" within the allowed space boundaries and ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
