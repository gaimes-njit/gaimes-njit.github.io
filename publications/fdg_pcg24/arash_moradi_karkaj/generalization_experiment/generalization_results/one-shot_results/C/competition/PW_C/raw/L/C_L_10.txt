To generate the uppercase English letter "L", you can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
- Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 in the grid.
- Then, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, creating the base of the letter.
- Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, extending the base upwards.
- Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, completing the letter "L".
