To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place another vertical block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create the desired shape of the uppercase letter "L" within the allowed space boundaries.
