To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) as the foundation. Place it at position 2 using the command ab_drop('b31', 2).

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, we need to add two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the foundation. Place the first vertical block at position 1 using the command ab_drop('b13', 1), and then place the second vertical block at position 2 using the command ab_drop('b13', 2).

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Finally, we can add another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation to complete the letter. Place it at position 2 using the command ab_drop('b31', 2).

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "L" is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
