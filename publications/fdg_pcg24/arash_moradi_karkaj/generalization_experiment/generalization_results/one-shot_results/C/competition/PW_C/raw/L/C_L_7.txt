To generate the uppercase letter "L" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the vertical part of the letter. Place two vertical blocks at positions (1,2) and (1,3) using the `ab_drop('b13',1)` and `ab_drop('b13',2)` commands.

2. Next, create the horizontal part of the letter. Place a horizontal block at position (2,2) using the `ab_drop('b31',2)` command.

The final set of commands to generate the letter "L" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```
