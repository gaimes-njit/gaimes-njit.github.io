To generate the uppercase letter "L", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1 along the width.
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places a vertical straight block at position 1 along the width.
3. The third command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block at position 2 along the width, right next to the previous block.
4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b13', 3)` places yet another vertical straight block at position 3 along the width, completing the letter "L" shape.

By following these commands, we can generate the uppercase letter "L" with the given block types and within the allowed space boundaries.
