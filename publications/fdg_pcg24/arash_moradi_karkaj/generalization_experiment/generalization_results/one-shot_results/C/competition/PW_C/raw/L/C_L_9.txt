To create the uppercase letter "L", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal block of width 3 at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place a vertical block of height 3 at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place another vertical block of height 3 at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place another horizontal block of width 3 at position 2
```

This will create an "L" shape using the provided block types and following the gravity rules.
