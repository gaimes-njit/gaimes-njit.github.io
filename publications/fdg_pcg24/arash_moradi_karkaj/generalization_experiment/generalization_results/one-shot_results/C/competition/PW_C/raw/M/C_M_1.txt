To generate the uppercase letter "M", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing a 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 1.
2. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2 as the foundation of the letter.
3. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 on the left side of the foundation.
4. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2 next to the previous one.
5. Add another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3 to complete the left side of the letter.
6. Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 4 to connect the left and right sides.
7. Place a 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 5 to bridge the gap between the left and right sides.
8. Add another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 6 to complete the right side of the letter.
9. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3 on the right side of the letter.
10. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 4 next to the previous one.
11. Finally, place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 7 to complete the letter "M".

By following these commands, you will generate a stable and accurate representation of the uppercase English letter "M" in the defined grid environment.
