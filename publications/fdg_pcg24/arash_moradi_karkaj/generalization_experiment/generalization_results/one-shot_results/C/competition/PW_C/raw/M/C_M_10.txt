To generate the uppercase letter "M", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

This will create the letter "M" in the specified environment. 

Explanation of commands:
- The first two commands (`ab_drop('b13', 1)` and `ab_drop('b13', 2)`) create the left diagonal of the "M".
- The third command (`ab_drop('b31', 3)`) creates the middle vertical line of the "M".
- The fourth and fifth commands (`ab_drop('b13', 5)` and `ab_drop('b13', 6)`) create the right diagonal of the "M".

Note: The command `ab_drop(x, y)` places the block of type `x` at position `y` along the width. The block types `b13` and `b31` are used to create the required shapes for the letter "M" as described in the prompt.
