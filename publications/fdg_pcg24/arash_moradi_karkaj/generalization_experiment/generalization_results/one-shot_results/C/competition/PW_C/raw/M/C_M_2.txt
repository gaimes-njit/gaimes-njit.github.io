To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can break it down into three parts: the left diagonal, the middle vertical line, and the right diagonal.

To create the left diagonal, we can start by placing a b13 block at position (1, 1) and then another b13 block at position (1, 2). This will create a vertical line on the left side.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Next, we need to create the middle vertical line. We can do this by placing a b13 block at position (1, 3), followed by another b13 block at position (1, 4).

```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Finally, we need to create the right diagonal. We can do this by placing a b13 block at position (1, 5) and then another b13 block at position (1, 6). This will create a vertical line on the right side.

```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "M" is:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```
