To create the letter "M" in the given environment, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical block on left side
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place horizontal block as the foundation
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place vertical block on right side
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place vertical block on right side
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place horizontal block on top
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place vertical block on right side
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place vertical block on right side
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "M" in the Tetris-like environment.
