To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` creates the left vertical line of the letter "N".
- Then, the next three commands `ab_drop('b13', 2)`, `ab_drop('b13', 3)`, and `ab_drop('b31', 3)` create the diagonal line of the letter "N".
- Finally, the last two commands `ab_drop('b13', 4)` and `ab_drop('b13', 5)` create the right vertical line of the letter "N".

By executing these commands in order, the letter "N" will be accurately represented and fit within the allowed space boundaries.
