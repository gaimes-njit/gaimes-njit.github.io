To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) as the foundation at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) to the left of the foundation at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) to the left of the previous block at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The complete sequence of commands to generate the letter "N" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
