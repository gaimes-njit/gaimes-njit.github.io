To create the uppercase letter "N" using the given block types and command, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:  
   `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

2. Next, we need to place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the foundation block. Place the first vertical block at position 1:  
   `ab_drop('b13', 1)`

3. Place the second vertical block at position 2:  
   `ab_drop('b13', 2)`

4. Finally, add another horizontal straight block on top of the foundation block at position 2:  
   `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

The complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "N" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
