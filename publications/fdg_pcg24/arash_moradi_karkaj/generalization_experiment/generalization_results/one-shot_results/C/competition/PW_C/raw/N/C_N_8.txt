To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can break it down into three parts: the left vertical line, the diagonal middle line, and the right vertical line. 

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to construct the letter "N":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation of the commands:
1. Place two vertical blocks (b13) on the left side of the grid starting from position 1.
2. Place two horizontal blocks (b31) on top of the vertical blocks, starting from position 1.
3. Place two vertical blocks (b13) on the right side of the grid starting from position 2.

By following these commands, you will be able to generate the uppercase English letter "N" within the specified boundaries and gravity rules.
