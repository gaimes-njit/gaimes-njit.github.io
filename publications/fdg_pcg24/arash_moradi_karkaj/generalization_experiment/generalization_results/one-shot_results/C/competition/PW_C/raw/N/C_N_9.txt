To create the uppercase letter "N" using the given block types and environment, the following ab_drop() commands are needed:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

Explanation:
1. The first two commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)` and `ab_drop('b13', 2)` create a vertical straight block on the left side of the letter.
2. The third command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` creates the horizontal straight block in the middle of the letter.
3. The fourth and fifth commands `ab_drop('b13', 4)` and `ab_drop('b13', 5)` create another vertical straight block on the right side of the letter.
4. Lastly, the sixth command `ab_drop('b31', 5)` creates the horizontal straight block at the top of the letter.
