To generate the letter "O" using the given block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

2. Next, place two vertical straight blocks (b13) to the left of the foundation. Start from the top and work your way down:

   - Place the first vertical block at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
   - Place the second vertical block below the first one, at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`

3. Finally, complete the top part of the letter by placing another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "O" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
