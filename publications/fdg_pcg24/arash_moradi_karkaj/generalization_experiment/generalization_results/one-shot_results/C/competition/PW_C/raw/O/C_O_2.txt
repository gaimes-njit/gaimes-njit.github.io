To generate the uppercase letter "O" using the provided block types and environment, the following stream of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Create foundation at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place vertical block to the left of the foundation
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place another vertical block to the left of the first one
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place horizontal block at the top
```

These commands will stack the blocks in the required order and position to form the letter "O" within the defined environment.
