To generate the uppercase English letter "O", we will need to create a foundation using a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2. Then, we will add two vertical straight blocks (b13) to the left and right of the foundation. Finally, we will add another horizontal straight block (b31) on top to complete the letter.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "O":

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
