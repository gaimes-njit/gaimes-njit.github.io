To generate the uppercase English letter "O", we can start by creating the foundation using a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 (ab_drop('b31', 2)). This will form the base of the letter.

Next, we need to create the two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the foundation. We can do this by placing the first vertical block at position 1 (ab_drop('b13', 1)) and the second vertical block at position 2 (ab_drop('b13', 2)).

Finally, to complete the top part of the letter, we can add another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 (ab_drop('b31', 2)).

Here is the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "O":

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
