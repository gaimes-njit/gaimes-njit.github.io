To generate the uppercase letter "O" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to serve as the foundation:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the foundation to form the curves:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation to complete the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "O" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
