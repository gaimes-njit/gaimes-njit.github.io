To generate the uppercase letter "O", we need to create a circular shape using the block types provided. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to achieve this:

```
# First, create the foundation for the letter O
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Create the top part of the letter O
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Create the bottom part of the letter O
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Using these commands, the blocks will be placed consecutively to form the shape of the letter O within the allowed space boundaries.
