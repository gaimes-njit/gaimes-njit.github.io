To generate the uppercase English letter "O", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) as the foundation at position 2: 
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the foundation: 
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. For the top part of the letter, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: 
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Combining all the steps, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "O" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
