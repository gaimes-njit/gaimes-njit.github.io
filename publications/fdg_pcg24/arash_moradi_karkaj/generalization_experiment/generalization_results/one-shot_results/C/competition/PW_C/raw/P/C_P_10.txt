To generate the uppercase English letter "P", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block at position 1 to create the foundation of the letter.
2. Place a vertical straight block at position 1 to create the left vertical line of the letter.
3. Place another vertical straight block at position 2 to complete the left vertical line of the letter.
4. Place a square block at position 1 to create the top part of the letter.
5. Place square blocks at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 to complete the top part of the letter.

These commands will generate an uppercase "P" in the Tetris-like environment.
