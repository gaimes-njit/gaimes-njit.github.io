To generate the uppercase letter "P" using the given block types and commands, follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: ab_drop('b31', 2)
2. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) to the left of the foundation:
   - Place the first vertical block at position 1: ab_drop('b13', 1)
   - Place the second vertical block at position 2: ab_drop('b13', 2)
3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation at position 2: ab_drop('b31', 2)

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "P":

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
