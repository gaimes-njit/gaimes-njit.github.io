To generate uppercase letter "P", we need to utilize the block types b31 and b13 in the following pattern:

1. Foundation: Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2.
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Vertical Strokes: Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left of the foundation, at positions 1 and 2.
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Top Part: Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation at position 2.
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Combine all the commands together:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "P" within the allowed space and following the gravity rules.
