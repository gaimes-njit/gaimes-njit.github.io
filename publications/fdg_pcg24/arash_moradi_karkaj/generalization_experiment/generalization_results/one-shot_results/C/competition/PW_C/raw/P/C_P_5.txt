To generate the uppercase English letter "P", the stream of ab_drop() commands would resemble the following:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
3. The third command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2.
4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.

This sequence of commands constructs the letter "P" by stacking the blocks in the specified order and following the gravity rules of the environment.
