To generate the uppercase English letter "P", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` creates the foundation of the letter "P" with a horizontal straight block starting at position 1.
- The next three commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)`, `ab_drop('b13', 2)`, and `ab_drop('b13', 3)` create the vertical straight blocks on the left side of the foundation.
- Finally, the last two commands `ab_drop('b31', 1)` and `ab_drop('b31', 2)` add the top part of the letter "P" using two horizontal straight blocks.

Note: Make sure to execute the commands consecutively in the given order to accurately generate the letter "P".
