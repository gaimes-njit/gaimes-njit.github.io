To generate the uppercase letter "Q", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal base of the letter
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the left vertical part of the letter
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place the right vertical part of the letter
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place the top part of the letter
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Add stability to the right vertical part of the letter
```

This will create a letter "Q" shape using the given block types and within the allowed space boundaries.
