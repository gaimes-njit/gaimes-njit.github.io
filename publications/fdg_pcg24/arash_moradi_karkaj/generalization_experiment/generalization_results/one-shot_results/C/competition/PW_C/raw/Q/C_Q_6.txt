To generate the uppercase English letter "Q", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

The explanation for each command is as follows:
- `ab_drop('b31', 1)`: Start by placing a horizontal straight block at position 1 to form the foundation of the "Q".
- `ab_drop('b13', 1)`: Place a vertical straight block at position 1 to the left of the foundation.
- `ab_drop('b13', 2)`: Place another vertical straight block at position 2 to the left of the foundation.
- `ab_drop('b13', 3)`: Place one more vertical straight block at position 3 to the left of the foundation.
- `ab_drop('b13', 3)`: Place another vertical straight block at position 3 to complete the vertical part of the "Q".
- `ab_drop('b11', 1)`: Place a square block at position 1 on top of the foundation.
- `ab_drop('b11', 1)`: Place another square block at position 1 on top of the previous block.
- `ab_drop('b11', 2)`: Place a square block at position 2 on top of the foundation.
- `ab_drop('b11', 3)`: Place a square block at position 3 on top of the foundation.
- `ab_drop('b11', 3)`: Place another square block at position 3 on top of the previous block.
- `ab_drop('b11', 3)`: Place one more square block at position 3 on top of the previous block.
- `ab_drop('b11', 2)`: Place another square block at position 2 on top of the previous block.
- `ab_drop('b11', 2)`: Place one more square block at position 2 on top of the previous block.

By following these commands in order, you should be able to generate the uppercase English letter "Q".
