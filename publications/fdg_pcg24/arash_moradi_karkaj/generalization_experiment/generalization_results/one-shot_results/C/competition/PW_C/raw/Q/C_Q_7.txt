To generate the uppercase letter "Q" using the given block types and environment, we can break it down into smaller steps:

1. Establish the foundation for the letter by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Add two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the foundation to form the tail of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Finally, add another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation to complete the loop of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "Q" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
