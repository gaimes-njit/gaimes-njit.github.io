To generate the uppercase English letter "Q", we need to follow the pattern mentioned in the examples. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Foundation for the letter Q
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Double vertical block on the left
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Double vertical block on the left
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Top part of the letter Q
```

The above commands will create the letter "Q" with accurate representation and fit within the allowed space boundaries.
