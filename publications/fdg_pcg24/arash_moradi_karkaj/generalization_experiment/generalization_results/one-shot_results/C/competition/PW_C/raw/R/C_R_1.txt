To generate the uppercase letter "R", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal foundation block in the first position along the width
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical block on the left side of the foundation
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place another vertical block on the left side of the foundation
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal block on top of the foundation and the left vertical blocks
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical block to the right of the top horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place a horizontal block to the right of the top vertical block
```

These commands will create a stable structure that forms the uppercase letter "R" within the allowed space boundaries.
