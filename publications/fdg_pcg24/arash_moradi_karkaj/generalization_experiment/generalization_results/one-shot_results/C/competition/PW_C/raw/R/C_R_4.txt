To generate the uppercase English letter "R", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

2. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left of the foundation:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. For the top part of the letter, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

4. The final sequence of commands to generate the letter "R" would be:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```
