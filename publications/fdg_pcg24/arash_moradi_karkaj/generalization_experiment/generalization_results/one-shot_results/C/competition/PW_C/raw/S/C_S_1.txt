To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```python
# Place the bottom horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Place the vertical blocks on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Place the top horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will create the letter "S" within the given environment and follow the gravity rules.
