To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we can use the block types b11, b31, and b13. 

Here is a possible stream of commands to construct the letter "S":

```
# Step 1: Construct the bottom-left curve
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place a square block at position 2

# Step 2: Construct the top-left curve
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical block at position 2

# Step 3: Construct the top-right curve
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical block at position 2

# Step 4: Construct the bottom-right curve
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place a square block at position 2
```

By following these commands, the letter "S" will be accurately represented and fit within the allowed space boundaries of the grid.
