S: To create the letter "S", we can start by placing a horizontal straight block in the middle of the grid at position (2, 1). Then, we can place a vertical straight block on the left side of the horizontal block at positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3). Finally, we can place another horizontal straight block on top of the vertical blocks at positions (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 2). 

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "S":

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

Please note that each command should be executed consecutively in the given order to accurately represent the letter "S" in the Tetris-like environment.
