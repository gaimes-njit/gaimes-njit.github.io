To create the uppercase letter "S" using the given block types and environment, the following sequence of ab_drop() commands should be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Foundation of the letter
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Duplicate the foundation block
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Vertical block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Vertical block on the left side
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Top part of the letter
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Duplicate the top part
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Bottom part of the letter
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Duplicate the bottom part
```

This sequence of commands will construct a stable representation of the uppercase letter "S" within the defined boundaries.
