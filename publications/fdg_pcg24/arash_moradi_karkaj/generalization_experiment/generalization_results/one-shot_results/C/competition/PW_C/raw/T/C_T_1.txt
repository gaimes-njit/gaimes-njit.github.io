To generate the uppercase English letter "T", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` creates the foundation of the letter "T" by placing a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 2 along the width.
- The next two commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)` and `ab_drop('b13', 2)` add two vertical straight blocks of height 3 on the left side of the foundation block, creating the vertical part of the letter.
