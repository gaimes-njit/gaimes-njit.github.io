To create the uppercase English letter "T", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The foundation of the "T" is created by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at the 2nd position along the width.
- Two vertical straight blocks (b13) are placed on the left side of the foundation, at positions 1 and 2.
- Finally, another horizontal straight block (b31) is placed at the 2nd position along the width to complete the top part of the "T".
