To generate the uppercase English letter "T", you can use the following commands:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. The foundation of the letter "T" is created by placing a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 2 along the width.
2. To add the vertical part of the letter, two vertical straight blocks (`b13`) are placed on the left side of the foundation. The first block is placed at position 1 and the second block is placed at position 2.
3. Finally, to complete the top part of the letter, another horizontal straight block (`b31`) is placed at position 2.

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively and follow the gravity rules to maintain the stability of the letter shape within the allowed space boundaries.
