To generate the uppercase letter "T" using the given block types and rules, you can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place the horizontal straight block as the foundation in the middle (at width position 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the left vertical straight block above the foundation (at width position 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Place the right vertical straight block above the foundation (at width position 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place the horizontal straight block on top of the foundation to complete the "T" shape (at width position 2)
```

By following these commands, you will create the uppercase letter "T" within the allowed space boundaries while maintaining structural stability with the gravity rules.
