To generate the uppercase English letter "T", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will create a foundation using a horizontal straight block at position 2. Then, two vertical straight blocks will be placed to the left of the foundation at positions 1 and 2. Finally, another horizontal straight block will be placed on top of the foundation at position 2, completing the letter "T".
