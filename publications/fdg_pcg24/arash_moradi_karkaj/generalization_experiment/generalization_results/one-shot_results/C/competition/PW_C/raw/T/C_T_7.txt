To generate the uppercase letter "T", we can start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2. This will serve as the foundation for the letter.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Next, we need to add the vertical part of the letter. We can do this by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the foundation. We will start at position 1 and increment the y-coordinate for each block.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Finally, to complete the top part of the letter "T", we can add another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation. This will complete the shape of the letter.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "T" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
