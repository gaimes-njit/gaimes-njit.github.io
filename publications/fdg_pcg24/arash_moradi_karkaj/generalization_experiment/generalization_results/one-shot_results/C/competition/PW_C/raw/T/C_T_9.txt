To generate the uppercase English letter "T", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place the horizontal straight block as the foundation
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place the left vertical straight block on top
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place the right vertical straight block on top
```

These commands will create a stable structure resembling the letter "T" within the allowed space in the grid.
