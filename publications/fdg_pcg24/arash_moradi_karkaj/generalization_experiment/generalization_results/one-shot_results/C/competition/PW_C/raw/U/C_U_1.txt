To generate the uppercase letter "U", you can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.
2. Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 1 and position 3: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`, `ab_drop('b13', 3)`.
3. Place another horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 2, above the previous blocks: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the letter "U" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Make sure to execute these commands consecutively, one after the other.
