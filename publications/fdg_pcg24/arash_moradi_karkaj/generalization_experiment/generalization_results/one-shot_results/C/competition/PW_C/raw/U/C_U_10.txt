To create the uppercase English letter "U", we can break it down into the following steps:

1. Create the left vertical line of the letter:
   - Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
   - Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2.

2. Create the bottom horizontal line of the letter:
   - Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2.

3. Create the right vertical line of the letter:
   - Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 3.
   - Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 4.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "U":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Please note that these commands should be executed consecutively, following the 2D gravity rules, to accurately create the letter "U" within the allowed space boundaries.
