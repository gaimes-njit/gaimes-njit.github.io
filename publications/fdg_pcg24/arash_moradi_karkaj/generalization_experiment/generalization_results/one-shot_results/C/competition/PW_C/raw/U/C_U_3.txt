To generate the uppercase English letter "U", the following stream of ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31',1) 
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

Explanation:

1. The first command `ab_drop('b31',1)` places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, forming the bottom part of the "U".

2. The second command `ab_drop('b13',1)` places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, forming the left side of the "U".

3. The third command `ab_drop('b11',2)` places a square block (b11) at position 2, forming the connecting part between the left and right sides of the "U".

4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b13',3)` places another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3, forming the right side of the "U".

5. The fifth command `ab_drop('b31',3)` places another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3, forming the top part of the "U".

By following these instructions, the uppercase English letter "U" can be generated in the Tetris-like environment.
