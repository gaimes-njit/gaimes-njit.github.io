To generate the uppercase letter "U", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:

1. `ab_drop('b31', 1)`: This places a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units at position 1, creating the foundation of the letter "U".
2. `ab_drop('b13', 1)`: This places a vertical straight block with a height of 3 units at position 1, on the left side of the foundation.
3. `ab_drop('b11', 2)` and `ab_drop('b11', 3)`: These commands place two square blocks of width 1 unit each at positions 2 and 3, respectively. These blocks form the middle part of the letter "U".
4. `ab_drop('b13', 3)`: This places another vertical straight block with a height of 3 units at position 3, on the right side of the middle part.
5. `ab_drop('b31', 3)`: Finally, this places a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units on top of the right side vertical block, completing the top part of the letter "U".
