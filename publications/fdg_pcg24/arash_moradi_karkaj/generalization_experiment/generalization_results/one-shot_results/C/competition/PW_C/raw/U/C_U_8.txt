To create the uppercase letter "U" using the given block types, the following stream of ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2. This will serve as the foundation for the letter "U".
2. Place two vertical straight blocks ('b13') to the left of the foundation. These blocks will form the left side of the letter "U".
3. Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') on top of the foundation, aligned with the previous one. This will form the top part of the letter "U".
4. Finally, place two vertical straight blocks ('b13') to the right of the foundation, aligned with the left side blocks. These blocks will form the right side of the letter "U".

By following these commands, the uppercase letter "U" will be accurately represented within the allowed space boundaries, while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
