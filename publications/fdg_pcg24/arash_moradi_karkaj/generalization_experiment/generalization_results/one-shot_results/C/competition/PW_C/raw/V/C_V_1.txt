To generate the uppercase letter "V" using the ab_drop() commands and the given block types, follow the below steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: ab_drop('b31', 1)
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) on the left side of the horizontal block at position 1: ab_drop('b13', 1)
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) on the left side of the previous block at position 1: ab_drop('b13', 1)
4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous horizontal block at position 2: ab_drop('b31', 2)

The stream of commands to generate the letter "V" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
