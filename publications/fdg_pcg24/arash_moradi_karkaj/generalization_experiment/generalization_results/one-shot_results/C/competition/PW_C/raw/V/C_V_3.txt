To generate the uppercase letter "V", we will use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` creates the foundation of the letter "V" by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` adds the left side of the letter "V" by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
3. The third command `ab_drop('b13', 3)` completes the letter "V" by adding the right side with another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3.

Using these commands in sequence will generate the uppercase letter "V" in the Tetris-like environment.
