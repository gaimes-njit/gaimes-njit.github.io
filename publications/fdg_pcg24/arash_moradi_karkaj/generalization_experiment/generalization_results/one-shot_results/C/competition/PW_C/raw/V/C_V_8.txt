To generate the uppercase letter "V", the following sequence of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place another vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place a horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place another horizontal block at position 3
```

This sequence will create a stable and accurate representation of the letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries.
