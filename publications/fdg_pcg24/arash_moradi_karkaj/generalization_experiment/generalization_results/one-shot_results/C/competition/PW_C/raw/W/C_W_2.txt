To generate the uppercase letter "W", we can break it down into multiple steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) as the base of the letter. Place it at position 2.
2. Next, place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the base. Place the first block at position 1 and the second block at position 2.
3. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the base, centered at position 2.

Here are the commands to generate the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
