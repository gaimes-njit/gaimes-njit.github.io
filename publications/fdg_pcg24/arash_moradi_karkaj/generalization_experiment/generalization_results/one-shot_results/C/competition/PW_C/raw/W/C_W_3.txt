To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we can break it down into four sections: the two outer vertical lines and the two diagonal lines in between.

First, we will start by placing the two vertical lines using the b13 block type. We will place one line on the left side and one line on the right side.

Stream of commands:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Next, we will place two diagonal lines using the b31 block type. The first diagonal line will be placed above and to the left of the left vertical line. The second diagonal line will be placed above and to the right of the right vertical line.

Stream of commands:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Finally, we will complete the letter "W" by placing a horizontal line using the b31 block type. This line will connect the two diagonal lines.

Stream of commands:
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "W" would be:

Stream of commands:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
