To create the uppercase English letter "W" using the given block types in the defined environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to construct the foundation of the letter: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) to the left of the foundation at position 1 to form the left side of the letter: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) to the left of the foundation at position 2 to complete the left side of the letter: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`

4. Finally, place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation at position 2 to form the top part of the letter: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "W" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
