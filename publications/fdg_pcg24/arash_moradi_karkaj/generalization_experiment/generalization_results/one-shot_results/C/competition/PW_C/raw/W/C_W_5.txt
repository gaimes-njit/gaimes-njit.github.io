To create the uppercase letter "W" using the given block types and rules, I will provide a stream of commands as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place two vertical blocks ('b13') at positions 1 and 2 to create the left side of the "W".
- Then, we place a horizontal block ('b31') at position 3 to form the middle part of the "W".
- Next, we place a single square block ('b11') at position 4 to create the connecting point between the middle and right side of the "W".
- After that, we place another horizontal block ('b31') at position 5 to complete the middle part.
- Finally, we place two vertical blocks ('b13') at positions 6 and 7 to form the right side of the "W". We also place a horizontal block ('b31') at position 8 to stabilize the structure.

This sequence of commands should generate a stable representation of the uppercase letter "W" within the defined environment.
