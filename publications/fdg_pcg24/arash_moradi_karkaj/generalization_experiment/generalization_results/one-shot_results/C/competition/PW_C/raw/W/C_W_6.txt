To create the letter "W" using the given block types and gravity rules, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal base block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the left vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the middle vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the right vertical block
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the top horizontal block
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries, ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
