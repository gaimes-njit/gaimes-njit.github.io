To generate the uppercase English letter "W", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

Explanation:
- First, we create the left slant of the "W" using vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Then, we create the middle part of the "W" using a horizontal straight block (b31) at positions 2, 3, 6, and 7.
- Finally, we create the right slant of the "W" using square blocks (b11) at positions 3, 4, and 5.

Make sure to place the blocks incrementally and in the correct order to create the desired letter shape while ensuring stability with gravity rules.
