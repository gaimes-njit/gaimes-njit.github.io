To generate the letter "W" using the specified block types and rules in the given environment, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
```

Explanation of the commands:

1. `ab_drop('b31', 1)`: Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to form the first part of the letter "W".

2. `ab_drop('b13', 2)`: Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 to form the second part of the letter "W".

3. `ab_drop('b13', 5)`: Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 to complete the second part of the letter "W".

4. `ab_drop('b31', 6)`: Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 6 to form the third part of the letter "W".

5. `ab_drop('b13', 9)`: Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 9 to form the fourth part of the letter "W".

6. `ab_drop('b13', 12)`: Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 12 to complete the fourth part of the letter "W".

7. `ab_drop('b31', 13)`: Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 13 to form the fifth part of the letter "W".

By executing these commands consecutively, we can generate the uppercase English letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring stability according to the gravity rules.
