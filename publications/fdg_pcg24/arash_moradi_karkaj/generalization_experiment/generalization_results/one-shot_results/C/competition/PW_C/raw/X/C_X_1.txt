To generate the uppercase English letter "X" using the mentioned command and block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) as the foundation of the letter, starting at position 2 on the grid:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, place two vertical straight blocks (b13) to the left of the foundation. Start by placing the first block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
Then, place the second vertical block at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Finally, for the top part of the letter, place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation, starting at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "X" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
