The stream of commands to generate the letter "X" would be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:

1. The foundation for the letter "X" is created by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width.
2. Then, two vertical straight blocks (b13) are placed on the left of the foundation at positions 1 and 2. This forms the left side of the letter "X".
3. Another horizontal straight block (b31) is placed at position 2, on top of the foundation. This forms the top part of the letter "X".
4. Finally, two vertical straight blocks (b13) are placed on the right side of the foundation at positions 3 and 2. This completes the letter "X".

Please note that the commands should be executed consecutively in the given order to accurately form the letter "X".
