To generate the uppercase English letter "X", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

1. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) as the foundation:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place the vertical straight block (b13) to create the first diagonal line:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Place the vertical straight block (b13) to create the second diagonal line:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

This completes the construction of the uppercase letter "X" within the allowed space boundaries.
