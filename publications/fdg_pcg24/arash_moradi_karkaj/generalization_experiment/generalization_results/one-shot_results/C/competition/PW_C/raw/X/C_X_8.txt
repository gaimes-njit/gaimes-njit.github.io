To generate the uppercase letter "X", we can use a combination of block types b31 and b13. Here is the stream of commands to create the letter:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places a horizontal straight block at position 2, creating the bottom part of the X.
- The second command `ab_drop('b31', 4)` places another horizontal straight block at position 4, creating the top part of the X.
- The third command `ab_drop('b13', 3)` places a vertical straight block at position 3, connecting the two horizontal blocks and completing the X shape.
- The fourth command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places a vertical straight block at position 1, creating the diagonal line of the left side of the X.
- The fifth command `ab_drop('b13', 5)` places a vertical straight block at position 5, creating the diagonal line of the right side of the X.

Please note that these commands assume that the game environment starts with an empty grid, and the blocks are placed consecutively one after another using the ab_drop command.
