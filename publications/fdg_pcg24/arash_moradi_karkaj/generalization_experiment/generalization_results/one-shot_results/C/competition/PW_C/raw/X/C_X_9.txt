To generate the uppercase English letter "X" using the mentioned command and block types, here is the stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will stack and position the blocks in a way that forms the letter "X" within the allowed space boundary.
