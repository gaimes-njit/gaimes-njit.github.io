To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) as the foundation of the letter. Place it at position 2 along the width using the command `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the foundation. Place the first vertical block at position 1 and the second vertical block at position 2 using the commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)` and `ab_drop('b13', 2)`.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Finally, complete the top part of the letter "Y" by placing another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation. Place it at position 2 along the width using the command `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "Y" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
