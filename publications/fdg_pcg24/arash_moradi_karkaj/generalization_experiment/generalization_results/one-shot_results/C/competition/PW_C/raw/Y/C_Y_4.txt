To generate the uppercase letter "Y," we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```

This set of commands will form the foundation and vertical parts of the letter "Y" in the specified environment, while maintaining stability according to the gravity rules.
