To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", we can follow the set of instructions below:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, above the horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, next to the previous vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, above the previous horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Overall, the stream of commands to generate the letter "Y" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
