To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", we can follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to create the foundation by placing a horizontal straight block of width 3 at the x position 2. We can achieve this by using the command: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`. This will create the bottom part of the letter "Y".

2. Next, we need to create the double vertical blocks on the left side of the foundation. We can achieve this by placing two vertical straight blocks of height 3 at the x positions 1 and 2. We can use the commands: `ab_drop('b13', 1)` and `ab_drop('b13', 2)` consecutively. This will create the vertical part of the letter "Y".

3. Lastly, we need to create the top part of the letter "Y". We can achieve this by placing another horizontal straight block of width 3 at the x position 2. We can use the command: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`. This will create the top part of the letter "Y".

Here is the complete stream of commands to generate the letter "Y":

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
