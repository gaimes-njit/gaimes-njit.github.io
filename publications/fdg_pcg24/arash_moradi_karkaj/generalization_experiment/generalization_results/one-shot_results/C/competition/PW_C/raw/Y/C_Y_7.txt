To generate the uppercase letter "Y", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will create the letter "Y" in a Tetris-like environment, ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
