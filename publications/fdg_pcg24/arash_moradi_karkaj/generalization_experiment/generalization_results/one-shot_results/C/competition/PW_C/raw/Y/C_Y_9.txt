To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:

1. `ab_drop('b31', 2)`: This command creates the foundation of the letter, which is a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units. It is positioned at x=2.

2. `ab_drop('b13', 1)`: This command creates the left vertical part of the letter, which is a vertical straight block with a height of 3 units. It is positioned at x=1.

3. `ab_drop('b13', 2)`: This command creates the left vertical part of the letter, similar to the previous command. It is also positioned at x=1, right next to the previous block.

4. `ab_drop('b31', 2)`: This command creates the top part of the letter, which is another horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units. It is positioned at x=2.

5. `ab_drop('b13', 3)`: This command creates the right vertical part of the letter, which is another vertical straight block with a height of 3 units. It is positioned at x=3.

By following these commands and positions, the resulting blocks will form the uppercase letter "Y" within the grid while maintaining structural stability according to the gravity rules.
