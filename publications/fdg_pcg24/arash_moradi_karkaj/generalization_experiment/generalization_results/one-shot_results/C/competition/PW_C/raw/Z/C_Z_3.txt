To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1, 2):

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position (1, 1) and another vertical straight block (b13) at position (1, 2):

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1, 2) to complete the top part of the "Z":

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

By following these steps, we should be able to generate the uppercase English letter "Z" within the defined environment and using the given block types.
