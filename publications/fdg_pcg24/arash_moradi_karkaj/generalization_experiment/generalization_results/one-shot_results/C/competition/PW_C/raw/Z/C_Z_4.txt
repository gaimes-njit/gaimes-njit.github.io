To generate the uppercase letter Z, we can break it down into three parts: the top horizontal line, the diagonal line, and the bottom horizontal line. 

First, we need to create the top horizontal line. We can achieve this by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at the appropriate position. Let's place it at position 2:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Next, we need to create the diagonal line. We can achieve this by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) diagonally from each other. Let's place the first one at position 1, and the second one at position 2:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Finally, we need to create the bottom horizontal line. Again, we can use a horizontal straight block (b31) at the appropriate position. Let's place it at position 2:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter Z would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
