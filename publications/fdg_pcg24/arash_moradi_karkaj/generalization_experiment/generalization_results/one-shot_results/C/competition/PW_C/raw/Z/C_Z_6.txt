To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we can use the following series of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. We first drop a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to form the top part of the "Z".
2. Next, we drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to form the left vertical stroke of the "Z".
3. Then, we drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 to extend the height of the left vertical stroke.
4. Finally, we drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 to complete the bottom part of the "Z".

The resulting structure should resemble the uppercase English letter "Z" within the defined environment.
