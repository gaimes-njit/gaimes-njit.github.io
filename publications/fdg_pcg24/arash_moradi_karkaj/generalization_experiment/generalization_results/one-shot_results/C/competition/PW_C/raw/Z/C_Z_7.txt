To create the uppercase letter Z, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

Explanation:
- First, we start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. This will be the bottom of the Z shape.
- Next, we place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 2 and 1. These will form the vertical part of the Z shape.
- Then, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2. This will be the top part of the Z shape.
- Finally, we continue placing horizontal straight blocks (b31) from positions 3 to 8 to complete the rest of the top part of the Z shape.
