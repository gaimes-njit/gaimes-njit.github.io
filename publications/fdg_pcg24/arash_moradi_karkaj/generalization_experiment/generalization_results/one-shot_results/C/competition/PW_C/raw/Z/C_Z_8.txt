To create the uppercase letter "Z", follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the foundation of the letter, which consists of a horizontal straight block (b31) placed at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, place two vertical straight blocks (b13) to the left of the foundation. Place the first one at position 1 and the second one at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Finally, create the top part of the letter by placing another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The complete sequence of commands to generate the uppercase letter "Z" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
