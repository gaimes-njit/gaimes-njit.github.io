To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "G", we need to carefully place the blocks while considering the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

We can approach this step by step as follows:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:

```python
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping positions and order of blocks based on the block-stacking problem. Start by placing the b31 block as the base to provide stability. We can choose slot 8 for the center of the b31 block's base.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

3. Next, place the b11 block on top of the b31 block as the top-left part of the "G" character. We can choose slot 6 for the center of the b11 block.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

4. Place another b11 block adjacent to the previous one to complete the top-left part of the "G" character. We can choose slot 7 for the center of the b11 block.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```

5. Place the b13 block on top of the b11 blocks to form the vertical part of the "G" character. We can choose slot 9 for the center of the b13 block.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

6. Finally, place another b11 block on top of the b13 block to complete the horizontal part of the "G" character. We can choose slot 10 for the center of the b11 block.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

The resulting structure should resemble the character "G" and meet all hard constraints.
