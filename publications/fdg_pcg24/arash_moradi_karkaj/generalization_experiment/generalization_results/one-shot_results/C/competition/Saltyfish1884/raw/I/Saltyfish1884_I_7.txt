To generate a structure that resembles the character "I" and meets all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid with ' ' (empty space) values using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base of the structure by dropping a b11 block at the 9th slot using the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

Step 3: Place the vertical blocks (b13) to form the vertical sections of the "I" character. We can drop two b13 blocks at the 9th slot and the 11th slot respectively:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the base to complete the "I" character. We can drop the b31 block at the 9th slot:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 5: Verify that the generated structure meets the stability constraints:
- The b31 block is placed on a solid base (b11 and b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
- The blocks are placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
- The structure is not separated.

Step 6: Print the final structure to visualize the generated result:
```
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The above steps will generate a new result that meets all the given requirements and resembles the character "I".
