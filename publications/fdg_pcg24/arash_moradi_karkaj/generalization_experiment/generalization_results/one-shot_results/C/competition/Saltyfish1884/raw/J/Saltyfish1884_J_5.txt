To generate a stable structure resembling the character "J" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place a b31 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) to act as the base:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place the b31 block at slot 9
```

Step 3: Place a b13 block on top of the base to create the vertical part of the "J" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place the b13 block at slot 9
```

Step 4: Place a b11 block adjacent to the vertical part to create the bottom horizontal part of the "J" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Place the b11 block at slot 8
```

Step 5: Place two more b11 blocks above the bottom horizontal part to complete the "J" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Place the first b11 block at slot 7
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place the second b11 block at slot 6
```

The resulting structure grid will resemble the character "J":

```
 ---------
|         |
|         |
|     o   |
|     o   |
| ooo o   |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|_________|
```

Note: The slot numbers and center alignment for block placement were chosen based on the provided ab_drop() function and the desired shape of the character "J".
