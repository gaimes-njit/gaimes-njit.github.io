To generate a stable structure resembling the character "K" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid
Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Determine the dropping positions and order of the blocks
Given the stability rules, we need to ensure that the structure is stable and does not collapse.

For the base of the "K" character, we can use a b31 block placed on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks). To do this, we can use the ab_drop() function to drop a b31 block at the center slot (y=9) aligned with the bottom layer (H-1). This will ensure that the base is stable and properly aligned.

Next, we can drop two b13 blocks on top of the base, each aligned with the center slot (y=9) but placed one slot to the left (x=7) and one slot to the right (x=11) of the previously dropped b31 block. This will create the two vertical strokes of the "K" character.

Finally, we can drop a b13 block on top of the previously dropped b31 block, aligned with the center slot (y=9) and centered horizontally (x=9). This will create the horizontal stroke of the "K" character.

The dropping order should be: b31, b13, b13, b13.

Step 3: Use the ab_drop() function to drop the blocks
Using the determined dropping positions and order, we can use the ab_drop() function to place the suitable blocks and form the structure that resembles the given character.

Here is the code to generate the stable structure resembling the character "K":
```
# Step 1: Initialize the structure grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Determine the dropping positions and order of the blocks
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop the b31 block on the base
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Drop the first b13 block on the left vertical stroke
ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Drop the second b13 block on the right vertical stroke
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop the last b13 block on the horizontal stroke

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The output will be a stable structure resembling the character "K". You can adjust the dropping positions and order based on your desired visualization of the character.
