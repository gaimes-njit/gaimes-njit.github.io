To generate a stable structure resembling the character "R" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Determine the dropping positions for each block type to ensure stability and adherence to the constraints.

Step 3: Drop b13 block (vertical block) at slot 9 so that it is placed as low as possible and acts as the base for stability.
ab_drop('b13', 9)

Step 4: Drop b11 block (square block) at slot 8 on top of the base to prevent overhangs.
ab_drop('b11', 8)

Step 5: Drop b11 block at slot 7 on top of the previous block to continue building the structure.
ab_drop('b11', 7)

Step 6: Drop b11 block at slot 6 above the previous block to complete the first vertical line of the "R".
ab_drop('b11', 6)

Step 7: Drop b31 block (horizontal block) at slot 5, aligning its center with the previous blocks to form the horizontal line of the "R".
ab_drop('b31', 5)

Step 8: Drop b11 block at slot 6 to bridge the gap between the previous blocks and complete the horizontal line of the "R".
ab_drop('b11', 6)

Step 9: Drop b11 block at slot 5 above the previous block to continue building the second vertical line of the "R".
ab_drop('b11', 5)

Step 10: Drop b31 block at slot 4 to form the diagonal line of the "R". This block will rest on the base and the previous blocks to ensure stability.
ab_drop('b31', 4)

Step 11: Drop b11 block at slot 3 above the previous block to complete the second vertical line of the "R".
ab_drop('b11', 3)

Step 12: Drop b11 block at slot 2 above the previous block to continue building the third vertical line of the "R".
ab_drop('b11', 2)

Step 13: Drop b31 block at slot 1 to form the diagonal line of the "R". This block will rest on the base and the previous blocks to ensure stability.
ab_drop('b31', 1)

Step 14: Drop b11 block at slot 0 above the previous block to complete the third vertical line of the "R".
ab_drop('b11', 0)

After following these steps, the resulting structure will resemble the character "R" while satisfying all hard constraints.
