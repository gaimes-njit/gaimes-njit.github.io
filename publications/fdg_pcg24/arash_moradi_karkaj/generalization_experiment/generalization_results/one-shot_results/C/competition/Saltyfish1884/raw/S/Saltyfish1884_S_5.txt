To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Define the shape of the structure: 
   - We will use b11, b31, and b13 blocks to form an "S" shape. 
   - The structure will consist of two b13 blocks stacked vertically, one b31 block placed horizontally on top of the left end of the top b13 block, and one b31 block placed horizontally on top of the right end of the bottom b13 block. 

2. Initialize the structure:
   - Use the given code to initialize an empty WxH grid.

3. Drop the blocks using the ab_drop() function:
   - First, drop the bottom b13 block at the center slot position, aligned with the bottom layer (layer 0).
   - Then, drop the top b13 block at the same center slot position, aligned with the layer above the bottom layer.
   - Next, drop the left b31 block aligned with the left end of the top b13 block, ensuring stability.
   - Finally, drop the right b31 block aligned with the right end of the bottom b13 block, ensuring stability.

Here is the code to achieve the above steps:

```
# Define shape of the structure
structure_shape = [
    [' ', ' ', ' '],
    ['b13', 'b31', ' '],
    ['b31', 'b13', ' ']
]

# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks to form the structure
for row, layer in enumerate(structure_shape):
    for col, block_type in enumerate(layer):
        if block_type != ' ':
            center_slot = (W // 2) + col
            ab_drop(block_type, center_slot)

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(row)
```

Please note that the code above assumes that the ab_drop() function has been defined correctly and that you have access to the block types b11, b31, and b13.
