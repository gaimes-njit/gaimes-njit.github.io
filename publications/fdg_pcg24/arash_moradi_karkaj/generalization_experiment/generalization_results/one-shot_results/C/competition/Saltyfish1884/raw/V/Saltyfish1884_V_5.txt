To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "V" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base of the structure by dropping a b11 block at the center slot:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
This will ensure a solid base for the structure.

Step 3: Place the upper part of the "V" shape by dropping a b31 block on top of the base, aligned with the center slot:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 4: Place the left arm of the "V" shape by dropping a b13 block on the left side of the upper part, aligned with the center slot:
```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

Step 5: Place the right arm of the "V" shape by dropping a b13 block on the right side of the upper part, aligned with the center slot:
```
ab_drop('b13', 12)
```

Step 6: The final structure resembling the character "V" has been generated. You can visualize it by printing the structure:
```
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This will print the structure grid with the blocks forming the character "V".

Note: The specific positions and order of dropping the blocks may vary based on the chosen approach for the block-stacking problem, but the idea is to ensure stability and meet the hard constraints mentioned in part 5.
