To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Y", we need to follow the given constraints and use the ab_drop() function to place the blocks in a suitable order and position.

First, let's analyze the stability constraints:
1) A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs: We will start by dropping a b11 block in the middle slot (slot 10) of the base layer (layer 0).
2) Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing: We will drop the blocks in a step-by-step manner, starting from the base layer and moving upwards.
3) Structure should not be separated: We will ensure that the blocks are placed in a way that they are connected and form a single structure.

Based on the stability constraints, the structure should have a b11 block as the base with a b31 block placed on it. The remaining part of the structure will resemble the shape of the character "Y".

Using the ab_drop() function, we can place the blocks accordingly:
- Drop a b11 block in the middle slot of the base layer (ab_drop('b11', 10)).
- Drop a b31 block on top of the b11 block, ensuring it is aligned with the base (ab_drop('b31', 10)).
- Drop a b13 block to the left of the b31 block, aligning it with the left edge of the base (ab_drop('b13', 7)).
- Drop another b13 block to the right of the b31 block, aligning it with the right edge of the base (ab_drop('b13', 13)).

The resulting structure will resemble the character "Y" and meet all the hard constraints.
