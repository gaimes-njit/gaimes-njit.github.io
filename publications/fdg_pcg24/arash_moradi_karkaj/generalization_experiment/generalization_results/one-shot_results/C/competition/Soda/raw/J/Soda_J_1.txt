To build the structure that looks like the letter "J" in the level, we can use the following code:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Explanation:
1. We drop a row block ("b31") centered at position 9. This creates the top horizontal bar of the letter "J" occupying cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).
2. We drop another row block ("b31") centered at position 9. This creates the middle vertical bar of the letter "J" occupying cells (8, 1), (9, 1), and (10, 1).
3. Finally, we drop a column block ("b13") centered at position 9. This creates the bottom tick of the letter "J" occupying cells (9, 2), (9, 1), and (9, 0).

The resulting structure will resemble the letter "J" and will be stable.
