To create a structure that looks like the letter "K" in the level, we can break it down into multiple blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Create the base horizontal block at the bottom:
   - Drop a row block ('b31') at the center position (x_position = 9): ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Create the two vertical blocks:
   - Drop a column block ('b13') at the center position (x_position = 8): ab_drop("b13", 8)
   - Drop a column block ('b13') at the center position (x_position = 10): ab_drop("b13", 10)

3. Create the top horizontal block:
   - Drop a row block ('b31') at the center position (x_position = 9): ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete implementation code is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
