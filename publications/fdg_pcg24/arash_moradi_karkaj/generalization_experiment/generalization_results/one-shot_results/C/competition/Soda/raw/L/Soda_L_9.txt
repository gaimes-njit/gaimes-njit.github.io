To create the letter "L" in the level, we can use the following steps:

1. First, drop a "b31" block centered at x_position=9:
ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Next, drop a "b13" block centered at x_position=9:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

3. Finally, drop another "b11" block centered at x_position=11:
ab_drop("b11", 11)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```
