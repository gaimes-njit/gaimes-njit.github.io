To build the letter "N" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: a column block for the left side of the "N", a row block for the middle part, and another column block for the right side of the "N". 

We will start by dropping the left column block at the leftmost position of the level. Then we will drop the row block at the center position of the level. Finally, we will drop the right column block at the rightmost position of the level.

Here is the code implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 0)  # Drop the left column block at x_position=0
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Drop the row block at x_position=9
ab_drop("b13", 19)  # Drop the right column block at x_position=19
```

This code will generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital character "N" (TARGET) with the best stability and similarity.
