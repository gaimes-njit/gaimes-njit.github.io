To create a structure in the shape of the capital letter "V", we can follow the bottom-to-top approach as mentioned. We will start by placing the base blocks and gradually build upwards to form the letter "V". Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the base block (a row block) at the bottom center.
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 2: Place two column blocks on top of the base block, slightly offset to form the sides of the "V".
```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
```

Step 3: Place a row block on top of the column blocks to connect them and complete the formation of the "V".
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This sequence of ab_drop() function calls will create a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "V".
