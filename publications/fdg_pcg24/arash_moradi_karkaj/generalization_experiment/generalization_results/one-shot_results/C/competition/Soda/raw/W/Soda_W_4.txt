To create a structure that looks like a capital "W", we can break it down into three blocks. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the bottom-left "b31" block at position 5 to form the bottom left of the "W".
```py
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

2. Place the bottom-right "b31" block at position 9 to form the bottom right of the "W".
```py
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

3. Place the top "b13" block at position 7 to form the top part of the "W".
```py
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

The complete implementation looks like this:
```py
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```
