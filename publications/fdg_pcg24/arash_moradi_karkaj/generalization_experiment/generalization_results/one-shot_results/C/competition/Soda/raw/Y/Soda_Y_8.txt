To generate a structure in the shape of a capital letter "Y", we can break it down into three blocks: a row block (b31) for the top part, a column block (b13) for the middle part, and another row block (b31) for the bottom part. 

To ensure stability, we need to start building from the bottom and work our way up. 

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Drop the bottom row block at x_position=10
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Drop the middle column block at x_position=10
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Drop the top row block at x_position=10
