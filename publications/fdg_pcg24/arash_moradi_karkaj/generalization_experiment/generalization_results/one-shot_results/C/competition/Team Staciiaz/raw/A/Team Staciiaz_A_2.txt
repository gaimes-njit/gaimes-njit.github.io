To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "A", we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. The main idea is to stack blocks in such a way that they form the shape of the character "A" without compromising stability or intruding on the boundary of the map.

Here is an outline of the steps to generate the structure:

1. Drop the base block (b13) centered at slot 9 using `ab_drop('b13', 9)`. This block will be dropped on layer 0, forming the base of the structure.

2. Drop the left leg of the "A" shape by dropping a block (b31) centered at slot 7 on layer 3 using `ab_drop('b31', 7)`. This block will be placed on top of the base block.

3. Drop the right leg of the "A" shape by dropping a block (b31) centered at slot 11 on layer 3 using `ab_drop('b31', 11)`. This block will also be placed on top of the base block.

4. Drop the top of the "A" shape by dropping a block (b31) centered at slot 9 on layer 6 using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`. This block will be placed on top of the legs of the "A" shape.

5. Finally, drop a single block (b11) centered at slot 9 on layer 10 using `ab_drop('b11', 9)`. This block will sit on top of the structure and complete the shape of the character "A".

The resulting structure will have a stable "A" shape and will meet all the given constraints, including stability and no boundary intrusion.

Please note that the exact positions and order of dropping the blocks may vary based on the specific implementation and adjustments needed for stability. The provided steps aim to give a general idea of how to use the `ab_drop()` function to generate the desired structure.
