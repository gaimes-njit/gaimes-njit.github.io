To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "C" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function and follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the vertical block `b13` at slot 4 using `ab_drop('b13', 4)`.

Step 2: Place the horizontal block `b31` at slot 2 using `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.

Step 3: Continue placing the horizontal block `b31` at slot 1 using `ab_drop('b31', 1)`.

Step 4: Place the square block `b11` at slot 3 using `ab_drop('b11', 3)`.

The resulting structure will be a stable structure that looks like the character "C" and meets all the constraints.
