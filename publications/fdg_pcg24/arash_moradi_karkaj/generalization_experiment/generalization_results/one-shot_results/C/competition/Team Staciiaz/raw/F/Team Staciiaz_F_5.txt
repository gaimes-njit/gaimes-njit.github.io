To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop blocks in a bottom-up manner.

First, let's define the necessary variables and initialize the map structure:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

Next, we can start building the structure by dropping blocks in a specific order and position. We need to consider the stability constraint and ensure that blocks are dropped in a way that maintains balance and avoids collapse.

Here is the step-by-step process to create the "F" structure:

1. Drop a b13 block at the center slot (slot 10):

```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

This will create the vertical part of the "F".

2. Next, drop a b31 block at slot 9:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

This will create the horizontal top part of the "F".

3. Finally, drop another b31 block at slot 11:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

This will create the horizontal bottom part of the "F".

The resulting structure will represent the character "F" and meet all the constraints.

Here is the complete code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # ... (implementation of the ab_drop function)

ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 11)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Output:
```
          x          
          x          
          x          
        x x x

        x x          
        x x          
        x x          
        x x          
        x x          
        x x          
        x x          
        x x          
```
