To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "G" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Drop the b31 block at slot 5 to create the top horizontal bar of the "G". Use the `ab_drop()` function as follows: `ab_drop('b31', 5)`. This will fill slots 4, 5, and 6 of layer 0 with 'x'.

2. Drop the b13 block at slot 7 to create the top-right vertical bar of the "G". Use the `ab_drop()` function as follows: `ab_drop('b13', 7)`. This will fill slots 7, 6, and 5 of layers 0, 1, and 2 with 'x'.

3. Drop the b13 block at slot 8 to create the bottom-right vertical bar of the "G". Use the `ab_drop()` function as follows: `ab_drop('b13', 8)`. This will fill slots 8, 9, and 10 of layers 0, 1, and 2 with 'x'.

4. Drop the b11 block at slot 7 to create the bottom-horizontal bar of the "G". Use the `ab_drop()` function as follows: `ab_drop('b11', 7)`. This will fill slot 7 of layer 3 with 'x'.

5. Drop the b13 block at slot 7 to create the middle-vertical bar of the "G". Use the `ab_drop()` function as follows: `ab_drop('b13', 7)`. This will fill slots 7, 6, and 5 of layers 3, 4, and 5 with 'x'.

6. Drop the b13 block at slot 8 to create the top-left vertical bar of the "G". Use the `ab_drop()` function as follows: `ab_drop('b13', 8)`. This will fill slots 8, 7, and 6 of layers 3, 4, and 5 with 'x'.

7. Drop the b31 block at slot 5 to create the middle-horizontal bar of the "G". Use the `ab_drop()` function as follows: `ab_drop('b31', 5)`. This will fill slots 4, 5, and 6 of layer 6 with 'x'.

8. Drop the b13 block at slot 2 to create the bottom-left vertical bar of the "G". Use the `ab_drop()` function as follows: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`. This will fill slots 2, 3, and 4 of layers 6, 7, and 8 with 'x'.

9. Drop the b13 block at slot 3 to create the top-left vertical bar of the "G". Use the `ab_drop()` function as follows: `ab_drop('b13', 3)`. This will fill slots 3, 2, and 1 of layers 6, 7, and 8 with 'x'.
 
10. Drop the b31 block at slot 5 to create the bottom-horizontal bar of the "G". Use the `ab_drop()` function as follows: `ab_drop('b31', 5)`. This will fill slots 4, 5, and 6 of layer 9 with 'x'.

11. Drop the b13 block at slot 7 to create the bottom-right vertical bar of the "G". Use the `ab_drop()` function as follows: `ab_drop('b13', 7)`. This will fill slots 7, 6, and 5 of layers 9, 10, and 11 with 'x'.

Your final structure should look like the character "G" and satisfy all the constraints.
