To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "G" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is a possible approach to achieve this:

1. First, initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. To create the letter "G", we will need to drop multiple blocks in a specific order.

3. Start by dropping a b31 block at slot 2 using `ab_drop('b31', 2)`. This will be the top horizontal part of the letter "G".

4. Next, drop a b31 block at slot 2 and at a lower layer (one above the base) using `ab_drop('b31', 2)`. This will be the middle horizontal part of the letter "G".

5. Drop a b13 block at slot 4 and at a lower layer using `ab_drop('b13', 4)`. This will be the vertical part of the letter "G".

6. Finally, drop a b11 block at slot 6 and at a lower layer using `ab_drop('b11', 6)`. This will be the bottom part of the letter "G".

7. After following these steps, the `structure` grid should represent a stable structure that looks like the character "G" and meets all the constraints.

Note: The specific slot positions and order of dropping the blocks may vary depending on the desired appearance of the structure, but this approach gives a general idea of how to use the `ab_drop()` function to achieve the goal.
