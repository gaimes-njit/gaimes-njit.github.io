To generate a stable structure in the shape of the character "H" while satisfying the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a specific sequence.

First, we need to drop the vertical block `b13` at the center of the map to form the vertical part of the "H". We can use the `ab_drop('b13', 9)` command to drop the block at slot 9. This will create a stable structure with the vertical block touching the base.

Next, we can drop two horizontal blocks `b31` on top of the vertical block to form the horizontal parts of the "H". We will drop the first horizontal block at slot 8 using the command `ab_drop('b31', 8)`, and the second horizontal block at slot 10 using `ab_drop('b31', 10)`. These blocks will rest on the vertical block and create a stable structure.

The final structure will look like the character "H" and will be stable, with no boundary intrusion.

Here is the code to generate the stable structure:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # Your implementation of ab_drop() function
    
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

The resulting `structure` grid will represent the stable structure in the form of the character "H".
