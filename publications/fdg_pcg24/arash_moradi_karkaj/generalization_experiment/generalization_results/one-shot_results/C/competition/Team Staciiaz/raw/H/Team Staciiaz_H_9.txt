To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "H" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. First, initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Next, we need to determine the dropping position and order of the blocks to ensure stability. We can use techniques from the block-stacking problem. One possible approach is to start from the base layer and build the structure layer by layer from bottom to top.

3. For the character "H", we can use the following sequence of block drops:

**Step 1:** Drop a vertical block (b13) centered at slot 9 in layer 0 (the base). This block will be the middle part of the "H".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

**Step 2:** Drop a horizontal block (b31) centered at slot 9 in layer 1. This block will be the top part of the "H".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

**Step 3:** Drop another horizontal block (b31) centered at slot 9 in layer 2. This block will be the bottom part of the "H".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

**Step 4:** Drop a vertical block (b13) centered at slot 9 in layer 3.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

**Step 5:** Drop a horizontal block (b31) centered at slot 9 in layer 4.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

**Step 6:** Drop another horizontal block (b31) centered at slot 9 in layer 5.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

**Step 7:** Drop a vertical block (b13) centered at slot 9 in layer 6.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Repeat steps 2-7 for layers 7-14 to complete the "H" shape.

5. Finally, check the stability of the resulting structure to ensure it meets the constraints.
