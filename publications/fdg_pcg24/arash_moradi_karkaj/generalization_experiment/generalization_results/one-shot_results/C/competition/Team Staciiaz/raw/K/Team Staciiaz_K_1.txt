To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "K" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner.

The steps to achieve the goal are as follows:

1. Drop the first block b31 at slot 7. This will be the vertical leg of the "K". Use the command `ab_drop('b31', 7)`.

2. Drop the second block b11 at slot 7. This will be the top horizontal bar of the "K". Use the command `ab_drop('b11', 7)`.

3. Drop the third block b13 at slot 5. This will be the diagonal leg of the "K". Use the command `ab_drop('b13', 5)`.

4. Drop the fourth block b31 at slot 10. This will be the bottom horizontal bar of the "K". Use the command `ab_drop('b31', 10)`.

After following these steps, you should have a stable structure that looks like the character "K", and all the constraints should be satisfied.
