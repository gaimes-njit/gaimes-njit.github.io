To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" and meets all the constraints, we will use the `ab_drop()` function to iteratively drop blocks in a strategic order.

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` list.

2. Determine the dropping positions and order for each block type to satisfy the stability constraint. 

3. To ensure stability, we will drop blocks from the bottom-up, starting with the heaviest blocks and moving towards lighter ones.

4. The first block to drop is the b31 block. This block should be placed at the most left slot (slot 0) and at the bottom layer (layer 0).

   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   ```

5. Next, drop the b11 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with its center. Place this block in the next available slot to the right (slot 1) and at the layer on top of the b31 block.

   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 1)
   ```

6. Finally, drop the b13 block vertically, aligned with its center, on top of the b11 block. This block should be placed at the rightmost slot (slot 2) and at the layer on top of the b11 block.

   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

7. After dropping all the blocks, the resulting structure should resemble the character "L" with proper weight distribution and stable positioning.

By following this sequence of block dropping, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" and meets all the constraints. Note that the exact positions and order of block dropping may vary depending on the specific implementation of the `ab_drop()` function.
