To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "N", we need to consider both the stability constraint and the no boundary intrusion constraint.

Here is the algorithm to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
2. Drop the b13 block at slot 3 using `ab_drop('b13', 3)` to create the left vertical part of the "N".
3. Drop the b31 block at slot 7 using `ab_drop('b31', 7)` to create the middle horizontal part of the "N".
4. Drop the b13 block at slot 11 using `ab_drop('b13', 11)` to create the right vertical part of the "N".

This algorithm ensures that the blocks are dropped in a stable manner, as each block is dropped on top of previously dropped blocks or the base. It also satisfies the no boundary intrusion constraint, as the blocks are placed within the boundaries of the map.

By following this algorithm, the `structure` grid will represent a stable structure that looks like the character "N" and meets all the given constraints.
