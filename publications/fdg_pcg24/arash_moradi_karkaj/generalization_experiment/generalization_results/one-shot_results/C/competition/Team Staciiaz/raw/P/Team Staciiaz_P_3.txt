To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "P" and meets all the constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block (b31) on layer 0 and at slot 2 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
This block represents the vertical stroke of the "P" character.

3. Drop the second block (b13) on layer 5 and at slot 2 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
This block represents the curve of the "P" character.

4. Drop the third block (b11) on layer 5 and at slot 4 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```
This block represents the top part of the "P" character.

5. Drop the fourth block (b31) on layer 7 and at slot 1 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This block represents the horizontal stroke of the "P" character.

6. Drop the fifth block (b11) on layer 7 and at slot 4 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```
This block represents the bottom part of the "P" character.

7. Print the final structure to visualize the result:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```
The final structure will resemble the character "P", meeting the stability constraint and avoiding boundary intrusion.

Note: This is just one possible solution that meets the given constraints. There may be other valid configurations that also satisfy the constraints.
