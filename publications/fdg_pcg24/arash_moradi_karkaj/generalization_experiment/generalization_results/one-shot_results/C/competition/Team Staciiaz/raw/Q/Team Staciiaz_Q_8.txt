To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Q" and meets all the constraints, we can use the ab_drop() function to drop the blocks in a strategic manner. Here's an approach to achieve this:

1. We can start by dropping a b11 block in the center slot (slot 9) at layer 0 to serve as the base of the "Q" shape. We can do this by calling the ab_drop() function with the arguments ab_drop('b11', 9).

2. Next, we need to vertically stack a b13 block on top of the base block. We can drop the b13 block in slot 9 at layer 4 to form the vertical part of the "Q". Call the ab_drop() function with ab_drop('b13', 9).

3. Now, we can add the top part of the "Q" shape by stacking a b31 block horizontally. We need to drop the b31 block in slots 6, 7, and 8 at layer 3 to complete the "Q" shape. Call the ab_drop() function three times with the arguments ab_drop('b31', 6), ab_drop('b31', 7), and ab_drop('b31', 8) respectively.

4. Finally, we can drop two b31 blocks on top of the base block in slots 6 and 8 at layer 6 to create the arms of the "Q" shape. Call the ab_drop() function with ab_drop('b31', 6) and ab_drop('b31', 8).

After executing these steps, the structure will have a stable configuration that looks like the character "Q" and satisfies all the constraints.
