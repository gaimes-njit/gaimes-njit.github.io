To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Y" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps while considering the given constraints:

1. Drop the base of the "Y" structure: Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop a horizontal block (`b31`) at the center slot (slot number 10) of the base layer (layer 0). This will form the horizontal line of the "Y" shape.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

2. Drop the left leg of the "Y" structure: Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop a vertical block (`b13`) at the center slot (slot number 5) of a layer above the base layer. This will form the left leg of the "Y" shape.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

3. Drop the right leg of the "Y" structure: Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop a vertical block (`b13`) at the center slot (slot number 15) of the same layer as the left leg. This will form the right leg of the "Y" shape.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 15)
```

By following these steps, you will end up with a stable structure that looks like the character "Y" and satisfies the given constraints.
