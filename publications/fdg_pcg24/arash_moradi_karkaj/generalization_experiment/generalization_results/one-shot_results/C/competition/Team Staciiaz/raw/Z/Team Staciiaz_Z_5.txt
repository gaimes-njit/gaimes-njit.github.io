To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Z" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a specific order and position.

First, we need to determine the dropping positions for each block to ensure stability. We want to start dropping the blocks from the bottom layer upwards, and for each block, place it in a position that will distribute the weight evenly across the structure.

Based on the given constraints and block types, we can choose the following dropping positions:

1. Drop a b31 block at slot 7. This will be the bottom part of the "Z" shape.
   `ab_drop('b31', 7)`

2. Drop a b11 block at slot 6, above the b31 block. This will be the middle part of the "Z" shape.
   `ab_drop('b11', 6)`

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 5, above the b11 block. This will be the top part of the "Z" shape.
   `ab_drop('b13', 5)`

After executing these three `ab_drop()` function calls, the structure will contain the stable "Z" shape where each block is properly positioned and stacked.

To ensure no boundary intrusion, we have chosen dropping positions within the bounds of the map (slots 0 to 19), so there will be no intrusion regions.

The complete code to generate the stable "Z" structure is as follows:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # Function implementation goes here

# Drop a b31 block at slot 7
ab_drop('b31', 7)

# Drop a b11 block at slot 6
ab_drop('b11', 6)

# Drop a b13 block at slot 5
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Executing this code will generate the stable structure that looks like the character "Z" and satisfies all the given constraints.
