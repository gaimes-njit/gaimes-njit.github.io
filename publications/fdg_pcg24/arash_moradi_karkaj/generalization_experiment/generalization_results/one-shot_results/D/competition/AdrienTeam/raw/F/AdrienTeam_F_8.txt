To create a stable structure resembling "F" while adhering to the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the map structure using the provided code:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Next, drop the first block, which will be a vertical block. We can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block vertically from the H-1 layer, aligning its center with slot 8:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 8)
   ```

3. Now, we need to position the horizontal block for the top part of the "F". We will drop it in slots 8, 9, and 10. Since we can't use `ab_drop('b31', 0)`, we'll use a combination of `ab_drop('b11', x)` and `ab_drop('b11', x+1)` to achieve the same effect:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 8)
   ab_drop('b11', 9)
   ab_drop('b11', 10)
   ```

4. Finally, we need to position the vertical block for the vertical part of the "F". We'll drop it in slots 10 and 11 using two `ab_drop('b11', x)` calls:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 10)
   ab_drop('b11', 11)
   ```

The complete code block for generating the "F" structure while satisfying all the given constraints is as follows:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

This code block will generate the desired "F" structure in a stable manner, ensuring that all the constraints are met.
