To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "H" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` variable provided in the question.

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the center slot. This will act as the vertical part of the "H". Call `ab_drop('b31', 9)` to drop the b31 block.

3. Next, drop two b13 blocks on either side of the b31 block to complete the horizontal part of the "H". Call `ab_drop('b13', 7)` to drop the left b13 block and `ab_drop('b13', 11)` to drop the right b13 block.

4. Finally, drop a b11 block on top of the b31 block to connect the two horizontal parts of the "H". Call `ab_drop('b11', 9)` to drop the b11 block.

5. After following these steps, you should have a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "H".

Here is the code to generate the "H" structure:

```python
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the b31 block at the center
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the b13 blocks on either side
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 11)

# Drop the b11 block on top
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

Please note that this code only generates the "H" structure once. To generate diverse structures that resemble the "H" character, you can experiment with different combinations of dropping positions and orders.
