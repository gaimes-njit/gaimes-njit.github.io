To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "S" and meets all the hard constraints, the following steps can be followed:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid: structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Determine the placement of the blocks using the ab_drop() function, while considering the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

3. Start by dropping the b11 block at the bottom-left corner of the structure: ab_drop('b11', 0)

4. Drop the b13 block above the b11 block, aligned with its center: ab_drop('b13', 0)

5. Drop another b11 block to the right of the previous b11 block, aligned with its center: ab_drop('b11', 1)

6. Drop the b31 block above the previous b11 block, with its center aligned with the center of the b13 block: ab_drop('b31', 1)

7. Drop a b11 block to the right of the previous b31 block, aligned with its center: ab_drop('b11', 2)

8. Drop another b13 block above the previous b11 block, aligned with its center: ab_drop('b13', 2)

9. Repeat steps 5-8 to create the second half of the "S" shape. Drop b11, b31, and b13 blocks alternatively.

10. Once the structure is complete, check if it meets the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

11. If the stability constraints are violated, adjust the block placements to ensure stability.

12. If possible, make sure that the generated structure is diverse and not always the same by introducing randomness in the placement of the blocks.

Note: The specific coordinates for the ab_drop function will depend on the current state of the structure, including previously dropped blocks and support structures. The exact adjustments required to ensure stability may need to be determined through trial and error.
