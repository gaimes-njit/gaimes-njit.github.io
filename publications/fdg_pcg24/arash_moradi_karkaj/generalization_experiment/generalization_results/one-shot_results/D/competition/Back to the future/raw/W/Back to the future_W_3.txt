To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "W" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a way that satisfies the stability constraint and creates a structure similar to the uppercase letter "W".

3. Start building the base of the "W" by dropping a b31 block at slot 8 (assuming W = 20):

```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

This block will land on layer 0 and provide a stable foundation for the rest of the structure.

4. Drop two b13 blocks on top of the base, one at slot 6 and another at slot 10:

```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

These blocks will form the outer edges of the "W".

5. Drop another b31 block on top of the previous b31 block, at slot 14:

```
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

This block will connect the outer edges and complete the top part of the "W".

6. Drop a b11 block on top of the middle slot of the top b31 block, at slot 14:

```
ab_drop('b11', 14)
```

This block will form the middle part of the "W".

7. Drop a b11 block on top of the left outer edge, at slot 6:

```
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

This block will add a small bar to the left side of the structure, making it resemble the uppercase letter "W".

8. Drop a b11 block on top of the right outer edge, at slot 10:

```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

This block will add a small bar to the right side of the structure, completing the resemblance to the letter "W".

9. Check the stability of the structure after each block drop to ensure that it remains stable.

10. Repeat steps 3-9 multiple times, changing the slot positions of the blocks and the block types to create diverse and varied structures that resemble the letter "W".

Note: The exact coordinates for each block drop will depend on the actual values of W and H, so adjust the slot numbers accordingly.
