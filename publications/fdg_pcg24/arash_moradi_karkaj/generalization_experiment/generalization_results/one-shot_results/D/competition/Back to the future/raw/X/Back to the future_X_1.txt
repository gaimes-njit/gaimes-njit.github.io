To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "X" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the block-stacking problem techniques and use the `ab_drop()` function.

Here is an approach to generate the structure:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the bottom b31 block at the center slot 9 using the `ab_drop()` function:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

3. Drop the top-left b11 block at slot 8 to provide support for the upper part of the structure:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 8)
   ```

4. Drop the top-right b11 block at slot 10 to provide support for the upper part of the structure:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 10)
   ```

5. Drop the top b13 block at the center slot 9 to complete the structure:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

By following this sequence of `ab_drop()` calls, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "X" and meets all the hard constraints.

Note: The exact positions and order of the `ab_drop()` calls may vary depending on the specific requirements of the stability and shape constraints. Adjustments may be necessary to ensure stability and meet the desired shape.
