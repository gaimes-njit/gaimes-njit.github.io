Here is a possible solution for generating a stable structure resembling the letter "K":

ab_drop('b13', 6)   # Drop vertical block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 6)   # Drop vertical block at position 6
ab_drop('b11', 6)   # Drop square block at position 6
ab_drop('b31', 6)   # Drop horizontal block at position 6
ab_drop('b31', 9)   # Drop horizontal block at position 9
ab_drop('b13', 6)   # Drop vertical block at position 6

This solution creates a stable structure that looks like the letter "K" using a combination of vertical and horizontal blocks. The blocks are dropped in a specific order and position to achieve the desired shape.
