First, let's initialize the map:

```python
map = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

Since the letter "B" consists of two vertical bricks stacked together, we can start by placing the b13 brick and then stacking the b11 brick on top of it.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the b13 brick with x_position = 5
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place the b11 brick on top with x_position = 5
```

After executing the above code, the cells (5,0), (5,1), and (5,2) will be occupied by the b13 brick, and the cell (5,3) will be occupied by the b11 brick.

Next, let's place the b31 brick to form the lower part of the letter "B". Since the b13 and b11 bricks are already placed, we need to ensure stability by checking the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot. In this case, the pivot is the cell (5,3). We need to check the cells (4,3) and (6,3).

To ensure stability, let's first check if the cells (4,3) and (6,3) are occupied. If they are not occupied, we can safely place the b31 brick.

```python
if map[3][4] == 0 and map[3][6] == 0:
    ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the b31 brick with x_position = 5
```

After executing the above code, the cells (4,3), (5,3), and (6,3) will be occupied by the b31 brick, completing the shape resembling the letter "B".

The final code to generate the required structure with stability and boundary collision avoidance:

```python
map = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 5)

if map[3][4] == 0 and map[3][6] == 0:
    ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

Note: This code assumes that the ab_drop() function handles stability and boundary collision avoidance internally.
