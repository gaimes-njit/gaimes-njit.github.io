To create the structure "Y" inside a 20*16 box using only `ab_drop('blocktype', x position)`, we need to carefully position and drop the blocks in the correct locations. Here is the solution:

1. Drop a b11 block at position (9, 0).
2. Drop a b11 block at position (8, 1).
3. Drop a b11 block at position (10, 1).
4. Drop a b13 block at position (7, 2).
5. Drop a b13 block at position (11, 2).
6. Drop a b13 block at position (6, 3).
7. Drop a b31 block at position (5, 6).
8. Drop a b31 block at position (9, 6).
9. Drop a b31 block at position (13, 6).

The resulting structure will look like this:

```
####################
#                  #
#                  #
#                  #
#                  #
#                  #
#####            ###
    #####      #####
        ########
        ########
        ########
            #
            #
            #
            #
```

Note: The above representation assumes that '#' represents a 1*1 block (b11) and each line corresponds to one row of the box.
