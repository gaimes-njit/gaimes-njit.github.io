To create the letter "Z" inside a 20*16 box using the ab_drop('blocktype',x position) command, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a b31 block at position 0.
   ab_drop('b31', 0)

2. Drop a b13 block at position 2 to create the diagonal line of the "Z".
   ab_drop('b13', 2)

3. Drop another b31 block at position 6 to create the horizontal line of the "Z".
   ab_drop('b31', 6)

4. Finally, drop a b11 block at position 6 to complete the letter "Z".
   ab_drop('b11', 6)

The resulting structure will look like the letter "Z" inside the 20*16 box.
