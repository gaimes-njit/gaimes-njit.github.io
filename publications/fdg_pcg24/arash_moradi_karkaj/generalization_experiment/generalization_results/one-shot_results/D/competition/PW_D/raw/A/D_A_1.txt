To generate the uppercase English letter "A", you will need to follow the instructions below:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1, 1): `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position (0, 2): `ab_drop('b13', 0)`
3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position (2, 2): `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1, 3): `ab_drop('b31', 1)`

Note: The top left corner of the grid is considered as position (1, 1), and it increases along the width and height.
