To generate the uppercase letter "A" using the given block types and commands, you need to carefully place each block in the correct position. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "A":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at x=1
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Place the first vertical straight block at x=0
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical straight block at x=2
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the second horizontal straight block at x=1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the third horizontal straight block at x=1
```

By following these commands, you will create the letter "A" in the Tetris-like environment.
