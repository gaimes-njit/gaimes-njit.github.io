To generate the uppercase letter "B" in the defined environment, we need to carefully stack and position the block types according to their orientations. Here are the commands to create the letter "B":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 0)  // Place the first vertical straight block at position 0
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Place the second vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Place the second horizontal straight block at position 1
```

By executing these commands consecutively, the blocks will be stacked and positioned correctly to form the letter "B" within the specified boundaries of the environment.
