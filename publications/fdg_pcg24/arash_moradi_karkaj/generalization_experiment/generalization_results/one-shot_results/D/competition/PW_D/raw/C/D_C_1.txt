To generate the uppercase letter "C", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "C" by stacking the block types in the defined environment according to the gravity rules.
