To generate the uppercase letter "C", you can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

These commands will place the block types in the specified positions to form the letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries.
