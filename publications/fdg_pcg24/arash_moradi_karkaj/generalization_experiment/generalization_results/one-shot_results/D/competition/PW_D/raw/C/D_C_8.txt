To generate the uppercase letter "C", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
- Then, we place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 0 and 2.
- Next, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to complete the shape of the letter "C".
- Finally, we reinforce the bottom of the letter "C" by placing three additional horizontal blocks (b31) at position 1, and two vertical blocks (b13) at positions 0 and 2.

This set of commands will create a stable and accurately represented uppercase letter "C" within the given boundaries.
