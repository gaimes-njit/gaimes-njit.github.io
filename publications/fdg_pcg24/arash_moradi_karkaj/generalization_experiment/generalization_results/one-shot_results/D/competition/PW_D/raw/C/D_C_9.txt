To generate the uppercase English letter "C", you can use the following set of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1 to form the top part of the "C".
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13', 0)` places a vertical straight block at position 0 to form the left side of the "C".
3. The third command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places a vertical straight block at position 2 to form the right side of the "C".
4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places another horizontal straight block at position 1 to form the bottom part of the "C".
5. The fifth command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places an additional horizontal straight block at position 1 to stabilize the structure and complete the "C" shape.

Please note that the commands should be executed consecutively and in the given order for the final shape to resemble the uppercase letter "C".
