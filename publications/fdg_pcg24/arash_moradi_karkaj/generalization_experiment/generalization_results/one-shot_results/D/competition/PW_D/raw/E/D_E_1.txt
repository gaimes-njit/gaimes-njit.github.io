To generate the uppercase letter "E" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (block type b31) at position (1, 1):
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (block type b13) at position (0, 2):
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (block type b13) at position (2, 2):
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Place another horizontal straight block (block type b31) at position (1, 3):
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

By following these steps, we can construct the uppercase letter "E" within the allowed space boundaries.
