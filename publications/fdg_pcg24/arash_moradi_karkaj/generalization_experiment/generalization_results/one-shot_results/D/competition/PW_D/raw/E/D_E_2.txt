To generate the uppercase letter "E", we can use the following sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

This sequence of commands will stack the blocks in the shape of the letter "E", ensuring structural stability and following the gravity rules.
