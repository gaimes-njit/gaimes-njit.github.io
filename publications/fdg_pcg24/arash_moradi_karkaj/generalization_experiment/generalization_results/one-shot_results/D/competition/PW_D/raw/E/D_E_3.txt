To generate the uppercase letter "E" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical block (b13) at position 0.
3. Place another vertical block (b13) at position 2.
4. Place another horizontal block (b31) at position 1.

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "E":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
