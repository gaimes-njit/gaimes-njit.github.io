To generate the uppercase letter "E", you can follow these steps:

1. Place the first block, which is a horizontal straight block (b31), at position 1: `ab_drop('b31',1)`.
2. Place the second block, which is a vertical straight block (b13), at position 0: `ab_drop('b13',0)`.
3. Place the third block, which is another vertical straight block (b13), at position 2: `ab_drop('b13',2)`.
4. Place the fourth block, which is again a horizontal straight block (b31), at position 1: `ab_drop('b31',1)`.

So the complete stream of commands to generate the letter "E" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```
