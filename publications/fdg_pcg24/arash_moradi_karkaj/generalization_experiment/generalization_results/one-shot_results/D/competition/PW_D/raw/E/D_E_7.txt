To generate the uppercase letter "E", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

Explanation:
1. The first `ab_drop('b31',1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1, creating the first vertical stroke of the letter "E".
2. The second and third `ab_drop('b13',0)` and `ab_drop('b13',2)` place two vertical straight blocks at positions 0 and 2, creating the top horizontal stroke of the letter "E".
3. The fourth `ab_drop('b31',1)` places another horizontal straight block at position 1, creating the middle horizontal stroke of the letter "E".
4. The fifth and sixth `ab_drop('b13',0)` and `ab_drop('b13',2)` place two vertical straight blocks at positions 0 and 2, creating the bottom horizontal stroke of the letter "E".
5. The seventh, eighth, and ninth `ab_drop('b31',1)`, `ab_drop('b13',0)`, and `ab_drop('b13',2)` repeat the steps for the top and bottom horizontal strokes of the letter "E" to ensure structural stability.

By following these commands, the blocks will stack up and form the capital letter "E" in the Tetris-like environment while adhering to the gravity rules.
