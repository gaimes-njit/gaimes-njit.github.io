To create the letter E, we can use the following ab_drop commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Explanation:
- First, we create the top horizontal line of the letter E using the b31 block type at position 1.
- Then, we create the vertical line of the letter E using two b13 block types at positions 0 and 2.
- After that, we create the bottom horizontal line of the letter E using the b31 block type at position 1.
- Lastly, we create the middle horizontal line of the letter E using the b13 block type at position 1.

Note: The commands should be executed consecutively and in the given order to accurately create the letter E.
