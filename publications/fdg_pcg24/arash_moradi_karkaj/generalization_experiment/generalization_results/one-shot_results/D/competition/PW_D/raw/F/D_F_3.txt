To generate the uppercase letter "F", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit at position 1.
- The second command `ab_drop('b13', 0)` places a vertical straight block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units at position 0.
- The third command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units at position 2.
- The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places another horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit at position 1.

These commands will generate the uppercase letter "F" within the allowed space and following the gravity rules.
