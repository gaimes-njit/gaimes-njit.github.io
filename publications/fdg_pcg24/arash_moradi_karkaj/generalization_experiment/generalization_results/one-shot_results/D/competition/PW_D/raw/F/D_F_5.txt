To generate the uppercase letter "F" using the given block types and commands, we need to plan and execute the sequence of ab_drop() commands in a way that resembles the letter F while ensuring stability according to the gravity rules.

Here is the sequence of commands to generate the letter "F":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',0)  # Place the vertical block at position 0
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal block at position 1 (overlap with previous horizontal block)
```

These commands construct the letter "F" with the first horizontal block forming the top bar, the two vertical blocks forming the middle bar, and the second horizontal block forming the bottom bar.

Please note that you need to execute these commands consecutively, one after another, in the specified order to construct the "F" shape accurately within the defined environment.
