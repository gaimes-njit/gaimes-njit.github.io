To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a horizontal straight block of width 3 units (b31) at position 1.
- Then, we place a vertical straight block of height 3 units (b13) at position 0.
- Next, we place another vertical straight block of height 3 units (b13) at position 2.
- Finally, we place another horizontal straight block of width 3 units (b31) at position 1.

These commands will create the shape of the letter "F" within the allowed space boundaries and in adherence to the gravity rules.
