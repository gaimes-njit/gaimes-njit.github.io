To generate the uppercase letter "F", we need to place the blocks in a specific pattern. Here is a stream of ab_drop() commands that resemble the target letter "F" in the defined environment:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 0)   # Place the vertical block at position 0
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "F" within the allowed space boundaries while following the gravity rules.
