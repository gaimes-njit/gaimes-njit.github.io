To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block (b31) at the position 1 on the width.
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places a vertical straight block (b13) at the position 1 on the width, right below the first block.
3. The third command `ab_drop('b13', 0)` places another vertical straight block (b13) at the position 0 on the width, to the left of the first block.
4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places a vertical straight block (b13) at the position 2 on the width, to the right of the first block.

By following these commands, the blocks should stack on top of each other and resemble the uppercase letter "F" within the defined environment.
