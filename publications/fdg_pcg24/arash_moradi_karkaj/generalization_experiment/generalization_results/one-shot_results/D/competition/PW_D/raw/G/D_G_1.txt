To generate the uppercase letter "G", we can use the following set of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter "G" within the allowed space and abide by the gravity rules.
