To generate the uppercase letter "G", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 0)   # Place the first vertical straight block at position 0
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the second vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 0)   # Place the third horizontal straight block at position 0
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place the fourth horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Place the square block to complete the letter "G"
```
