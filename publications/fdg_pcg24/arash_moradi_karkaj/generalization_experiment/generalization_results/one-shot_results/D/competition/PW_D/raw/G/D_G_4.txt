To generate the uppercase letter "G" in the defined environment, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  -> Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 1)  -> Place a square block on top of the previous block
ab_drop('b11', 2)  -> Place another square block next to the previous one
ab_drop('b13', 2)  -> Place a vertical straight block on the right side of the previous blocks
ab_drop('b31', 3)  -> Place a horizontal straight block next to the vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 3)  -> Place a square block on top of the previous block
ab_drop('b11', 4)  -> Place another square block next to the previous one
ab_drop('b31', 4)  -> Place a horizontal straight block on top of the previous blocks
```
