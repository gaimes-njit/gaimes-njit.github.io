Here's how you can generate the uppercase English letter "G" using the ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
- Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1.
- Place another horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1.
- Place a third horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1.
- Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 2.
- Place a fourth horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1.
- Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 0.
- Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 2.
- Place a fifth horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1.

This sequence of commands will create the letter "G" in the Tetris-like environment while following the gravity rules and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
