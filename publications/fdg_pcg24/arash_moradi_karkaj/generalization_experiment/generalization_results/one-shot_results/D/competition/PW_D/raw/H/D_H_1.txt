To generate the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types, you need to stack and position the blocks in the following sequence:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1) # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 0) # Place a vertical straight block at position 0
ab_drop('b13', 2) # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1) # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries while following the gravity rules.
