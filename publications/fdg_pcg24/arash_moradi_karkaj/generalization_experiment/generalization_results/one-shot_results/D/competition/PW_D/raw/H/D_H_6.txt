To generate the uppercase letter "H", we can use the following stream of commands using the given block types:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. `ab_drop('b31', 1)`: This command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 along the width. This forms the top of the "H".
2. `ab_drop('b13', 0)`: This command places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0 along the width. This forms the left vertical line of the "H".
3. `ab_drop('b13', 2)`: This command places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 along the width. This forms the right vertical line of the "H".
4. `ab_drop('b31', 1)`: This command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 along the width. This forms the bottom of the "H".

By following these commands in order, the uppercase letter "H" will be generated in the Tetris-like environment, while maintaining stability and fitting within the boundaries.
