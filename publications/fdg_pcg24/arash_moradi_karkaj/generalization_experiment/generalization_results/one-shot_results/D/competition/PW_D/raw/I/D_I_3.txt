To create the uppercase English letter "I" in the defined environment, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

``` python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
3. Place another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
4. Place another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
5. Place another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
6. Place another horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1.
7. Place another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
8. Place another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
9. Place another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
10. Place another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
11. Place another horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1.

This sequence of commands will create the letter "I" in the defined environment, with the blocks stacked on top of each other to form the letter shape.
