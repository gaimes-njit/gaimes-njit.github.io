To generate the uppercase letter "I", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width.
2. The second command places a 1x1 square block (b11) directly on top of the previous block.
3. The third to fifth commands place three more vertical straight blocks (b13) on top, one above the other.

By following these commands, the letter "I" will be formed in the Tetris-like environment.
