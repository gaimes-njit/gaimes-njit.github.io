To generate the uppercase English letter "I", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

Explanation: 
- First, we drop the horizontal straight block 'b31' at position 1, which represents the top part of the letter "I".
- Then, we drop three vertical straight blocks 'b13' at position 1 consecutively, which represent the vertical part of the letter "I".

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase English letter "I" within the defined environment.
