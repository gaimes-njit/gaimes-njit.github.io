To generate the uppercase letter "J", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places a vertical straight block at position 1, which forms the downstroke of the letter "J".
- The second command `ab_drop('b13', 0)` places another vertical straight block at position 0, which forms the stem of the letter "J".
- The third command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units at position 2, which completes the top of the letter "J".
- The fourth, fifth, and sixth commands `ab_drop('b11', 1)` place three 1x1 square blocks at position 1 to give stability to the structure. These blocks act as a base for the letter "J".

By following these commands, you will create the uppercase letter "J" in the defined environment.
