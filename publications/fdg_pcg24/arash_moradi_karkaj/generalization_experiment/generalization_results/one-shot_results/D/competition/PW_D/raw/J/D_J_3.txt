To generate the uppercase letter "J", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will create a horizontal straight block at position 1, followed by two vertical straight blocks at positions 0 and 2, and finally another horizontal straight block at position 1. The resulting blocks will resemble the uppercase letter "J" within the defined environment.
