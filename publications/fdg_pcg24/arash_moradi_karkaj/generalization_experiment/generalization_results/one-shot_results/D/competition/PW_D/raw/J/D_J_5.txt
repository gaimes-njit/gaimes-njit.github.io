To generate the uppercase letter "J", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "J" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and fitting within the allowed space boundaries.
