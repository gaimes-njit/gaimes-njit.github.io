To generate the uppercase English letter "J", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block starting from position 1, making the top part of the "J".

The second command `ab_drop('b13', 0)` places a vertical straight block starting from position 0, making the left part of the "J".

The third command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block starting from position 2, making the right part of the "J".

The final command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places another horizontal straight block starting from position 1, completing the bottom part of the "J".
