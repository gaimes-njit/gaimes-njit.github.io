To generate the letter "K" using the provided block types in the defined environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Here's a breakdown of the commands:

1. `ab_drop('b31', 1)`:
   - This command places a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1, creating the top horizontal line of the letter "K".

2. `ab_drop('b13', 0)`:
   - This command places a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 0, creating the vertical line of the left side of the letter "K".

3. `ab_drop('b13', 2)`:
   - This command places a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 2, creating the vertical line of the right side of the letter "K".

4. `ab_drop('b31', 1)`:
   - This command places a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1, creating the bottom horizontal line of the letter "K".

By executing these commands consecutively, you will be able to generate the uppercase English letter "K" within the specified environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
