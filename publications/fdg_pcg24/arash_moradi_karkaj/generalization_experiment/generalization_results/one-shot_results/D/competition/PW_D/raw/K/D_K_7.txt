To generate the uppercase letter "K", we need to stack and arrange the block types in a specific way. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "K":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 0)   # Place the vertical block at position 0
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
```

By following these commands, you will be able to construct the uppercase letter "K" within the allowed space boundaries, considering the gravity rules.
