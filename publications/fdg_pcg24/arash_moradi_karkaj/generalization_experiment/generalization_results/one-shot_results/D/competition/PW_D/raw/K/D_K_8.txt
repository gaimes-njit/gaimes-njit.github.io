To create the uppercase letter "K", we can use the following set of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

These commands will first place a horizontal straight block at position 1, then two vertical straight blocks at positions 0 and 2, and finally another horizontal straight block at position 1. This arrangement will form the shape of the letter "K" within the allowed space and maintain structural stability.
