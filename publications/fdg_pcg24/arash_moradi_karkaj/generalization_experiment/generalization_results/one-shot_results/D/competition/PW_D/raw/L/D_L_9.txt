To create the uppercase English letter "L", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:

- `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places the horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units at position 1 along the width.
- `ab_drop('b13', 0)` places the vertical straight block with a height of 3 units at position 0 along the width.
- `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block with a height of 3 units at position 2 along the width.
- `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places another horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units at position 1 along the width.

By executing these commands in a Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules, the resulting structure will resemble the uppercase English letter "L".
