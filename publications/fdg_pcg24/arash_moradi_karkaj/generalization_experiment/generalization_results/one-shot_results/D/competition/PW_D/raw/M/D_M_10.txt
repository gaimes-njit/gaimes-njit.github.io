To generate the uppercase letter "M", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the first horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place the first vertical straight block (b13) to the left of the previous block: `ab_drop('b13', 0)`
3. Place the second vertical straight block (b13) to the right of the previous block: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
4. Place the second horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous blocks, centered between them: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`

The complete sequence of commands to generate the uppercase letter "M" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
