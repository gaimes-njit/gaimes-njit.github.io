To generate the uppercase letter "M", you would need to use the following commands:

ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)

These commands will place the blocks in the defined environment, respecting the gravity rules, and construct the letter "M".
