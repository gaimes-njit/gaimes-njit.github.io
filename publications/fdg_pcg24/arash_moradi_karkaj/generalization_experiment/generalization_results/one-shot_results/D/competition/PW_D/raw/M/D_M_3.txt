To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can break it down into smaller segments and stack them together using the block types provided. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "M":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command places a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 along the width. This forms the left side of the letter "M".
2. The second command places a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1. This connects to the bottom of the vertical block and extends to the right, forming the middle part of the letter "M".
3. The third command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2. This extends further to the right, connecting to the middle block.
4. The fourth command places another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3. This forms the right side of the letter "M".
5. The fifth command places a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2, above the previous horizontal block. This creates a bridge connecting the two sides of the letter "M".
6. The sixth command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3, above the previous horizontal block. This completes the bridge, forming the upper part of the letter "M".

By following these commands, you will be able to generate the uppercase English letter "M" within the specified environment and gravity rules.
