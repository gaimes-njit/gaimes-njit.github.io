To create the uppercase English letter "M," we can use a combination of block types b31 (horizontal straight block) and b13 (vertical straight block). Here are the commands to generate the "M" shape:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the following positions:
1. Place a b31 block at position 1.
2. Place a b13 block at position 0.
3. Place a b13 block at position 2.
4. Place another b31 block at position 1.

The resulting shape will resemble the uppercase English letter "M" within the allowed space boundaries.
