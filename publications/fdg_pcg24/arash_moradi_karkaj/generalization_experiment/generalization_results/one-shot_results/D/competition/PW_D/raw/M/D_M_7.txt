To generate the uppercase letter "M", we can use a combination of the block types b31 and b13. Here is the sequence of commands to construct the letter "M":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first block (b31) is placed at position 1 along the width, forming the left slant of the "M".
2. The next block (b13) is placed at position 0 along the width, forming the left vertical line of the "M".
3. The third block (b13) is placed at position 2 along the width, forming the right vertical line of the "M".
4. The final block (b31) is placed again at position 1 along the width, completing the right slant of the "M".

By following these instructions, the blocks will stack in the desired shape and form the uppercase letter "M".
