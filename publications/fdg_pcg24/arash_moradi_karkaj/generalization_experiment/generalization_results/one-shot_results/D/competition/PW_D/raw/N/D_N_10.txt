To generate the uppercase letter "N," you can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0: `ab_drop('b13', 0)`
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`

This set of commands will create the letter "N" in the Tetris-like environment.

Here is the complete stream of commands:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
