To create the uppercase letter "N", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block starting at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Place the vertical straight block starting at position 0
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block starting at position 2 
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block starting at position 1
```

By executing these commands consecutively, we will be able to construct the letter "N" in the given environment.
