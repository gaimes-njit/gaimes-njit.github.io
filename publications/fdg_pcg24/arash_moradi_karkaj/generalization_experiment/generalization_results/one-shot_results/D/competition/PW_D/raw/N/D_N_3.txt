To generate the uppercase English letter "N", the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands should be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence will create a letter "N" with the correct structural stability and adherence to the gravity rules.
