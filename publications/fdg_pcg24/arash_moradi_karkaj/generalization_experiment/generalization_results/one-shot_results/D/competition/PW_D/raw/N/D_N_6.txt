To generate the uppercase letter "N", we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
- Then, we place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 0, forming the left side of the letter "N".
- Next, we place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2, forming the right side of the letter "N".
- Finally, we place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 to complete the letter "N".

By following these ab_drop() commands in sequence, we can construct the uppercase letter "N" within the defined environment.
