To generate the uppercase letter "N", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
- Next, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0, followed by another vertical straight block at position 2.
- Lastly, we place another horizontal straight block at position 1 to complete the letter "N".
