To generate uppercase letter "N", we can follow the following steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position (1, 1).
2. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position (11, 1).
3. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position (11, 3).
4. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position (1, 5).

The stream of ab_drop() commands would be as follows:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
