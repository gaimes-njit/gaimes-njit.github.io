To generate the uppercase English letter "O", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the correct positions and form the letter "O" within the grid while adhering to the gravity rules.
