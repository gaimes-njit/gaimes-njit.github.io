To generate the uppercase letter "O", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence will create a "O" shape in the grid, using block types b31 and b13. The blocks will be placed consecutively, starting from position 1, to form the desired letter.
