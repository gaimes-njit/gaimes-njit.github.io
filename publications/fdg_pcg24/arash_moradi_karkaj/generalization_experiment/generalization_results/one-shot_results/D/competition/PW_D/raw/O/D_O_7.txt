To generate the uppercase English letter "O", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will create a letter "O" in the grid by stacking the blocks according to the gravity rules. Each command places a block of the specified type (`b31` or `b13`) at the specified position along the width.

Please note that the commands should be executed consecutively, one after the other.
