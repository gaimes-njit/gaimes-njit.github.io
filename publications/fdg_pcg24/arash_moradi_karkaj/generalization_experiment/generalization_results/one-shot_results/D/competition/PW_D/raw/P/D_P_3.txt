To generate the uppercase letter "P" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Explanation of each command:
1. `ab_drop('b31', 1)` - Place a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit at position 1.
2. `ab_drop('b13', 1)` - Place a vertical straight block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units at position 1.
3. `ab_drop('b13', 0)` - Place a vertical straight block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units at position 0.
4. `ab_drop('b31', 1)` - Place a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit at position 1.
5. `ab_drop('b11', 3)` - Place a 1x1 square block at position 3 to complete the letter "P".

By executing these commands consecutively in a Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules, the resulting blocks will form the uppercase letter "P".
