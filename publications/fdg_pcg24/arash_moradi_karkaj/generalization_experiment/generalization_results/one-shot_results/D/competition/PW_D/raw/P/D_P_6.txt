To create the letter "P" using the given block types and environment, the following stream of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

Explanation:
First, we place a horizontal straight block ('b31') starting at position 1 to create the top part of the letter.
Next, we place a vertical straight block ('b13') starting at position 1 to create the vertical line of the letter.
Then, we place three 1x1 square blocks ('b11') starting from position 2 to create the bottom part of the letter.
Finally, we place another vertical straight block ('b13') starting at position 4 to complete the shape of the letter "P".
