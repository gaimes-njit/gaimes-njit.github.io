To generate the uppercase letter "P" using the given block types and rules, you can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1,1) using the ab_drop('b31', 1) command. This will serve as the top part of the letter "P".

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position (0,1) using the ab_drop('b13', 0) command. This will serve as the left part of the letter "P".

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position (2,1) using the ab_drop('b13', 2) command. This will serve as the right part of the letter "P".

4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1,2) using the ab_drop('b31', 1) command. This will serve as the bottom part of the letter "P".

Here is the stream of commands:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
