To create the uppercase letter "Q," we can use the following stream of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "Q" in the Tetris-like environment, following the stacking and stability rules.
