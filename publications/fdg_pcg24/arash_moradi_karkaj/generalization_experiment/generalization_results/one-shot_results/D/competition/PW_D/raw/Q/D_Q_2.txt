To generate the uppercase letter "Q", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Explanation:

- The first `ab_drop('b31', 1)` command places a horizontal straight block at position 1.
- The next three `ab_drop('b13', 0)` and `ab_drop('b13', 2)` commands place vertical straight blocks at positions 0 and 2.
- The next two `ab_drop('b31', 1)` commands place horizontal straight blocks overlapping the previous ones at position 1.
- The following three `ab_drop('b13', 2)` and `ab_drop('b13', 0)` commands place vertical straight blocks overlapping the previous ones at positions 2 and 0.
- The next `ab_drop('b31', 1)` command places a horizontal straight block overlapping the previous ones at position 1.
- The final `ab_drop('b13', 0)`, `ab_drop('b13', 2)`, and `ab_drop('b13', 1)` commands place three vertical straight blocks overlapping the previous ones at positions 0, 2, and 1.

This sequence of commands will create the letter "Q" within the defined environment using the given block types and gravity rules.
