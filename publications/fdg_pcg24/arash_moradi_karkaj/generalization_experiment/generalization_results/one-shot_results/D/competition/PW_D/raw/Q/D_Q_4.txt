To generate the uppercase letter "Q" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0.
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2.
4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "Q":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```
