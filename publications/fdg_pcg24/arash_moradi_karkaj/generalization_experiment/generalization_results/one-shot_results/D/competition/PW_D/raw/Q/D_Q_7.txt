To generate the uppercase letter "Q", we need to follow the guidelines mentioned in the task. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "Q":

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place a horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)    # Place a vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place a horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 2)    # Place a square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)    # Place a square block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "Q" in the Tetris-like environment.
