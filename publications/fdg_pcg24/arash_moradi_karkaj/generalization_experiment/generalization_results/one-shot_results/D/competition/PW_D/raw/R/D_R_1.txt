To generate the uppercase letter "R", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1,1):
```
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position (1,2):
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position (1,3):
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1,4):
```
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

The above sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "R" in the Tetris-like environment.
