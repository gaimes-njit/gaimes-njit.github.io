To generate the uppercase letter "R", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter "R" within the allowed space boundaries, while also ensuring stability according to the gravity rules.
