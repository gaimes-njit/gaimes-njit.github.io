To generate the uppercase English letter "R", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b11',0)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by dropping a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0 to form the left leg of the letter "R".
3. Drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 to form the right leg of the letter "R".
4. Drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to connect the legs and complete the letter "R".
5. To add the diagonal top of the letter "R", drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
6. Drop a single square block (b11) at position 0 to close the top of the letter "R".
7. Drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to extend the top of the letter "R".
8. Drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 to complete the letter "R".

By following these steps, you will generate the uppercase English letter "R" in the given Tetris-like environment.
