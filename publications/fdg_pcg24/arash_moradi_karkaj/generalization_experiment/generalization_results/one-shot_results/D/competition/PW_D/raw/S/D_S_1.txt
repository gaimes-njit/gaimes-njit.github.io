To generate the uppercase English letter "S", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

This will construct the letter "S" within the defined environment, following the stacking and stability rules.
