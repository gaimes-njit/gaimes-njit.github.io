To generate the uppercase letter "S", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',0)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

These commands will sequentially place blocks in the Tetris-like environment to form the shape of the letter "S" while ensuring structural stability and following the gravity rules.
