To generate the uppercase letter "S", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place the second vertical straight block at position 0: `ab_drop('b13', 0)`
3. Place the third vertical straight block at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
4. Place the second horizontal straight block at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "S" would be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
