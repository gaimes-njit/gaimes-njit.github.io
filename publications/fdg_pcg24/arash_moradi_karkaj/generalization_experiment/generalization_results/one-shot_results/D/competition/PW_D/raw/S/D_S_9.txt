To generate the uppercase English letter "S", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter "S" within the allowed space boundaries.
