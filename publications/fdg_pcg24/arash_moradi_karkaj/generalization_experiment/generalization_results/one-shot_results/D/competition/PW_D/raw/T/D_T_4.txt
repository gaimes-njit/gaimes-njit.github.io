To generate the uppercase letter "T", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

This sequence will first place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, then a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 0 and 2, and finally another horizontal straight block at position 1. These blocks will form the shape of the letter "T" within the allowed space boundaries.
