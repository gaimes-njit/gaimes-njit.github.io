To generate the uppercase English letter "T", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

Explanation of the sequence:
1. The first command places a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 8 on the width.
2. The second command places a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 7 on the width.
3. The third command places a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 9 on the width.
4. Lastly, the fourth command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 8 on the width, completing the letter "T".

This sequence of commands ensures that the blocks are stacked in a stable manner, following the gravity rules, and the resulting shape represents the uppercase English letter "T" within the allowed space boundaries.
