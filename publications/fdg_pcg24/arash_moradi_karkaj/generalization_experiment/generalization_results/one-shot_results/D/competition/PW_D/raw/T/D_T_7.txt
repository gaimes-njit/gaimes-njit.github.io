To generate the uppercase English letter "T", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

These commands will place the blocks in such a way that they resemble the letter "T" within the defined boundaries and gravity rules.
