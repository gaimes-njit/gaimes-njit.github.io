To generate the uppercase English letter "U", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:

1. The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block (b31) with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit at position 1.
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13', 0)` places a vertical straight block (b13) with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units at position 0.
3. The third command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2.
4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to complete the shape of the letter "U".

By following these instructions, you should be able to generate the uppercase letter "U" within the allowed space boundaries.
