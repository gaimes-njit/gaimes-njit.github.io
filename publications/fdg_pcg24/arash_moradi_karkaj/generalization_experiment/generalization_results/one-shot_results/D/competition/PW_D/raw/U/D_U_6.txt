To generate the uppercase English letter "U", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
- The first `ab_drop('b31', 1)` command places a horizontal straight block of width 3 (b31) at position 1 along the width of the grid.
- The second `ab_drop('b13', 0)` command places a vertical straight block of height 3 (b13) at position 0 along the width of the grid.
- The third `ab_drop('b13', 2)` command places another vertical straight block of height 3 (b13) at position 2 along the width of the grid.
- The fourth `ab_drop('b31', 1)` command places another horizontal straight block of width 3 (b31) at position 1 along the width of the grid.

When executed in this order, these commands will result in the uppercase letter "U" in the defined Tetris-like environment.
