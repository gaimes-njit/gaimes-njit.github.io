To generate the uppercase English letter "U", we can follow these steps:

1. Drop a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0.
3. Drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2.
4. Drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "U":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
