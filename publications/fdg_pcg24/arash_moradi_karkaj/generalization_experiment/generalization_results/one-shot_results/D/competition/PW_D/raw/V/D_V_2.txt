To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can use a combination of horizontal and vertical straight blocks. Here is the series of ab_drop() commands to construct the letter "V":

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, followed by two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 0 and 2, and finally another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. The resulting shape will resemble the letter "V".

Remember to execute the commands consecutively, and ensure that the blocks are placed within the allowed space boundaries and maintain stability according to the gravity rules.
