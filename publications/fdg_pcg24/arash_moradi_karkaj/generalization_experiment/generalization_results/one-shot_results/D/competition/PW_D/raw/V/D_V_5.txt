To generate the uppercase letter "V" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 along the width.
2. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3.
3. Place the last horizontal straight block (b31) at position 5.
4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0.
5. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 6.

These commands will create the uppercase letter "V" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
