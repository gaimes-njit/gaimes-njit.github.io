To generate the uppercase letter "V", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command, ab_drop('b31', 1), places a horizontal straight block at position 1, creating the top of the "V".
2. The second command, ab_drop('b13', 0), places a vertical straight block at position 0, extending downwards from the left side of the "V".
3. The third command, ab_drop('b13', 2), places another vertical straight block at position 2, extending downwards from the right side of the "V".
4. The fourth command, ab_drop('b31', 1), places another horizontal straight block at position 1, creating the bottom of the "V".
