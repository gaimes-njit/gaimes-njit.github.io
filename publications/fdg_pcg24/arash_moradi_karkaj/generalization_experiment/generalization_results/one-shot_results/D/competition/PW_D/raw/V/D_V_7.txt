To generate the uppercase letter "V", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "V" by stacking the block types in the defined environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
