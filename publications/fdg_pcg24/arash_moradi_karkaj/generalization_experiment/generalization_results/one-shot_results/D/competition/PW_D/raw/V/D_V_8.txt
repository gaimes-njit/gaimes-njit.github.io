To generate the letter "V", use the following ab_drop() commands:

1. ab_drop('b31', 1) - Place the horizontal straight block at position 1.
2. ab_drop('b13', 0) - Place the vertical straight block at position 0.
3. ab_drop('b13', 2) - Place the vertical straight block at position 2.
4. ab_drop('b31', 1) - Place the horizontal straight block at position 1.

This sequence of commands will construct a capital letter "V" within the specified boundaries and gravity rules.
