To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we can start by placing two b13 blocks vertically at positions 1 and 3. Then, we can place a b31 block horizontally at position 2.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop commands to generate the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```
