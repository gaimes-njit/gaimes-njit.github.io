To generate the uppercase letter "W", we need to strategically place the block types in the Tetris-like environment.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to construct the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Then, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 6.
3. Next, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
4. After that, we place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 4.
5. Then, we place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 7.
6. Finally, we place the last vertical straight block (b13) at position 10.

By following these sequence of commands, we can construct the uppercase letter "W" within the defined environment.
