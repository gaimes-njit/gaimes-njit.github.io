To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we can use a combination of block types b31 and b13. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 15)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "W" within the defined environment and with consideration for stacking and stability.
