To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we can break it down into multiple block placements. Here is a stream of ab_drop() commands that resemble the target letter:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Place the first vertical straight block at position 0
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the third vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place the fourth vertical straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the third horizontal straight block at position 7
```

This will construct the letter "W" using the given block types and following the gravity rules in the defined environment.
