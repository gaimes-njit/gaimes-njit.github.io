To create the letter "X" using the provided block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal block of width 3 (b31) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical block of height 3 (b13) at position 0.
3. Place another vertical block of height 3 (b13) at position 2.
4. Place another horizontal block of width 3 (b31) at position 1.

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands that resemble the target letter "X":
