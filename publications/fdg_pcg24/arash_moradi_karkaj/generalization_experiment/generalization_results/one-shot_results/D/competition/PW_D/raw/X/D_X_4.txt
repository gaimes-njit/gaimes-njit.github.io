To generate the uppercase English letter "X" using the ab_drop() commands, we need to stack and position the block types in a specific pattern. Here is the sequence of commands to create the letter "X":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',0)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command places a horizontal straight block 'b31' at position 1 along the width.
2. The second command places a vertical straight block 'b13' at position 0 along the width.
3. The third command places another vertical straight block 'b13' at position 2 along the width.
4. The final command places another horizontal straight block 'b31' at position 1 along the width.

By following these commands, you will generate the uppercase English letter "X" in the Tetris-like environment.
