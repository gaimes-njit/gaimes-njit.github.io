To generate the uppercase letter "X", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence creates the letter "X" by stacking the block types in the specified positions. The first command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. The second and third commands stack two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 0 and 2, respectively. Finally, the fourth command places another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to complete the letter "X".

Please note that this is just one example of how to generate the letter "X" using the specified block types. There may be other valid sequences of commands that can achieve the same result.
