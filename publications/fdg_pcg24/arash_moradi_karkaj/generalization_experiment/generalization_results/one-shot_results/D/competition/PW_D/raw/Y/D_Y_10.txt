To generate the uppercase English letter "Y," we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 0)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 0
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
```

These commands will create a "Y" shape on the grid, following the stacking and stability rules.
