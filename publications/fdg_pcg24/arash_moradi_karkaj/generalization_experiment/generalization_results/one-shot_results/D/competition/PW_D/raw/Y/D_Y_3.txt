To create the uppercase letter "Y", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 (b31) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block of height 3 (b13) at position 1.
3. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 1.
4. Place a vertical straight block of height 3 (b13) at position 3.
5. Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 (b31) at position 1.

The resulting shape will resemble the uppercase letter "Y" within the grid boundaries and adhere to the gravity rules.
