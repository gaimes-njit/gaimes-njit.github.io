To generate the uppercase letter "Y", you can use the following commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at x=1
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Place a vertical straight block at x=0
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at x=2
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at x=1
```

These commands will create the shape of the letter "Y" in the defined environment, following the gravity rules.
