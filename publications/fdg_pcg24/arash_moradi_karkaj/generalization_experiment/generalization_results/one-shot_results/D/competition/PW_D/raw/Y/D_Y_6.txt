To generate the uppercase letter "Y", we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

Explanation:
- The first ab_drop('b31', 1) command places a horizontal straight block at position 1, creating the top of the letter "Y".
- The second ab_drop('b13', 0) command places a vertical straight block at position 0, creating the left stem of the letter "Y".
- The third ab_drop('b31', 1) command places another horizontal straight block at position 1, connecting the left stem to the top of the letter "Y".
- The fourth ab_drop('b13', 2) command places another vertical straight block at position 2, creating the right stem of the letter "Y".
- The fifth ab_drop('b11', 1) command places a square block at position 1, filling the gap between the two stems of the letter "Y".
- The sixth and final ab_drop('b11', 1) command places another square block at position 1, further stabilizing the structure of the letter "Y".

By following this sequence of commands, the uppercase letter "Y" can be generated in the Tetris-like environment.
