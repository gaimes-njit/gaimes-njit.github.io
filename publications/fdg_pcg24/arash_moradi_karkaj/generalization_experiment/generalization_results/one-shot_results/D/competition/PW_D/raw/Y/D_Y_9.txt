To create the uppercase letter "Y" in the Tetris-like environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will place the block types in a way that accurately represents the letter "Y" and follows the gravity rules defined in the environment.
