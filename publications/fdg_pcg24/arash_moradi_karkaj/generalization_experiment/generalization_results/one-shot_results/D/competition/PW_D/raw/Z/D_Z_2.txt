To generate the uppercase letter "Z", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. This forms the top part of the letter "Z".
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 0. This forms the diagonal line of the letter "Z".
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2. This completes the diagonal line of the letter "Z".
4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. This forms the bottom part of the letter "Z".

By following these instructions, you will generate the uppercase letter "Z" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring stability with regard to the gravity rules.
