To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by dropping a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
2. Next, we drop a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 0 and another one at position 2.
3. Finally, we drop another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.

This sequence of commands will create the letter "Z" in the Tetris-like environment with the given gravity rules.
