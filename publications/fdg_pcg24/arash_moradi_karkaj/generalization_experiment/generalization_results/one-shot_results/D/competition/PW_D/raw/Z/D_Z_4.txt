To generate the uppercase English letter "Z" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

These commands will first place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1. Then, a vertical straight block (`b13`) will be placed at positions 0 and 2. Finally, another horizontal straight block (`b31`) will be placed at position 1.

This sequence of commands will create a Tetris-like stack that resembles the uppercase letter "Z" in the given environment.
