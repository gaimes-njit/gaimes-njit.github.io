To generate the letter "Z", we can start by placing a horizontal block (b31) at position 1. Then, we can place two vertical blocks (b13) at positions 2 and 4. Finally, we can place another horizontal block (b31) at position 5. This will form the shape of the letter "Z". 

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "Z":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```
