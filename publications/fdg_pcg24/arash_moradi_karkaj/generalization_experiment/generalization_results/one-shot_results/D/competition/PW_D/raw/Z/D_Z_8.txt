To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "Z" by stacking and positioning the blocks in the defined environment.
