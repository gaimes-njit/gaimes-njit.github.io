To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "D" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base of the structure:
```python
for i in range(3, 16):
    ab_drop('b11', 8)
    ab_drop('b11', 9)
    ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
The blocks are placed in slots 8, 9, and 10 on layers 3 to 15.

3. Place the vertical bar of the "D":
```python
for i in range(3, 6):
    ab_drop('b13', 6)
```
The vertical bar is placed in slot 6 on layers 3 to 5.

4. Place the horizontal part of the "D":
```python
for i in range(6, 12):
    ab_drop('b31', i)
```
The horizontal part is placed in slots 6 to 11 on layer 6.

5. Place the top part of the "D":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
``` 
The top part is placed in slots 6 and 9 on layer 7.

The final structure that resembles the character "D" is generated.
