To generate a stable structure resembling the character "J" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. First, initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code snippet:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Next, we need to drop the blocks in a specific order to ensure stability. Based on the stability rules, we can start by dropping a b11 block at the bottom left slot (slot 0) to serve as the base:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

3. To form the two diagonal lines of the character "J," we can start by dropping a b31 block just above the base on the left side (slot 1). This will serve as the left diagonal line:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Similarly, we can drop another b31 block just above the base on the right side (slot 18) to form the right diagonal line:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 18)
```

5. Finally, to complete the character "J," we need to drop a b13 block above the two diagonal lines but offset to the right. We can achieve this by dropping it at slot 19 to the right of the right diagonal line:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```

Now, the structure should resemble the character "J" and meet all the hard constraints. The final structure grid can be visualized as follows:

```python
[[' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ',
