To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the given code snippet.

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at a suitable slot close to the left boundary to create the vertical part of the "L" shape. To determine the suitable dropping position, we can iterate over the slots from left to right and choose the first slot that satisfies the stability rules. The b13 block should be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks), so we need to ensure that there is a stable base below the dropping position. We can check this by verifying that the slot below the dropping position is either occupied by a b11 or b13 block.

3. After dropping the b13 block, drop a b31 block horizontally to the right of the vertical part to create the horizontal part of the "L" shape. Again, we need to find a suitable dropping position that satisfies the stability rules. The b31 block must be placed on a solid base, so we need to ensure that the three slots below the dropping position are occupied by b11 or b13 blocks. We can iterate over the slots to the right of the vertical part and choose the first slot that satisfies this condition.

4. Finally, drop a b11 block vertically on top of the horizontal part to complete the "L" shape. We need to find a suitable dropping position that satisfies the stability rules. The b11 block should be placed on a solid base, so we need to ensure that the slot below the dropping position is occupied by a b11 or b13 block. We can choose the slot directly above the dropping position of the b31 block as the dropping position for the b11 block.

5. After executing these steps, the provided ab_drop() function can be used to drop each block at its specified dropping position to generate the stable structure that resembles the character "L". The dropping order should be from bottom to top, starting with the b13 block, followed by the b31 block, and finally the b11 block.

Note: The exact dropping positions and order may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem. The steps provided above serve as a general guideline to approach the problem.
