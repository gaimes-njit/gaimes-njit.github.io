To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Set up the structure grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by placing the bottom part of the "M" shape, which consists of two b13 blocks stacked vertically. We can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop these blocks one by one at the desired slots. For example:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Drop the first b13 block at slot 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Drop the second b13 block at slot 5
```

3. Place the middle part of the "M" shape, which is a b31 block. This block needs to be placed on a solid base, so we can drop it on top of the two b13 blocks that were previously placed. For example:
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Drop the b31 block on top of the first b13 block
```

4. Finally, place the top part of the "M" shape, which consists of two b11 blocks. These blocks should be placed above the b31 block to complete the "M" shape. For example:
```
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Drop the first b11 block above the b31 block
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Drop the second b11 block above the b31 block
```

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M" while satisfying all the given constraints. Note that the slot positions used in the examples above are just suggestions; you can adjust them to achieve a different structure if desired.

After generating the structure, you can print it out or visualize it in any desired format.
