To generate a stable structure resembling the character "M," we can approach the problem step by step using the ab_drop() function.

1. First, let's consider the stability constraint (5.1). A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Therefore, we will start by placing two b11 blocks at the bottom layer (layer 0) in slots 8 and 11, as these will act as the base for the structure.

structure[0][8] = 'b11'
structure[0][11] = 'b11'

2. Now, we need to place a b31 block on top of the base. To meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints, we will place the block at layer 1, aligning its center with slot 9.

ab_drop('b31', 9)

This will drop a b31 block at layer 1, slot 9. The resulting structure will be:

structure[0][8] = 'b11'
structure[0][11] = 'b11'
structure[1][9] = 'b31'

3. Next, we will place two b13 blocks on top of the base to form the outer segments of the "M" structure. These blocks will be placed at layer 2, aligning their centers with slots 7 and 12.

ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 12)

This will drop the b13 blocks at layer 2, slots 7 and 12. The resulting structure will be:

structure[0][8] = 'b11'
structure[0][11] = 'b11'
structure[1][9] = 'b31'
structure[2][7] = 'b13'
structure[2][12] = 'b13'

4. Finally, we will place two b11 blocks on top of the structure to form the middle segment of the "M." These blocks will be placed at layer 3, aligning their centers with slots 8 and 11.

ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 11)

This will drop the b11 blocks at layer 3, slots 8 and 11. The resulting structure will be:

structure[0][8] = 'b11'
structure[0][11] = 'b11'
structure[1][9] = 'b31'
structure[2][7] = 'b13'
structure[2][12] = 'b13'
structure[3][8] = 'b11'
structure[3][11] = 'b11'

5. The structure will resemble the character "M." You can print the structure to visualize the result:

for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))

This will output:

    b11 b13      b13 b11
           b31
     b11            b11
