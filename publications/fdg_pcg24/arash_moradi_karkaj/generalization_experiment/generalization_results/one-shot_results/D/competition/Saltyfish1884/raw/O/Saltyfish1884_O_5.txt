To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "O" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet.

2. Place a b31 block on the base layer (layer 0) by calling the ab_drop() function with x = "b31" and y = (W/2) - 1. This ensures that the block's center is aligned with the middle of the map.

3. Place two b13 blocks on top of the b31 block to form a stable base for the structure. Call the ab_drop() function with x = "b13" and y = (W/2) - 2 and (W/2).

4. Place two b13 blocks on the next layer (layer 2) above the previous blocks. Call the ab_drop() function with x = "b13" and y = (W/2) - 2 and (W/2).

5. Place two b13 blocks on the next layer (layer 4) above the previous blocks. Call the ab_drop() function with x = "b13" and y = (W/2) - 2 and (W/2).

6. Place a b31 block on the top layer (layer 6) above the previous blocks. Call the ab_drop() function with x = "b31" and y = (W/2) - 1.

7. Place two b13 blocks on the next layer (layer 8) above the previous blocks. Call the ab_drop() function with x = "b13" and y = (W/2) - 2 and (W/2).

8. Place two b13 blocks on the next layer (layer 10) above the previous blocks. Call the ab_drop() function with x = "b13" and y = (W/2) - 2 and (W/2).

9. Place two b13 blocks on the next layer (layer 12) above the previous blocks. Call the ab_drop() function with x = "b13" and y = (W/2) - 2 and (W/2).

10. Place a b31 block on the top layer (layer 14) above the previous blocks. Call the ab_drop() function with x = "b31" and y = (W/2) - 1.

11. The resulting structure should resemble the character "O" and meet all the hard constraints of stability. The soft constraint of no boundary intrusion is automatically ensured by the ab_drop() function and the provided constraints.

The code to generate this structure would look like:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Place the first b31 block on the base layer
ab_drop("b31", int((W/2) - 1))

# Place two b13 blocks on top of the b31 block
ab_drop("b13", int((W/2) - 2))
ab_drop("b13", int((W/2)))

# Place two b13 blocks on the next layer
ab_drop("b13", int((W/2) - 2))
ab_drop("b13", int((W/2)))

# Repeat the above steps to build the structure
# Place a b31 block
ab_drop("b31", int((W/2) - 1))

# Place two b13 blocks
ab_drop("b13", int((W/2) - 2))
ab_drop("b13", int((W/2)))

# Place two b13 blocks
ab_drop("b13", int((W/2) - 2))
ab_drop("b13", int((W/2)))

# Place two b13 blocks
ab_drop("b13", int((W/2) - 2))
ab_drop("b13", int((W/2)))

# Place a b31 block on the top layer
ab_drop("b31", int((W/2) - 1))
```

Please note that the exact values of the slot numbers (y) may need adjustments based on the specific dimensions of the grid and blocks used in your environment.
