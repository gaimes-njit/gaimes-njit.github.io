To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Start by placing the b11 block at the bottom left corner of the structure to act as the base. We can use the ab_drop() function to achieve this:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

Step 3: Place the b13 block vertically above the base to form the left vertical stroke of the "R". We can use the ab_drop() function to drop the block starting from the bottom left corner of the structure and aligned with the base:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

Step 4: Place three consecutive b31 blocks horizontally to form the top horizontal stroke of the "R". We need to ensure that these blocks are placed on top of the vertical stroke and aligned properly. We can use the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

Step 5: Place the b13 block vertically above the rightmost b31 block to form the right vertical stroke of the "R". Again, we can use the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

Step 6: The resulting structure should resemble the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints and stability rules.

Keep in mind that the specific slot numbers used in the ab_drop() function calls may vary depending on the desired positioning and alignment. Also, make sure to update the structure list accordingly to visualize the resulting structure.

You can further experiment with different slot numbers and block placements to generate alternative structures that still resemble the character "R".
