To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b13 block, representing the vertical line of the "T", on the left side of the structure:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Drop two b11 blocks, representing the horizontal line of the "T", on top of the vertical line:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

4. Drop the b31 block, representing the horizontal crossbar of the "T", on top of the horizontal line:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. The resulting structure will resemble the character "T" while meeting the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is the code to generate the structure:
```
W = 20  # Width of the map
H = 16  # Height of the map

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "T", with the vertical line on the left, the horizontal line on top, and the horizontal crossbar connecting them.
