To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "U" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base of the structure by dropping a b11 block at the center slot (W/2) using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
```

3. Place the two vertical sides of the "U" by dropping b13 blocks adjacent to the base blocks. We can drop them at slots W/2-2 and W/2+2:
```
ab_drop('b13', W//2-2)
ab_drop('b13', W//2+2)
```

4. Place the horizontal bridge of the "U" by dropping a b31 block on top of the two vertical blocks. We can drop it at the slot W/2:
```
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

5. Make sure the structure is stable and does not collapse. To do this, we need to consider the stability rules:
   - Ensure the b31 block is placed on a solid base by checking that the blocks below it (b11 or b13 blocks) are not empty. If they are, adjust the position of the b31 block until it is above a solid base.
   - Ensure the blocks are placed as low as possible by dropping them at the lowest possible layer.

6. Check if the structure meets the no boundary intrusion soft constraint. If any blocks are intruding on the map's boundary (slots 0 or 19), adjust their positions to avoid intrusion.

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the structure is stable and satisfies all constraints.

Here is an example of how the final structure might look after applying these steps:

```
