To generate a structure that resembles the character "W" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the shape of the structure: The character "W" can be represented by three b31 blocks positioned vertically. Each block consists of three units horizontally. The overall structure can be visualized as follows:
```
   b31      b31      b31
            b13
```
2. Determine the dropping position and order: To ensure stability and meet the constraints, we need to drop the blocks in a strategic manner. We can start by dropping the b31 blocks at the lower part of the structure, followed by the b13 block. The dropping position and order can be determined using techniques from the block-stacking problem.

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks: Implement the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks one by one. The `ab_drop()` function takes the block type and slot number as arguments.

4. Implement the `ab_drop()` function: Implement the `ab_drop()` function using the provided code snippet. This function will drop the blocks from the top, move them down until they land on the base or another block, and place them on the structure.

5. Put suitable blocks to form the structure: Using the determined dropping positions and order, call the `ab_drop()` function to put the suitable blocks and form the structure that resembles the character "W". Make sure to place the blocks as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing and ensure stability.

6. Visualize and validate the generated structure: After generating the structure, visualize it using the `structure` variable. Validate the structure to ensure it meets all the hard constraints, such as stability and no boundary intrusion.

Here's an example of how the code might look:

```python
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers

# Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # Initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # Drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # Place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Drop the b31 blocks to form the lower part of the structure
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 13)

# Drop the b13 block to form the upper part of the structure
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Visualize the structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "W" and meet all the hard constraints. You can modify the dropping positions and order according to your specific requirements.
