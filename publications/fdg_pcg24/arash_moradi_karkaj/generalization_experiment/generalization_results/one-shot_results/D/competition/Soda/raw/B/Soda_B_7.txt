To generate a structure that looks like a capital "B" in the given level, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the base blocks of the letter "B":
   - Place a column block "b13" at x_position=5 to form the left side of the letter "B".
   - Place a column block "b13" at x_position=13 to form the right side of the letter "B".
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 5)
   ab_drop("b13", 13)
   ```

2. Place the top bar of the letter "B":
   - Place a row block "b31" at x_position=4 to form the top bar of the letter "B".
   ```
   ab_drop("b31", 4)
   ```

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```
