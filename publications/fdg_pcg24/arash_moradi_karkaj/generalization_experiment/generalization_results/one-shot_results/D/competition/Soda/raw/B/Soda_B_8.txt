To generate a structure that looks like the letter "B" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully drop and position blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the first block (b13) at the bottom-left corner of the grid:
ab_drop("b13", 0)

2. Place the second block (b31) above the first block, centered:
ab_drop("b31", 1)

3. Place the third block (b31) above the second block, centered:
ab_drop("b31", 1)

4. Place the fourth block (b11) above the third block, centered:
ab_drop("b11", 1)

5. Place the fifth block (b31) above the fourth block, centered:
ab_drop("b31", 1)

6. Place the sixth block (b31) above the fifth block, centered:
ab_drop("b31", 1)

By following these steps, we can create a structure that resembles the letter "B" and maintains stability.
