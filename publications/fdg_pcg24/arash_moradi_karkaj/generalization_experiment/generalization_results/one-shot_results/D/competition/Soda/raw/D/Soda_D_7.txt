First, let's start by creating the base of the letter "D". We can use the `b13` block to create a column in the bottom left corner. We will drop it at `x_position=0` to center it in the leftmost column.

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

Next, we need to create the vertical stroke of the letter "D". We can use another `b13` block and drop it at `x_position=2` to center it in the third column.

```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

Now, let's create the rounded part of the letter "D". We will use a `b31` block and drop it at `x_position=5` to center it in the sixth column.

```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

That completes the structure of the letter "D". Here's the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```
