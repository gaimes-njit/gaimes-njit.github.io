To create the letter "D" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: a square block for the straight vertical part, a row block for the top part, and a row block for the bottom part.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Step 1: Place the square block
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# Step 2: Place the top row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Step 3: Place the bottom row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation will create the letter "D" in the level.
