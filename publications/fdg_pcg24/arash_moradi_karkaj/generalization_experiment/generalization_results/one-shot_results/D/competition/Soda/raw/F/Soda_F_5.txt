In order to generate the structure in the level that looks like the capital character "F", we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Create the vertical pipe of the F
```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

Step 2: Create the horizontal bar of the F
```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

Step 3: Adjust the positions of the blocks to form the final shape of the F
```
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

The complete implementation:
```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```
