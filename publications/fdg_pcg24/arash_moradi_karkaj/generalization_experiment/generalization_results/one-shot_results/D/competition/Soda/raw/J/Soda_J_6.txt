To create a structure that looks like the capital character "J" in the level, we can follow these steps:

1. Drop the bottom tick of the "J" shape by using the "b31" block with the center pivot at x_position=9. This will occupy cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Drop the middle pipe of the "J" shape by using the "b13" block with the center pivot at x_position=9. This will occupy cells (9, 1), (9, 2), and (9, 3).

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

3. Drop the top bar of the "J" shape by using the "b11" block with the center pivot at x_position=9. This will occupy the cell (9, 4).

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
