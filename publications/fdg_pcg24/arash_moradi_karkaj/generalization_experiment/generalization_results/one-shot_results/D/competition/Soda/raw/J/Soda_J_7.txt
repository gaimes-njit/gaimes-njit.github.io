In order to generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "J" (TARGET), we can break it down into three blocks: a top bar, a middle pipe, and the bottom tick. We will drop each block in the bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. Here is the implementation:

```python
# Drop the top bar block (b31) at position 8
ab_drop("b31", 8)

# Drop the middle pipe block (b13) at position 9
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Drop the bottom tick block (b11) at position 10
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Please note that this is just one possible implementation. The position values (8, 9, and 10) can be adjusted to achieve different orientations or spacing between the blocks if desired. The final structure should resemble the letter "J" and be stable under gravity.
