To create the capital letter "N" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into three blocks: two column blocks and one row block. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the first column block at x_position = 4:
```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```

2. Place the row block below the first column block at x_position = 4:
```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

3. Place the second column block to the right of the row block at x_position = 8:
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

By following these three steps, we can create a structure in the level that looks like a capital "N".
