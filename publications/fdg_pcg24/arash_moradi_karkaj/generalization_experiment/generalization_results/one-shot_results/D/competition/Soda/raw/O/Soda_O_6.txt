To generate a level that looks like the capital character "O" (TARGET), we can start by dropping a square block in the center of the grid. This will serve as the base of the structure.

Next, we can drop a row block on top of the square block to create the top part of the "O".

Finally, we can drop two column blocks on each side of the square block to complete the structure.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Drop the square block at the center of the grid
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# Drop the row block on top of the square block
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Drop the column blocks on each side of the square block
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

This implementation will create a structure in the shape of the letter "O" (TARGET) while ensuring stability and similarity.
