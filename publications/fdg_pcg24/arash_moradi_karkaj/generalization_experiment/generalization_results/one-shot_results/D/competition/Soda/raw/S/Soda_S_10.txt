The first step is to create the base of the "S" in a bottom-to-top fashion. 

To achieve this, we can start by dropping a row block ("b31") at the center of the grid at vertical index 0:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the middle section of the "S". We can do this by dropping a column block ("b13") at the center of the grid at vertical index 2:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, we can create the top section of the "S" by dropping another row block ("b31") at the center of the grid at vertical index 4:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Combining all the steps, the complete implementation code is:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
