To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "X" (TARGET), we can use the following steps:

Step 1: Build the base of the "X"
- Drop a row block (b31) at x_position=8.
- Drop a row block (b31) at x_position=11.

Step 2: Build the middle section of the "X"
- Drop a column block (b13) at x_position=10.

Step 3: Build the top section of the "X"
- Drop a column block (b13) at x_position=8.
- Drop a column block (b13) at x_position=11.

Complete Implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

Ensure to drop the blocks in the specified order to enforce stability and achieve the best similarity with the target shape.
