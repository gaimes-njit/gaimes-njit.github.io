To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "A" and meets all the constraints, we will use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner.

The first step is to drop the three b11 blocks to form the center of the "A" shape. We will drop these blocks in the 10th, 11th, and 12th slots, centered horizontally. This ensures that the blocks are stable and do not intrude on the boundary.

Next, we will drop the b31 blocks to form the slanted sides of the "A" shape. We will drop these blocks in the 8th-10th and 12th-14th slots, starting from the 11th layer and going up. This creates the slanted sides of the "A" shape while maintaining stability and avoiding boundary intrusion.

Finally, we will drop the b13 blocks to form the top part of the "A" shape. We will drop these blocks in the 10th and 11th slots, starting from the 10th layer. This completes the structure of the "A" shape while satisfying all the constraints.

Here is the code to generate the stable structure:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # ... implementation of the ab_drop() function as described above ...

# Drop b11 blocks to form the center of the "A" shape
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 12)

# Drop b31 blocks to form the slanted sides of the "A" shape
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
ab_drop('b31', 14)

# Drop b13 blocks to form the top part of the "A" shape
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

After executing this code, the `structure` grid will represent a stable structure that looks like the character "A" and meets all the given constraints.
