To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "D" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.

```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping positions and order for each block to form the character "D" shape.

3. Start by dropping the b11 block at a suitable position on the bottom layer (layer 0) to serve as the base of the structure. This block will be centered at slot 7 (x_position = 7).

```
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```

4. Drop the b31 block above the base block, aligned with its center at slot 6 (x_position = 6). This block will extend upwards by one unit.

```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

5. Drop the b13 block above the b31 block, aligned with its center at slot 4 (x_position = 4). This block will extend upwards by three units.

```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

6. Drop the b11 block above the b13 block, aligned with its center at slot 4 (x_position = 4). This block will extend upwards by one unit.

```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

7. Drop the b31 block above the b11 block, aligned with its center at slot 3 (x_position = 3). This block will extend upwards by one unit.

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

8. Drop the b11 block above the b31 block, aligned with its center at slot 3 (x_position = 3). This block will extend upwards by one unit.

```
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

9. Drop the b31 block above the b11 block, aligned with its center at slot 2 (x_position = 2). This block will extend upwards by one unit.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

10. Drop the b11 block above the b31 block, aligned with its center at slot 2 (x_position = 2). This block will extend upwards by one unit.

```
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

11. The resulting structure will resemble the character "D" and meet all the constraints.
