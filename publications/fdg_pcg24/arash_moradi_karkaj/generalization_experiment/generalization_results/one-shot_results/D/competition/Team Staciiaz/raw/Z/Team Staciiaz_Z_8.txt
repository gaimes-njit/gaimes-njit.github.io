To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Z" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to determine the dropping position and order of the blocks based on the block-stacking problem techniques. Here's one possible solution:

```python
# Map Initialization
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

# Function to check stability of the structure
def is_stable():
    for x in range(W):
        for y in range(H-1, 0, -1):
            if structure[y][x] == 'x' and structure[y-1][x] != 'x':
                return False
    return True

# Function to check boundary intrusion
def has_boundary_intrusion():
    for x in range(W):
        if structure[H-1][x] == 'x' or structure[0][x] == 'x':
            return True
    return False

# Drop the blocks to form the "Z" structure
ab_drop('b31', 0)  # Drop the horizontal block at slot 0
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Drop the vertical block at slot 2
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Drop the horizontal block at slot 4

# Check constraints
if is_stable() and not has_boundary_intrusion():
    print("Structure generated successfully!")
else:
    print("Failed to meet constraints. Adjust block positions.")
```

This solution drops a horizontal block at slot 0, a vertical block at slot 2, and another horizontal block at slot 4 to form the "Z" structure. The stability of the structure is checked by ensuring that each block is supported by either the base or previously dropped blocks. Boundary intrusion is checked to ensure that no blocks extend beyond the boundaries of the map.

You can adjust the block positions or try different dropping orders to meet the constraints and generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Z".
