Since the goal is to construct a level for Science Birds that resembles the English letter "A", we can proceed step by step to achieve this. 

First, let's create the base of the letter "A" by dropping a b31 block at slot 1:

ab_drop('b31', 1)

Next, we need to create the legs of the letter "A" by dropping two b13 blocks at slots 0 and 2:

ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)

Finally, we can drop a b31 block at slot 1 to complete the top part of the letter "A":

ab_drop('b31', 1)

The final code sequence to construct the level for Science Birds that resembles the letter "A" is as follows:

ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
