Example:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Explanation:

In this example, the blocks are dropped in a strategic manner to form the capital letter "Z". The blocks are placed in the following sequence:

1. `b31` block dropped at `x_position` 5.
2. `b13` block dropped at `x_position` 11.
3. `b31` block dropped at `x_position` 7.
4. `b13` block dropped at `x_position` 9.

This sequence of block placements results in a stable structure resembling the letter "Z". The blocks are positioned to create the diagonal lines of the letter, while maintaining stability and minimizing boundary intrusion.
