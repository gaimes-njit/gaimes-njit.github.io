1. The letter "G" with asterisks can be drawn as follows:
```
*****
*     
*     
*  ***
*    *
*    *
 ***** 
```

2. Line-by-line, the asterisks and spaces generated in each row are:

Row 1: 5 asterisks, 0 spaces
Row 2: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces
Row 3: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces
Row 4: 1 asterisk, 2 spaces, 3 asterisks
Row 5: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 6: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 7: 5 asterisks, 0 spaces

3. Using "x" for asterisks and "y" for spaces, the representation becomes:

Row 1: 5x
Row 2: 1x, 4y
Row 3: 1x, 4y
Row 4: 1x, 2y, 3x
Row 5: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 6: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 7: 5x

4. Writing out each "x" and "y" for each row side-by-side:

Row 1: 5x
Row 2: 1x, 4y
Row 3: 1x, 4y
Row 4: 1x, 2y, 3x
Row 5: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 6: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 7: 5x

5. Position of each variable for each row:

Row 1: x-1, x-2, x-3, x-4, x-5
Row 2: x-1, y-2, y-3, y-4, y-5
Row 3: x-1, y-2, y-3, y-4, y-5
Row 4: x-1, y-2, x-3, y-4, x-5, x-6
Row 5: x-1, y-2, y-3, y-4, y-5, x-6
Row 6: x-1, y-2, y-3, y-4, y-5, x-6
Row 7: x-1, x-2, x-3, x-4, x-5

6. The corresponding `ab_drop` function calls for each row are:

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```
Note: The "b11" is just an example of the function name and can be replaced with the actual function name used in your code.
