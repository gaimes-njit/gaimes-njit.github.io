The steps to complete the task are as follows:

1. Draw the letter "J" with asterisks:
```
  ***
   *
   *
   *
 * *
*** 
```

2. List the asterisks and spaces generated in each row:
Row 1: 3x, 0y
Row 2: 1x, 2y, 1x
Row 3: 1x, 2y, 1x
Row 4: 1x, 2y, 1x
Row 5: 1x, 1y, 1x
Row 6: 3x

3. Replace asterisks with "x" and spaces with "y" in each row:
Row 1: xxx
Row 2: xyxxy
Row 3: xyxxy
Row 4: xyxxy
Row 5: xyxyx
Row 6: xxx

4. Write out each x and y for each row:
Row 1: 3x
Row 2: 1x, 1y, 1x, 1y
Row 3: 1x, 1y, 1x, 1y
Row 4: 1x, 1y, 1x, 1y
Row 5: 1x, 1y, 1x, 1y, 1x
Row 6: 3x

5. Indicate the position of each variable for each row:
Row 1: x-1, x-2, x-3
Row 2: x-1, y-2, x-3, y-4
Row 3: x-1, y-2, x-3, y-4
Row 4: x-1, y-2, x-3, y-4
Row 5: x-1, y-2, x-3, y-4, x-5
Row 6: x-1, x-2, x-3

6. Return a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
