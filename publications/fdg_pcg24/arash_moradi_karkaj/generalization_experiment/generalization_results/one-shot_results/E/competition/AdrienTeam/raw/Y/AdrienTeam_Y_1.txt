To create a stable structure resembling "Y" while adhering to the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block, which will be a vertical block ('b13'). Then drop two horizontal blocks ('b11') on each side of the vertical block to form the arms of the "Y":
```
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Drop the vertical block at slot 10
ab_drop('b11', 9)   # Drop the first horizontal block for the left arm at slot 9
ab_drop('b11', 11)  # Drop the second horizontal block for the right arm at slot 11
```

3. Create the diagonal part of the "Y" by dropping two horizontal blocks ('b11') above the vertical block, offset by one slot on each side:
```
ab_drop('b11', 8)   # Drop the first horizontal block for the diagonal at slot 8
ab_drop('b11', 12)  # Drop the second horizontal block for the diagonal at slot 12
```

4. Extend the arms of the "Y" downwards by dropping a vertical block ('b13') below each horizontal block in the arms:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)   # Drop the vertical block below the left arm at slot 9
ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Drop the vertical block below the right arm at slot 11
```

5. Finally, drop a horizontal block ('b11') below the diagonal part to complete the base of the "Y":
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Drop the horizontal block for the base below the diagonal at slot 10
```

The complete solution is as follows:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 12)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
