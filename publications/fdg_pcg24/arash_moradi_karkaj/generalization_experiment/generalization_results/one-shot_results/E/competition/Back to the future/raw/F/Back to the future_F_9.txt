To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "F" and meets all the hard constraints, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at the center slot to form the vertical line of the "F" shape. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the block at the appropriate position:
ab_drop('b13', W//2)

3. Next, drop a b31 block starting from slot W//2 - 1 to W//2 + 1 to form the horizontal line of the "F" shape:
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 1)
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
ab_drop('b31', W//2 + 1)

4. Now, we need to add stability to the structure. To do this, we will drop additional blocks to provide support to the b31 block at the top. Drop a b11 block at the slot W//2-1 of the layer just below the b31 block:
ab_drop('b11', W//2 - 1)

5. Lastly, drop another b11 block at the slot W//2+1 of the layer just below the b31 block to complete the support:
ab_drop('b11', W//2 + 1)

The resulting structure will resemble the uppercase letter "F" and meet all the hard constraints. You can continue to add additional blocks or modify the dropping positions to make the structure more stable or meet any specific requirements.
