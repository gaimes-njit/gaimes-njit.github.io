# Solution:

First, let's initialize the structure as an empty grid:

```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Now, we can start dropping blocks using the `ab_drop()` function to form the letter "R".

To start, we can drop a 'b31' block at the center (slot 10) of the bottom layer (layer 0) to create the base of the letter:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

Next, we can drop a 'b13' block one slot to the left (slot 9) and one layer up (layer 1) to form the vertical line of the letter:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Finally, we can drop another 'b31' block on top of the vertical line, slightly to the right (slot 11) and one layer up (layer 2):

```python
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

This will complete the letter "R" structure.

Putting it all together, the code to generate the letter "R" using the `ab_drop()` function would be:

```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

Note: The code provided above is just an example of how to generate the letter "R" using the `ab_drop()` function. Depending on the specific requirements or desired shape of the letter, the code may need to be adjusted accordingly.
