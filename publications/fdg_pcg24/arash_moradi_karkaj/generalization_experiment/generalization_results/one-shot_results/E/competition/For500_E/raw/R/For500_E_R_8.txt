To generate a stable structure resembling the capital English letter "R", we can use the ab_drop() function in a specific sequence. 

First, we drop a 'b31' block at slot 9 to create the vertical line of the letter "R". 

ab_drop('b31', 9)

Next, we drop a 'b13' block at slot 7 to create the diagonal line of the letter "R". 

ab_drop('b13', 7)

Finally, we drop another 'b31' block at slot 12 to complete the horizontal line of the letter "R". 

ab_drop('b31', 12)

The resulting code using the ab_drop() function is as follows:

ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
