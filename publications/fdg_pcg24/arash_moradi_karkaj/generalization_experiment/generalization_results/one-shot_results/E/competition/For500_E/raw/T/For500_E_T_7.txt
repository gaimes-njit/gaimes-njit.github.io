# Solution

# Initialize the structure grid
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Generate the letter "T" using ab_drop()

# Drop the horizontal block at 7 to create the base of the "T"
# The bottom layer is 15, so we need to use layer 14 as the drop layer
ab_drop('b31', 7)

# Drop the vertical block at 7 to create the center of the "T"
# The bottom layer is 14, so we need to use layer 13 as the drop layer
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Drop the horizontal block at 5 to create the top of the "T"
# The bottom layer is 13, so we need to use layer 12 as the drop layer
ab_drop('b31', 5)

# Drop the horizontal block at 8 to create the top-right part of the "T"
# The bottom layer is 12, so we need to use layer 11 as the drop layer
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Drop the horizontal block at 6 to create the top-left part of the "T"
# The bottom layer is 11, so we need to use layer 10 as the drop layer
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Drop the vertical block at 7 to create the center of the top-left part of the "T"
# The bottom layer is 10, so we need to use layer 9 as the drop layer
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Drop the vertical block at 7 to create the center of the top-right part of the "T"
# The bottom layer is 9, so we need to use layer 8 as the drop layer
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Drop the horizontal block at 7 to create the top-center part of the "T"
# The bottom layer is 8, so we need to use layer 7 as the drop layer
ab_drop('b31', 7)
