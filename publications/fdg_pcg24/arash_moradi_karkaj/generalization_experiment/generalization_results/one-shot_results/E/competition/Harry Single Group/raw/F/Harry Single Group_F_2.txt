Let's start by initializing the field:

```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, we can start placing the bricks to form the letter "F". We will follow these steps:

1. Place the b31 brick vertically on the ground at x_position = 4. This will form the base of the "F".
2. Place the b13 brick horizontally above the base, starting from x_position = 4. This will form the upper bar of the "F".
3. Place the b11 brick vertically above the point of contact between the base and upper bar. This will form the vertical stroke of the "F".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

After executing these steps, the structure resembling the letter "F" will be formed on the field.

Here is the complete code:

```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
