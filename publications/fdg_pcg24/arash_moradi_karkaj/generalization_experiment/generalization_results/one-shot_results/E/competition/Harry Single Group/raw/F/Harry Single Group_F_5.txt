Before generating the required structure, let's analyze the structure of the letter "F" and come up with a plan to create it using the given functions and props.

The letter "F" consists of three bricks - two vertical rectangular bricks (b13) and one horizontal rectangular brick (b31). We need to place these bricks in a specific order to form the shape of the letter "F".

Here is the plan to generate the structure:

1. Place the first vertical brick (b13) at the starting x_position. This will be the left part of the letter "F". This brick should be placed vertically at the ground level, occupying the cells (x_position, 0), (x_position, 1), and (x_position, 2).

2. Place the second vertical brick (b13) at the starting x_position + 1. This will be the right part of the letter "F". This brick should be placed vertically at the ground level, occupying the cells (x_position + 1, 0), (x_position + 1, 1), and (x_position + 1, 2).

3. Place the horizontal brick (b31) at the starting x_position. This will be the crossbar of the letter "F". This brick should be placed horizontally at a y-axis position of 3, occupying the cells (x_position, 3), (x_position + 1, 3), and (x_position + 2, 3).

4. Ensure stability by making sure the upper bricks have the same number of occupied cells on both sides of the pivot point. In this case, the pivot point is the point of contact between the two vertical bricks. The pivot point is at (x_position, 2) and (x_position + 1, 2). The upper brick (second vertical brick) should have one occupied cell on the left side of the pivot and one occupied cell on the right side of the pivot to maintain stability.

5. Avoid boundary collisions by ensuring that all occupied cells of each brick do not exceed the boundaries of the field.

Based on this plan, let's generate the required structure using the ab_drop(x, y) function:

```python
# Map initialization
map = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Generate the structure
ab_drop('b13', x_position)
ab_drop('b13', x_position + 1)
ab_drop('b31', x_position)

# Print the resulting map
for row in map:
    print(row)
```

Note: You need to replace 'x_position' with the desired x-axis position where you want to place the bricks.
