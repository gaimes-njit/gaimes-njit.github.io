To form the shape resembling the letter "J" using the available props and the ab_drop(x, y) function, the following steps can be followed:

1. Initialize the field array with zeros to represent empty cells. Each element of the array represents a cell in the field.

2. Begin by placing the b31 brick on the ground. To do this, execute ab_drop('b31', x) with x being the x_position on the ground. The occupied cells of the b31 brick will be (x-1, 0), (x, 0), and (x+1, 0). 

3. Next, place the b13 brick vertically on top of the b31 brick. To do this, execute ab_drop('b13', x) with x being the x_position aligned with the b31 brick. The occupied cells of the b13 brick will be (x, 1), (x, 2), and (x, 3).

4. Finally, place the b11 brick on top of the b13 brick. To do this, execute ab_drop('b11', x) with x being the x_position aligned with the b13 brick. The occupied cell of the b11 brick will be (x, 4).

The resulting structure will resemble the letter "J" and satisfy the stability and boundary collision requirements.

Here is the code to generate the structure:

```python
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Place b31 brick on the ground
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Adjust x position as desired

# Place b13 brick vertically on top of b31 brick
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Adjust x position as desired

# Place b11 brick on top of b13 brick
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Adjust x position as desired
```

Note: The x positions used above are just examples. You can adjust them according to your desired placement of the bricks.
