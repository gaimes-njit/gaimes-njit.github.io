To generate the letter "N" shape using the available props and the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the map with an empty field of 20 columns and 16 rows.
2. Use the ab_drop() function to place the bricks on the field, one by one, starting from the bottom-left corner and moving towards the right.
3. Place the b13 brick at position (0,0) to form the vertical part of the "N". This ensures stability since there are no other bricks to cause an imbalance.
4. Place the b31 brick at position (2,0) to form the horizontal part of the "N". The x_position is set to 2 to align the brick with the vertical part.
5. Place the b11 brick at position (5,1) to form the diagonal part of the "N". The brick is rotated 45 degrees to fit the shape.
6. Check for stability by comparing the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot. In this case, the structure remains stable.
7. Avoid boundary collisions by ensuring that the occupied cells of the bricks do not exceed the boundaries of the field.

The code to generate the "N" shape would look like this:

```python
# Initialize the map
map = [[' ' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Place the bricks
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Vertical part
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Horizontal part
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Diagonal part

# Display the map
for row in map:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The resulting map would be:

```
