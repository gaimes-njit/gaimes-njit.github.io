To generate a shape resembling the letter "P" using the given props and function, we can divide the process into three parts: creating the vertical stroke, creating the horizontal stroke, and creating the curved part of the letter "P".

First, let's create the vertical stroke:

```python
# Creating the vertical stroke
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This will create a vertical stroke starting from the x-position 3 on the ground. The cells (3, 0), (3, 1), and (3, 2) will be occupied.

Next, let's create the horizontal stroke:

```python
# Creating the horizontal stroke
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will create a horizontal stroke starting from the x-position 2, just above the vertical stroke. The cells (2, 3), (3, 3), and (4, 3) will be occupied.

Finally, let's create the curved part of the letter "P":

```python
# Creating the curved part
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

This will create two bricks to form the curved part of the letter "P". The first brick, b31, starts from x-position 1 and occupies the cells (1, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 4). The second brick, b11, starts from x-position 0 and occupies the cell (0, 5).

As a result, the function calls will generate a shape resembling the letter "P".
