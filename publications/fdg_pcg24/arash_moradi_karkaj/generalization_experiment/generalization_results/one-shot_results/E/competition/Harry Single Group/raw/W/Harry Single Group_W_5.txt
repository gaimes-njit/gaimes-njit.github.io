To form a shape resembling the letter "W", we can use the following steps:

1. Initialize the field by creating a 2D array with dimensions 20x16 and set all cells to empty.

2. Place the first b13 brick on the ground at position x=2 using the ab_drop('b13', 2) function.

3. Place the second b13 brick on the ground at position x=7 using the ab_drop('b13', 7) function.

4. To form the middle part of the letter "W", we need to stack a b13 brick on top of a b31 brick. Since the width of a b13 brick is smaller than the width of the b31 brick, we need to offset the position of the b13 brick accordingly.

   - Place a b13 brick at position x=5 using the ab_drop('b13', 5) function.
   - Place a b31 brick at position x=3 using the ab_drop('b31', 3) function.

5. For the final step, we just need to place a b13 brick on top of the previous structure. Again, we need to adjust the position to align it correctly.

   - Place a b13 brick at position x=9 using the ab_drop('b13', 9) function.

Below is the code snippet that generates the required structure while satisfying the important notes:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the field
field = [[' ' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Step 2: Place the first b13 brick
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Step 3: Place the second b13 brick
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Step 4: Form the middle part of the letter "W"
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 3)

# Step 5: Place the final b13 brick
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

After executing the above code, the cells in the field occupied by the letter "W" will be marked with 'X'.
