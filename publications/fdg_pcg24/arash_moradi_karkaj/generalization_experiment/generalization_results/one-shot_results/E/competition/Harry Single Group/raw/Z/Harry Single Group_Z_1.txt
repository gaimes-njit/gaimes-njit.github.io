To form the shape resembling the letter "Z", we can start by placing the b13 brick vertically at the desired position, followed by placing the b31 brick horizontally on top of it.

Here's the code to generate the required structure:

```python
# Map initialization
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check if a cell is valid and unoccupied
def is_valid_cell(x, y):
    if x < 0 or x >= 20 or y < 0 or y >= 16:
        return False
    if field[y][x] != 0:
        return False
    return True

# Function to place a brick on the field
def place_brick(x_start, y_start, brick):
    x_end = x_start
    y_end = y_start

    if brick == 'b13':
        x_end = x_start + 1
        y_end = y_start + 2
    elif brick == 'b31':
        x_end = x_start + 2
        y_end = y_start + 1

    if not is_valid_cell(x_start, y_start) or not is_valid_cell(x_end, y_end):
        return

    for y in range(y_start, y_end + 1):
        for x in range(x_start, x_end + 1):
            field[y][x] = 1

# Place the b13 brick vertically
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Place the b31 brick horizontally on top
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

After executing this code, the cells (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), and (7, 3) will be occupied, forming the shape resembling the letter "Z".
