To create the structure of the letter "E" inside a 20*16 box, we can use the ab_drop() function with the specified blocktypes and x positions.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "E" structure:

1. Drop a b31 block at x position 0:
ab_drop('b31', 0)

2. Drop a b31 block at x position 0 again, starting from below the previous block:
ab_drop('b31', 0)

3. Drop a b13 block at x position 0, starting from below the previous blocks:
ab_drop('b13', 0)

4. Drop a b13 block at x position 0 again, starting from below the previous blocks:
ab_drop('b13', 0)

5. Drop a b11 block at x position 0, starting from below the previous blocks:
ab_drop('b11', 0)

6. Drop a b11 block at x position 0 again, starting from below the previous blocks:
ab_drop('b11', 0)

7. Drop a b11 block at x position 0 again, starting from below the previous blocks:
ab_drop('b11', 0)

8. Drop a b11 block at x position 0 again, starting from below the previous blocks:
ab_drop('b11', 0)

9. Drop a b11 block at x position 0 again, starting from below the previous blocks:
ab_drop('b11', 0)

10. Drop a b11 block at x position 0 again, starting from below the previous blocks:
ab_drop('b11', 0)

This sequence of commands will create the structure of the letter "E" inside the 20*16 box.
