To create a structure exactly like the letter "P" inside a 20*16 box, we'll need to use the ab_drop('blocktype', x position) command to drop different blocks at specific positions. The positions will be measured from the top left corner of the box, with the area starting from 0,0.

To create the letter "P", we'll need the following blocks:

1. Two b31 blocks (3*1 blocks) placed vertically for the vertical line of the "P":
   - ab_drop('b31', 2)
   - ab_drop('b31', 3)

2. A b11 block (1*1 block) placed at the bottom-right corner of the vertical line for the "P" base:
   - ab_drop('b11', 4)

3. A b13 block (1*3 block) placed horizontally above the base of the "P":
   - ab_drop('b13', 4)
   - ab_drop('b13', 3)
   - ab_drop('b13', 2)

This sequence of commands will create a structure exactly like the letter "P" inside the 20*16 box.
