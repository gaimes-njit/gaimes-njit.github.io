To create an "S" shape using the ab_drop() function inside a 20x16 box, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a single 1x1 block in the top left corner of the box.
   - ab_drop('b11', 0)

2. Move to the right side and place a 1x3 block vertically downwards.
   - ab_drop('b13', 1)

3. Move down to the bottom right corner of the 1x3 block and place a 1x1 block.
   - ab_drop('b11', 4)

4. Move to the left side and place a 1x3 block vertically upwards.
   - ab_drop('b13', 3)

5. Move up to the top left corner of the 1x3 block and place a 1x1 block.
   - ab_drop('b11', 0)

6. Move to the right side and place a 1x3 block vertically downwards.
   - ab_drop('b13', 5)

7. Move down to the bottom right corner of the 1x3 block and place a 1x1 block.
   - ab_drop('b11', 9)

8. Move to the left side and place a 1x3 block vertically upwards.
   - ab_drop('b13', 7)

9. Move up to the top left corner of the 1x3 block and place a 1x1 block.
   - ab_drop('b11', 4)

10. Move to the right side and place a 1x3 block vertically downwards.
    - ab_drop('b13', 9)

11. Move down to the bottom right corner of the 1x3 block and place a 1x1 block.
    - ab_drop('b11', 13)

12. Move to the left side and place a 1x3 block vertically upwards.
    - ab_drop('b13', 11)

This will create a structure in the shape of the letter "S" inside the 20x16 box.
