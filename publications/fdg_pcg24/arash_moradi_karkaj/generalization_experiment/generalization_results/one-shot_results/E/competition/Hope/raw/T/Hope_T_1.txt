To create the "T" structure inside a 20*16 box using the given blocktypes and ab_drop('blocktype',x position) command, you can follow these steps:

1. Start with a 20*16 box.
2. Place a b11 block at position (9,0) by using the command ab_drop('b11', 9).
3. Place a b13 block at position (9,1) by using the command ab_drop('b13', 9).
4. Place a b31 block at position (8,2) by using the command ab_drop('b31', 8).

The resulting structure inside the 20*16 box will be a "T" shape.
