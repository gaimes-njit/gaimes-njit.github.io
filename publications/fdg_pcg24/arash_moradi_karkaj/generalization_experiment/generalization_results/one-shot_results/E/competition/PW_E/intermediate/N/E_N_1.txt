To generate the uppercase letter "N", you can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 8
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 9
