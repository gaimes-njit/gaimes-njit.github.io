To generate the uppercase English letter "P", you can use the following commands:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical straight block below the first horizontal block, at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical straight block next to the first vertical block, at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the second horizontal straight block below the first vertical block, at position 1

This will generate the letter "P" in the Tetris-like environment.
