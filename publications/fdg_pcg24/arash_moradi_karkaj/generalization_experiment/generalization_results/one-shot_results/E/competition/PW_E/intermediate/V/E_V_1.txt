To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can use the following stream of commands:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first block in row 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second block in column 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the third block in column 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the fourth block in column 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the fifth block in column 5
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place the sixth block in column 6
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the seventh block in column 7

This sequence of commands will create the letter "V" in the Tetris-like environment.
