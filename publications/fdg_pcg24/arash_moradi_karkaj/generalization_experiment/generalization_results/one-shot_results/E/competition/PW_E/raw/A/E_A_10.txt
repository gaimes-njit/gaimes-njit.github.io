To generate the uppercase English letter "A", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position (1,1), which represents the left side of the letter "A".
2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position (2,2), which represents the right side of the letter "A".
3. Place a square block (b11) at position (3,3), which represents the middle part of the letter "A".
4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (2,2), which represents the top part of the letter "A".
5. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position (3,3), which completes the formation of the letter "A".
