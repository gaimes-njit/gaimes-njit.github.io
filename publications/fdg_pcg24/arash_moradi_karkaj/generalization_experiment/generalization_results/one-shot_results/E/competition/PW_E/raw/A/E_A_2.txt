To generate the uppercase English letter "A", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)      # Place a horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)      # Place a vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 4)      # Place a vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 3)      # Place a horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)      # Place a vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 4)      # Place a vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 3)      # Place a vertical block at position 3
```

These commands will construct the letter "A" using the given block types and gravity rules.
