To generate the uppercase letter "A", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "A" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
