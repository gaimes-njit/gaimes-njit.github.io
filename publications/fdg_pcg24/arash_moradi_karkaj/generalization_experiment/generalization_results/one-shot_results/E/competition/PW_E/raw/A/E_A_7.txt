To generate the uppercase English letter "A", you can use the following set of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # b31 block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # b13 block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # b13 block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # b31 block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # b31 block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # b31 block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # b13 block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # b13 block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # b31 block at position 3
```

This series of commands will construct the uppercase letter "A" in the Tetris-like environment.
