To generate the uppercase English letter "B", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "B" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
