To generate the uppercase English letter "B", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will create the letter "B" using the block types and following the gravity rules in the defined environment.
