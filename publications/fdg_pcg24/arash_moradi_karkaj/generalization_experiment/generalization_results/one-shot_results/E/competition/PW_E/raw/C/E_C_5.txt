To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

This sequence will construct the letter "C" in the Tetris-like environment while ensuring structural stability according to the gravity rules.
