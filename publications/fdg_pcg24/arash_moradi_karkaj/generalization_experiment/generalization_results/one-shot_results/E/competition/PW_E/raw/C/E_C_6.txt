To generate the uppercase letter "C", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

These commands will create a letter "C" in the grid using the block types and following the gravity rules.
