To generate the uppercase English letter "C" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

Explanation:
- Start by dropping a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2.
- Then, drop a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
- Continue by dropping horizontal straight blocks ('b31') consecutively at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to form the top curve of the letter "C".
- Finally, drop a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 6 to complete the letter "C".
