To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Place the second vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place the second horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the third vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Place the fourth vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place the third horizontal straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "D" in the required environment, following the stacking and stability rules.
