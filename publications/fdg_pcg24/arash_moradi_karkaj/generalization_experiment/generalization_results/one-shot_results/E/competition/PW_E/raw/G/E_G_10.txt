To create the uppercase English letter "G", we can use the following series of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place a square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place a square block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place a square block at position 6
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Place a square block at position 7
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Place a square block at position 8
```

This series of commands will form the uppercase letter "G" within the allowed space boundaries and following the gravity rules.
