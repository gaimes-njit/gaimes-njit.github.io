To generate the uppercase English letter "G", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```
Explanation:
- First, we create the vertical straight block, b13, starting from position 1 to create the top left part of the letter "G".
- Then, we create four horizontal straight blocks, b31, starting from positions 2 to 5 to create the top bar of the "G".
- Next, we create the vertical straight block, b13, starting from position 5 to create the middle part of the letter "G".
- Finally, we create four horizontal straight blocks, b31, starting from positions 7 to 10 to create the bottom bar of the "G".

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively and adhere to the defined environment and gravity rules to ensure the stability of the letter "G" shape.
