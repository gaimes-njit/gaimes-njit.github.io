To generate the uppercase English letter "H", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Starting from the leftmost position (x=1), drop a horizontal straight block (b31) at position y=1.
2. Drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position y=1.
3. Drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position y=2.
4. Drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position y=2.
5. Drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position y=2.
6. Drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position y=3.
7. Drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position y=3.

This sequence of commands will result in the formation of the uppercase letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries and with stability according to the gravity rules.
