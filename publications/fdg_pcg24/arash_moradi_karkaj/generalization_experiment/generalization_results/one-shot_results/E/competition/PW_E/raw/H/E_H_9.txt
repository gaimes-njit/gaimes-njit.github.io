To generate the letter "H", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
ab_drop('b31', 16)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "H" in the Tetris-like environment, following the stacking and stability rules. Each command places a block of the corresponding type and position on the grid. The numbers in the commands represent the x and y coordinates, where x indicates the block type (b31 or b13) and y indicates the position along the width.
