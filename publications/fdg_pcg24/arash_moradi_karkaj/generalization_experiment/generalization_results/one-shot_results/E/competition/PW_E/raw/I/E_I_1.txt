To generate the uppercase letter "I", you can use the following stream of commands:

```bash
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1.
- The second command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places a vertical straight block at position 2.
- The third command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block at position 2.
- The fourth command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block at position 2.
- The fifth command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places another horizontal straight block at position 2.

These commands will create the shape of the letter "I" within the allowed space boundaries.
