To generate the uppercase English letter "I", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place the second horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place the third horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the vertical block at position 2 again (to increase height)
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the vertical block at position 2 once more (to increase height)
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the final horizontal block at position 1 (to increase width)
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place the final horizontal block at position 2 (to increase width)
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place the final horizontal block at position 3 (to increase width)
```

These commands will generate the uppercase English letter "I" within the allowed space boundaries, while maintaining structural stability according to the gravity rules.
