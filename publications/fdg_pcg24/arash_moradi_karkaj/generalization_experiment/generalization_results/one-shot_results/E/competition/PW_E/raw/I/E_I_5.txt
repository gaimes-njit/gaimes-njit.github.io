To generate the uppercase letter "I", the following stream of commands can be used:

``` 
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
This sequence of commands will create a vertical line with a height of 10 units, which represents the letter "I" in the grid.
