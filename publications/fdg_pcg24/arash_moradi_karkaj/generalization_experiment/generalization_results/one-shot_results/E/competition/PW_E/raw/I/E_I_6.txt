To generate the uppercase letter "I", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Explanation:
- We start by dropping a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1.
- We repeat this command four times to create the vertical lines of the letter "I".

This will result in the uppercase letter "I" formed within the allowed space boundaries.
