To generate the uppercase letter "J" using the given block types and commands, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```ab_drop('b31', 2)```
This will create the top part of the letter "J".

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
```ab_drop('b13', 1)```
This will create the vertical line on the left side of the letter "J".

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2:
```ab_drop('b13', 2)```
This will complete the vertical line on the left side of the letter "J".

4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```ab_drop('b31', 2)```
This will create the bottom part of the letter "J".

To summarize, the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the uppercase letter "J" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Please note that this solution assumes a starting position of X = 1 for each block type and follows the gravity rules specified in the instructions.
