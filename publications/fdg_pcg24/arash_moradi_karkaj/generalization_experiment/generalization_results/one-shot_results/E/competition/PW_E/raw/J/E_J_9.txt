To generate the uppercase English letter "J", you will need to use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to form the top of the "J".
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to form the vertical stroke of the "J".
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to extend the vertical stroke of the "J".
4. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 1 to form the bottom left corner of the "J".
5. Place another 1x1 square block (b11) at position 2 to continue the bottom of the "J".
6. Place one more 1x1 square block (b11) at position 3 to complete the bottom right corner of the "J".

When executed in order, these commands will create a stable structure resembling the uppercase letter "J" within the allowed boundaries of the grid.
