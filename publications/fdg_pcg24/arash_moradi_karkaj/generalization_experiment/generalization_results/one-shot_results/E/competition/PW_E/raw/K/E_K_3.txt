To generate the uppercase English letter "K" in the defined environment, we can use the following stream of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place horizontal block at position 4
```

This set of commands will generate the letter "K" with proper stacking and stability within the defined boundaries of the environment.
