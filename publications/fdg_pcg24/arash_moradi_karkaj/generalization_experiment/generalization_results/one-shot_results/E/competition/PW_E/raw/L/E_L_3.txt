To generate the uppercase English letter "L", the following ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will create an "L" shape with the horizontal straight block placed at position 1, followed by three vertical straight blocks placed at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Please note that the above commands assume the initial starting position is set to 1. If the starting position is different, you may need to adjust the y values accordingly.
