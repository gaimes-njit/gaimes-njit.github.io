To generate the uppercase English letter "L", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)    # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1)    # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)    # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)    # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
```

This series of commands will construct the letter "L" using the block types in the given environment while following the stacking and stability rules.
