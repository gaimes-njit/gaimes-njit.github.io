To generate the uppercase letter "L" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1) 
ab_drop('b13',1) 
ab_drop('b13',1) 
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation:
- The first command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at the position 1 along the width.
- The second command places a vertical straight block (b13) at the position 1 along the width.
- The third command also places a vertical straight block (b13) at the position 1 along the width.
- The fourth command places another horizontal straight block (b31) at the position 1 along the width.

By following these commands in sequential order, you will be able to construct the uppercase letter "L" within the given environment while ensuring stacking and stability.
