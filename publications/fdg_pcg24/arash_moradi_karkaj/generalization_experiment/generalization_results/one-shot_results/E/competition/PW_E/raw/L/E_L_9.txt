To generate the uppercase English letter "L", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "L" using the block types and following the gravity rules in the defined environment.
