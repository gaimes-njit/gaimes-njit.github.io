To generate the uppercase English letter "N" using the given block types in the defined environment, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "N" in the Tetris-like environment, following the stacking and gravity rules.
