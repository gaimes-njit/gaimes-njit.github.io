To generate the uppercase English letter "N" using the given block types, we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1) # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1) # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2) # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2) # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3) # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 3) # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
```

These commands will create a stable structure in the shape of the uppercase letter "N".
