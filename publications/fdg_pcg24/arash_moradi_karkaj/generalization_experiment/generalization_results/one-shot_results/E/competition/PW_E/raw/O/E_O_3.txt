ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places a horizontal straight block of width 3 units and height 1 unit at position 2 along the width.
- The second command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places a vertical straight block of width 1 unit and height 3 units at position 1 along the width.
- The third command `ab_drop('b13', 3)` places another vertical straight block of width 1 unit and height 3 units at position 3 along the width.
- The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places another horizontal straight block of width 3 units and height 1 unit at position 2 along the width.
- The fifth command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places another vertical straight block of width 1 unit and height 3 units at position 1 along the width.
- The sixth command `ab_drop('b13', 3)` places another vertical straight block of width 1 unit and height 3 units at position 3 along the width.
- The seventh command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places another horizontal straight block of width 3 units and height 1 unit at position 2 along the width.

By following these commands, the uppercase letter "O" can be generated using the given block types in the defined environment.
