To generate the uppercase letter "P", follow the stream of commands below:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)    # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)    # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)    # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',1)    # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)    # Place a square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)    # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',4)    # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11',5)    # Place a square block at position 5
ab_drop('b11',6)    # Place a square block at position 6
ab_drop('b13',3)    # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will generate the letter "P" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
