To generate the uppercase English letter "P", you can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

These commands will stack the blocks in the shape of the letter "P" within the allowed space boundaries.
