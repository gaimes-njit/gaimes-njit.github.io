P: The letter P can be constructed by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, followed by a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, and another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3. The final step is to place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4.

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
