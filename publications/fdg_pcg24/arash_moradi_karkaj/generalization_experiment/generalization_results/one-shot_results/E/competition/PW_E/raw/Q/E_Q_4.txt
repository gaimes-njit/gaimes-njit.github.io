To generate the letter "Q", we can use the following commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block at position 1.
3. Place another vertical straight block at position 4.
4. Place another vertical straight block at position 1.
5. Place another vertical straight block at position 3.
6. Place another horizontal straight block at position 1.
7. Place the second horizontal straight block at position 4.
8. Place a vertical straight block at position 2.
9. Place another vertical straight block at position 3.

These commands will construct the letter "Q" within the allowed space boundaries and with structural stability.
