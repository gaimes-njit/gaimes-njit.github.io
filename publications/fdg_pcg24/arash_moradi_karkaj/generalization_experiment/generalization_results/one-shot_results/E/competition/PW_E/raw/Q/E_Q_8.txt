To generate the uppercase English letter "Q" using the given block types and environment, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Placing the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Placing the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Placing the second vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Placing the second horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Placing the third vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Placing the fourth vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Placing the third horizontal block at position 1
```

These commands will create the uppercase letter "Q" in the Tetris-like environment, ensuring stacking and stability with the gravity rules.
