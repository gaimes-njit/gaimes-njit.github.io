To generate the uppercase English letter "R", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place the second vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place the third vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place the third horizontal straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "R" in the Tetris-like environment.
