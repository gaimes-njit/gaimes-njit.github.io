To generate the uppercase letter "R", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the third horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the fourth horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the third vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the fourth vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the fifth vertical block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the fifth horizontal block at position 5
```

Make sure to run the commands consecutively and ensure that the blocks are placed within the allowed boundaries of the grid.
