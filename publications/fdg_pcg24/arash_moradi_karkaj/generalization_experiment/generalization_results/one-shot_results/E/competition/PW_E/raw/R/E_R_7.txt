To generate the uppercase English letter "R", we need to use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Vertical straight block starting at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # 1x1 square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # 1x1 square block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Horizontal straight block at position 2

This sequence will generate the letter "R" in the Tetris-like environment.
