To generate the uppercase English letter "S", you can use the following stream of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

Explanation:
- To create the vertical line of the "S", we use `ab_drop('b31',1)` four times in a row starting from position 1.
- To create the top curve of the "S", we use `ab_drop('b13',3)` to place a vertical block at position 3, and then `ab_drop('b13',2)` and `ab_drop('b13',1)` to place three horizontal blocks starting from position 1.
- To create the bottom curve of the "S", we use `ab_drop('b13',3)` to place a vertical block at position 3, and then `ab_drop('b31',1)` and `ab_drop('b31',2)` to place two horizontal blocks starting from position 1.

By following these commands, you should be able to generate the uppercase English letter "S" within the specified environment and gravity rules.
