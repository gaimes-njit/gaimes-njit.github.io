To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we can use a combination of the block types b31 and b13. Here is the stream of commands to construct the letter "S":

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place the horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',3)   # Place the horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place the vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',4)   # Place the vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',4)   # Place the horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',5)   # Place the horizontal block at position 5
ab_drop('b13',5)   # Place the vertical block at position 5
ab_drop('b13',6)   # Place the vertical block at position 6
```

By following these commands in sequence, the blocks will be stacked and arranged in the shape of the letter "S" within the allowed space boundaries.
