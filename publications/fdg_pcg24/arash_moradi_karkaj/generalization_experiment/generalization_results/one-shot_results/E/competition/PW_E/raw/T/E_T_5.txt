To generate the uppercase English letter "T", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will first place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 to form the top part of the "T". Then, a vertical straight block ('b13') is placed at position 2 to form the middle part of the "T". Finally, another horizontal straight block ('b31') is placed at position 2 to complete the bottom part of the "T".

Note: Make sure to execute these commands consecutively in order to achieve the desired letter "T" shape.
