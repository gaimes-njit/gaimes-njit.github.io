To generate the uppercase letter "T", you can follow the instructions below using the ab_drop() command:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)          # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)          # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)          # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)          # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)          # Place another vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)          # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)          # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "T" within the allowed space boundaries and ensure structural stability with the gravity rules.
