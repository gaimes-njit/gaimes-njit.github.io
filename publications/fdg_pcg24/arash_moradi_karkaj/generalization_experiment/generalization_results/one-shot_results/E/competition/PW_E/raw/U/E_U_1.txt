To generate the uppercase English letter "U" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
   ab_drop('b31', 2)

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
   ab_drop('b13', 1)

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2:
   ab_drop('b13', 2)

4. To complete the left side of the "U", place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
   ab_drop('b31', 2)

5. Repeat steps 2-4 to create the right side of the "U":
   - Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
     ab_drop('b13', 1)
   - Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2:
     ab_drop('b13', 2)
   - Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
     ab_drop('b31', 2)

Following these steps will result in stacking the blocks in the shape of the uppercase English letter "U".
