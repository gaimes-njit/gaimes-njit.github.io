To create the uppercase letter U using the given block types and commands, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Then, place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Repeat step 1 by placing another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

5. Repeat step 2 by placing another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

6. Repeat step 3 by placing another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

7. Finally, repeat step 4 by placing another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

By following these steps and executing the corresponding ab_drop() commands consecutively, you will create the uppercase English letter U in the given environment.
