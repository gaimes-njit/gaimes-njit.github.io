To generate the uppercase letter "U", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

``` ab_drop('b31', 1) ```
``` ab_drop('b13', 1) ```
``` ab_drop('b31', 3) ```
``` ab_drop('b13', 3) ```
``` ab_drop('b31', 5) ```
``` ab_drop('b13', 5) ```

Explanation:
1. The first command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, creating the top part of the letter "U".
2. The second command places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, extending downwards from the top part.
3. The third command places another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3, completing the top part of the letter "U".
4. The fourth command places another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3, extending downwards from the top part.
5. The fifth command places another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 5, creating the bottom part of the letter "U".
6. The sixth command places another vertical straight block (b13) at position 5, extending upwards from the bottom part.

Putting it all together, we get the uppercase letter "U".
