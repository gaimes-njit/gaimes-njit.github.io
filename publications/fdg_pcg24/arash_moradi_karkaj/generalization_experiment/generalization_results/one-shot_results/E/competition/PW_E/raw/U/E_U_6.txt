To generate the uppercase letter "U", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b13',7)
ab_drop('b31',7)
```

Explanation:
- To create the first vertical line of the "U", we use the 'b31' block type and place it at position 1 along the width.
- Next, we create the left arm of the "U" by using the 'b13' block type at position 1 along the width.
- Then, we create the right arm of the "U" by using the 'b13' block type at position 3 along the width.
- To complete the "U", we create the bottom horizontal line using the 'b31' block type at position 3 along the width.
- Finally, we add stability to the structure by using the 'b13' block type to fill the gaps in the arms and bottom line.

Please note that the stream of commands may vary depending on the starting position of the letter within the allowed space.
