To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we can use the following stream of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 4
```

These commands will form the letter "V" within the allowed space and maintain structural stability according to the gravity rules.
