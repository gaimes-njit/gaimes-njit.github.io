To generate the uppercase letter "V", you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width:
``` 
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width:
``` 
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 along the width:
``` 
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width:
``` 
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

5. Repeat steps 2 and 3:
``` 
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

6. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width:
``` 
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

By following these steps, you should be able to generate the uppercase letter "V" in the Tetris-like environment.
