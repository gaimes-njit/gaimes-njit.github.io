To generate the uppercase English letter "V", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create a "V" shape using the given block types in the defined environment.
