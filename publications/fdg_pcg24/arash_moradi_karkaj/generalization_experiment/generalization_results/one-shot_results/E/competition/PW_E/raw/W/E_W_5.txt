To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we can use a combination of block types b13 and b31. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to construct the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Placing horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Placing vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Placing vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Placing horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Placing vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Placing vertical block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Placing horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Placing vertical block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Placing vertical block at position 8
```

By following these commands in order, "W" will be generated in the given environment.
