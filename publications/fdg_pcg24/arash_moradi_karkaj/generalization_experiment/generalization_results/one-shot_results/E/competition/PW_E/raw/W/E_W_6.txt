To generate the uppercase letter "W", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "W" using the block types and following the gravity rules in the defined environment. Each command places a block at a specific position, starting from x position 1 and incrementing along the width.

Make sure to follow the specified sequence and use the correct block types and positions to accurately generate the desired letter.
