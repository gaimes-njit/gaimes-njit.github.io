In order to generate the uppercase English letter "W" using the mentioned block types and commands, you can follow the steps below:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width. Repeat this step two more times to complete the middle and lower parts of the "W":
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

5. Finally, repeat steps 2 and 3 to place the vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 along the width to complete the upper part of the "W":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

When you follow these steps and execute the commands consecutively, you will successfully generate the uppercase English letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries.
