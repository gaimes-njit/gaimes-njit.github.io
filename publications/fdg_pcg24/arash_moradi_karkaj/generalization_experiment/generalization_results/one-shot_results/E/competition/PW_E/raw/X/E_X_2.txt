To generate the uppercase English letter "X", you can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place the vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Place the third horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place the fourth horizontal block at position 10
ab_drop('b13', 8)   # Place the vertical block at position 8
ab_drop('b13', 9)   # Place the vertical block at position 9
```

By executing these commands consecutively, you will generate the uppercase letter "X" using the specified block types in the given environment.
