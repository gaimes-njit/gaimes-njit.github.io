To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
- Start by dropping a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1.
- Next, drop a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
- Drop another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2.
- Drop one more horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3.
- Then, drop a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2.
- Finally, drop another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3.

This sequence of commands will result in the formation of the uppercase letter "Y" within the defined environment.
