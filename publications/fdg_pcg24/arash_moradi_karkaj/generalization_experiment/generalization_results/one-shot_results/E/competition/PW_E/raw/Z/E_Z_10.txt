The stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "Z" using the block types in the defined environment is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

Please note that the commands are separated by new lines for better readability, but in the actual implementation, they should be executed consecutively without any breaks.
