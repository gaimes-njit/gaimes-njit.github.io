To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we can use the following stream of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)       # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)       # Place the first vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)       # Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 6)       # Place the second vertical block at position 6
ab_drop('b31', 7)       # Place the third horizontal block at position 7
```

This will create the uppercase letter "Z" in the defined environment.
