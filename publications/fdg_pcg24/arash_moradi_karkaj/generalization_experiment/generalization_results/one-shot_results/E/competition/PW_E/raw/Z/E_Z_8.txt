To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "Z" in the defined environment, following the stacking and stability rules.
