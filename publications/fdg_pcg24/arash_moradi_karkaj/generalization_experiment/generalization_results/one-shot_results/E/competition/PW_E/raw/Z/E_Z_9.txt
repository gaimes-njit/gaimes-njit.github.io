The stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "Z" is:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a single 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 1.
- Then, we place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2, extending it to the right for the first part of the horizontal stroke.
- Next, we continue the horizontal stroke by placing two more horizontal straight blocks ('b31') at positions 3 and 4.
- After that, we place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 5, starting the vertical stroke downwards.
- Then, we continue the vertical stroke by placing two more vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 6 and 1 (wrapping around to the next row).
- Finally, we complete the letter by placing a single 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 3 as the endpoint of the diagonal stroke.

This sequence of commands creates a stable and accurate representation of the uppercase letter "Z" within the allowed space of the grid.
