To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) to form the stable base:
```python
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop('b11', i)
```

3. Place the horizontal blocks (b31) on top of the base blocks to form the two vertical lines of the "H":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

4. Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the horizontal blocks to form the crossbar of the "H":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

5. Ensure stability by placing additional base blocks if needed:
```python
for i in range(W):
    if structure[H-2][i] == ' ':  # If the slot is empty on the second-to-last layer
        ab_drop('b11', i)  # Place a base block
```

6. Print the resulting structure:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This code will generate a new result meeting all the given requirements. Modify the position of the blocks and the number of base blocks as needed to achieve a stable structure resembling the character "H".
