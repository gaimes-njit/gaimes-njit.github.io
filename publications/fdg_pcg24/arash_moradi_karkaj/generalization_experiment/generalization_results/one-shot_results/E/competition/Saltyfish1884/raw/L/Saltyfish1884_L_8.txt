To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code.

2. Drop a b13 block at the leftmost slot on layer 0 to create a solid base for stability.

3. Drop a b11 block on top of the b13 block to create the vertical part of the "L" shape.

4. Drop a b31 block to the right of the b11 block, aligning the center of the b31 block with the rightmost slot on layer 0. This completes the horizontal part of the "L" shape.

5. Drop another b11 block on top of the b31 block to extend the vertical part of the "L" shape.

6. The resulting structure should resemble the character "L" and meet all the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is the updated code to generate the structure:

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# drop a b13 block at the leftmost slot on layer 0
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# drop a b11 block on top of the b13 block
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# drop a b31 block to the right of the b11 block
ab_drop('b31', W-1)

# drop another b11 block on top of the b31 block
ab_drop('b11', W-1)

# print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))

The above code will generate a stable structure resembling the character "L" while satisfying all the hard constraints.
