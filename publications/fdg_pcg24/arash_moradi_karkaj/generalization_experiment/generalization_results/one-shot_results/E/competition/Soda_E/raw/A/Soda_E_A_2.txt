To generate the letter "A" in the level, we can break it down into three parts - the top horizontal bar, the slanted middle bar, and the bottom horizontal bar. 

Here's the complete implementation to create a stable structure that resembles the letter "A":

```
# The top horizontal bar of A
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

# The slanted middle bar of A
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# The bottom horizontal bar of A
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top approach and ensures that each block is balanced and well-supported. The resulting structure will resemble the letter "A" and be stable under gravity.
