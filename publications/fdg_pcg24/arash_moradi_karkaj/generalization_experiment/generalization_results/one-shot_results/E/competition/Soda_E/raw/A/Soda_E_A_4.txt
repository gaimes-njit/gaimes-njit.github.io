To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "A", we need to break it down into smaller blocks and stack them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the top horizontal bar of the "A"
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Step 2: Place the middle vertical bar of the "A"
```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Step 3: Place the bottom horizontal bar of the "A"
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Complete Implementation:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

This implementation will create a structure in the shape of the letter "A" and enforce stability by stacking the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion.
