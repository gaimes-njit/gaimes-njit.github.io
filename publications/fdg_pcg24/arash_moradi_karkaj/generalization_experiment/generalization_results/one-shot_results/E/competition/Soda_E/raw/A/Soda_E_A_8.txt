To build the letter "A", we can break it down into three parts: the top bar, the middle bar, and the bottom bar. 

Here's the complete implementation to build the letter "A":

```
# The top bar of A
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# The middle bar of A
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# The bottom bar of A
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

In this implementation, we start by building the top bar of the letter "A". We use a column block ("b13") to build the two side vertical bars and a square block ("b11") to build the middle horizontal bar. 

Next, we build the middle bar of the letter "A" using a row block ("b31").

Finally, we build the bottom bar of the letter "A" using the same blocks and positions as the top bar.

This implementation ensures stability by properly aligning and balancing the blocks. The resulting structure should resemble the letter "A" when viewed from the top.
