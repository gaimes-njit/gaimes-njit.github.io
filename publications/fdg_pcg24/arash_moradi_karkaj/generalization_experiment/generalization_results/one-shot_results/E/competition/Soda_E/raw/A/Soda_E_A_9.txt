To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "A", we can break it down into three parts: the slanting lines and the horizontal line in the middle. We'll start building the structure from the bottom and work our way up.

Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Build the bottom slanting lines:
   - Drop a "b13" block at x_position=7.
   - Drop a "b13" block at x_position=11.

2. Build the horizontal line in the middle:
   - Drop a "b31" block at x_position=9.

3. Build the top slanting lines:
   - Drop a "b13" block at x_position=6.
   - Drop a "b13" block at x_position=12.

Complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

This implementation builds the structure of the letter "A" in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability by balancing the blocks.
