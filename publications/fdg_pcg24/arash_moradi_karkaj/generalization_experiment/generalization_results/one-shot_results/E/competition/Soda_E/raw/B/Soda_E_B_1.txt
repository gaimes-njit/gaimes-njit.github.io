We will first create the left vertical line of the letter "B" by stacking two column blocks on top of each other. To do this, we will use the "b13" block type.

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

Next, we will create the bottom horizontal bar of the letter "B". We will use the "b31" block type to achieve this.

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

Now, we will create the top horizontal bar of the letter "B". We will again use the "b31" block type.

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

Finally, we will create the right vertical line of the letter "B" by stacking two column blocks on top of each other. Again, we will use the "b13" block type.

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

The complete implementation, ensuring stability and similarity to the letter "B", will be as follows:

```
# Left vertical line of the letter "B"
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 0)

# Bottom horizontal bar of the letter "B"
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)

# Top horizontal bar of the letter "B"
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)

# Right vertical line of the letter "B"
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```
