In order to generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "B" (TARGET), we can break it down into smaller components and build them one by one. 

First, let's start by creating the vertical bar of the letter "B": 

```python
# The vertical bar of the letter B
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

Next, let's create the top bar of the letter "B":

```python
# The top bar of the letter B
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

Finally, let's create the bottom bar of the letter "B":

```python
# The bottom bar of the letter B
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

By executing these ab_drop() calls in the given order, we can generate a stable structure in the shape of the letter "B".
