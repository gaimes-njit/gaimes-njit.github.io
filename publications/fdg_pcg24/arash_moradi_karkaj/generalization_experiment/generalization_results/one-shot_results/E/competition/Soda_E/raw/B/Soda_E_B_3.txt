To build the letter "B" with blocks using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into multiple blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here's a step-by-step implementation:

1. Create the bottom base of the letter "B" using a row block ("b31") centered at x_position = 9:
ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Add the vertical pipe of the letter "B" using a column block ("b13") centered at x_position = 12:
ab_drop("b13", 12)

3. Add the top base of the letter "B" using a row block ("b31") centered at x_position = 5:
ab_drop("b31", 5)

4. Add the top-right diagonal of the letter "B" using a square block ("b11") centered at x_position = 6:
ab_drop("b11", 6)

5. Add the top-left diagonal of the letter "B" using a square block ("b11") centered at x_position = 4:
ab_drop("b11", 4)

Using this sequence of ab_drop() function calls, we will generate a structure that resembles the letter "B" in the given 2D grid.
