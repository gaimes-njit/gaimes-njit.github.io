First, let's start by creating the top and bottom horizontal bars of the letter "B". We can use the row block "b31" for this. We need to place two row blocks horizontally, one on top and one at the bottom. To ensure stability, we need to center the blocks properly.

```python
# Top horizontal bar of B
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

# Bottom horizontal bar of B
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Next, let's create the two vertical columns of the letter "B" using the column block "b13". We need to place two column blocks vertically, one on the left and one on the right. Again, we need to center the blocks properly.

```python
# Left vertical column of B
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# Right vertical column of B
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
```

With these code blocks, we have created the letter "B" in the level. The blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion and are balanced, which ensures stability.

```python
# Complete implementation
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
```
