To create the letter "B" using the block-stacking technique, we can break it down into three parts: the top horizontal bar, the bottom horizontal bar, and the vertical bar in between.

Here is the code implementation to create the letter "B":

```python
# The top horizontal bar of B
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# The vertical bar of B
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 12)

# The bottom horizontal bar of B
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

This implementation drops the blocks in the following order:
1. The top horizontal bar of the "B" is created using a row block ("b31") centered at x_position=9.
2. A square block ("b11") is dropped on top of the row block at x_position=9 to complete the top bar.
3. Another row block ("b31") is dropped centered at x_position=10 to create the right end of the top bar.
4. Two column blocks ("b13") are dropped at x_positions 8 and 12 to create the vertical bar.
5. The same steps as above are repeated to create the bottom horizontal bar of the "B".

Note: The x_positions and the order of the ab_drop() calls are crucial to ensure stability and obtain the desired shape.
