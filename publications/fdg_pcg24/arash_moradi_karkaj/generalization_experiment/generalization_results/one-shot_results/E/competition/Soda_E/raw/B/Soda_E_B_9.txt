This response cannot include a code block as the specific implementation of the ab_drop() function is required to generate the desired structure. However, I can provide a step-by-step guide to help you build a structure that looks like the letter "B" using the ab_drop() function.

Step 1: Create the two vertical bars of the "B"
- Drop a column block ("b13") at position x=8.
- Drop a column block ("b13") at position x=11.

Step 2: Create the top and bottom horizontal bars of the "B"
- Drop a row block ("b31") at position x=7.
- Drop a row block ("b31") at position x=11.

Step 3: Create the middle horizontal bar of the "B"
- Drop a row block ("b31") at position x=7.
- Drop a row block ("b31") at position x=11.

Your final implementation should look like this:

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Please note that this implementation assumes that the grid is empty before starting and that the ab_drop() function will handle any stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
