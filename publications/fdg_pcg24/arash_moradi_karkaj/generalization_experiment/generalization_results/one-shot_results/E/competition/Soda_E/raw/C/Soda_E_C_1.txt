To create a structure that looks like the letter "C" in the level, we can start by building the base of the letter. We will then stack blocks on top to create the curves of the letter.

```python
# Base of the letter C
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)

# Upper part of the letter C
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

This code will create a structure that resembles the letter "C" in the level. The base of the letter is created using row blocks (`b31`), and the upper part is created using column blocks (`b13`).

Note: This implementation assumes that the grid is empty before running the code. If there are existing blocks in the grid, the code may need to be modified to avoid collisions and maintain stability.
