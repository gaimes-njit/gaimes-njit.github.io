To build a structure that looks like the capital letter "C", we can break it down into three parts: the top bar, the vertical pipe, and the bottom bar. We will start by building the vertical pipe, followed by the top bar, and then the bottom bar.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# The vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# The top bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# The bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top approach, ensuring that each block is well-supported and balanced. It will generate a structure that resembles the letter "C" and is stable.
