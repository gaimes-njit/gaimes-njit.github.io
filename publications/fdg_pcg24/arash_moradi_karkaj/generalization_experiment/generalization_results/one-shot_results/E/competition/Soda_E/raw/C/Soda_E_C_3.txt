First, I will create the base block of the "C" by dropping a row block "b31" at the bottom of the grid:

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Next, I will create the vertical bar of the "C" by dropping a column block "b13" on top of the base block:

ab_drop("b13", 9)

Finally, I will create the top horizontal bar of the "C" by dropping a row block "b31" on top of the vertical bar:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
