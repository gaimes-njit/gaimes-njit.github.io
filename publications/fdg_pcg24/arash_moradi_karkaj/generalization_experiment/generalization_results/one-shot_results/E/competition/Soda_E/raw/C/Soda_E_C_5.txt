To create a structure that looks like the capital character "C", we can break it down into three blocks: the top bar, the vertical bar, and the bottom bar. We will stack these blocks from bottom to top to ensure stability.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# The bottom bar
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# The vertical bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# The top bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This implementation will generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "C" in the level. The blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.
