To create a structure that looks like the letter "C" in the level, we can follow these steps:

1. Create the top and bottom horizontal bars of the letter "C" using the "b31" block type. Place them at appropriate positions to form the desired shape.
2. Create the vertical bar of the letter "C" using the "b13" block type. Place it at the appropriate position to connect the top and bottom bars.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Create the top horizontal bar of "C"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 8)

# Create the bottom horizontal bar of "C"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 8)

# Create the vertical bar of "C"
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```

This implementation will generate a structure in the level that looks like the letter "C" and ensures stability by following the bottom-to-top approach.
