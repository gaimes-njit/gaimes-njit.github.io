To create a structure in the shape of a capital "D", we can start by building the straight vertical line and then adding the curved part. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Start by creating the left vertical line of the "D":
```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

2. Add the top bar of the "D":
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

3. Finally, add the bottom right curved part of the "D":
```
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 13)
ab_drop("b11", 14)
ab_drop("b13", 15)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top construction technique and ensures the stability of the structure. It will generate a structure that resembles the capital letter "D" on the grid.
