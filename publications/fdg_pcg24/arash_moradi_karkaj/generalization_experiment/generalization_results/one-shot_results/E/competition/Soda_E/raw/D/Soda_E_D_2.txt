To create the letter D, we can break it down into three blocks: a bottom bar, a middle diagonal, and a top bar. We will build the structure in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the bottom bar of D
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

# Place the middle diagonal of D
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 12)

# Place the top bar of D
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

This implementation ensures stability by building the structure from bottom to top. The resulting structure should resemble the capital letter D.
