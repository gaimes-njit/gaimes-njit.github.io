To generate a structure that resembles the letter "D" in the Tetris game, we can break it down into two parts: the vertical bar and the semicircle. 

1. Vertical Bar:
To create the vertical bar, we can stack two column blocks on top of each other using the "b13" block type. This will create a stable and balanced structure.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Place the first column block
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Place the second column block on top of the first one
```

2. Semicircle:
To create the semicircle, we can place a row block on top of the vertical bar and then add two additional blocks on each side to form the curved shape. We will use the "b31" block type for the row block and the "b11" block type for the side blocks.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # Place the row block on top of the vertical bar
ab_drop("b11", 7)   # Place the left side block
ab_drop("b11", 11)  # Place the right side block
```

Overall, the complete implementation to generate the "D" structure can be written as follows:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Place the first column block
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Place the second column block on top of the first one
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # Place the row block on top of the vertical bar
ab_drop("b11", 7)   # Place the left side block
ab_drop("b11", 11)  # Place the right side block
```

This implementation ensures both stability and similarity to the target letter "D".
