To create the letter "D", we can start by building the base of the letter first. Using a row block (b31) centered at position 4, we can create the bottom part of the "D" shape.

ab_drop("b31", 4)

Next, we can build the vertical pipe of the "D" shape using a column block (b13). Placing it centered at position 3 will create the desired shape.

ab_drop("b13", 3)

Finally, we can create the top part of the "D" shape using another row block (b31) centered at position 4.

ab_drop("b31", 4)

This series of ab_drop() calls will generate a structure that resembles the letter "D" and is stable:

ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
