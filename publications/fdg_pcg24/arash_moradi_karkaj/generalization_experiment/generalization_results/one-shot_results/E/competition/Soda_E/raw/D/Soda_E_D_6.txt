To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "D" in the Tetris game, we can break it down into multiple blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation to achieve the desired structure:

1. Place the base of the "D":

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Place the vertical line of the "D":

```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

3. Place the small horizontal line at the top of the "D":

```python
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

4. Place the larger horizontal line at the top of the "D":

```python
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Combining all the steps, the complete implementation to generate the structure in the shape of the letter "D" in the Tetris game is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This implementation ensures both stability and similarity to the target shape.
