In order to create the structure that looks like the letter "D", we need to carefully drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Add the base of the letter "D":
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```

2. Add the vertical bar of the letter "D":
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

3. Add the top portion of the letter "D":
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```

4. Add the extension of the letter "D":
```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

5. Add the extension of the letter "D" on the other side:
```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

6. Add the top portion of the letter "D" on the other side:
```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
```

7. Add the vertical bar of the letter "D" on the other side:
```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

8. Add the base of the letter "D" on the other side:
```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
```

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will generate a structure that looks like the letter "D" in the level.
