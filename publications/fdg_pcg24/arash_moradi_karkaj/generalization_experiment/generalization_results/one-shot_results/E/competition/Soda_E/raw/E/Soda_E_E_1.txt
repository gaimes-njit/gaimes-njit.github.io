First, let's start by building the three horizontal bars of the letter E. We will use the lying-down orientation since it provides stability.

```
# The top horizontal bar of E
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# The middle horizontal bar of E
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)

# The bottom horizontal bar of E
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 13)
```

This will give us a stable structure for the letter E. However, the E will be flipped due to gravity. We need to rotate it clockwise to match the target orientation.

```
# Rotate the structure
# Move the top horizontal bar to the right
ab_drop("b31", 14)

# Move the middle horizontal bar to the right
ab_drop("b31", 14)

# Move the bottom horizontal bar to the right
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```

Now the E structure is correctly oriented.
