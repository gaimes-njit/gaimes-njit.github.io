To create a structure that looks like the letter "E", we can follow the given hints and drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here's the complete implementation:

```python
# The top horizontal bar of E
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# The middle horizontal bar of E
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)

# The bottom horizontal bar of E
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Note: This implementation assumes that the starting position of the first block is at the leftmost column of the grid (x_position=0) and that the blocks are dropped in the order specified above. Adjustments may be needed depending on the specific starting position and order constraints.
