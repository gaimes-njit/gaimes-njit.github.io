To create a structure that looks like the letter "E", we can follow the provided hints and drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. 

1. First, we create the base horizontal bar of the letter "E" using the "b31" block type.
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```

2. Next, we create the middle horizontal bar of the letter "E" using the "b13" block type.
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```

3. Finally, we create the top horizontal bar of the letter "E" using the "b31" block type.
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```

The complete implementation without errors is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```
