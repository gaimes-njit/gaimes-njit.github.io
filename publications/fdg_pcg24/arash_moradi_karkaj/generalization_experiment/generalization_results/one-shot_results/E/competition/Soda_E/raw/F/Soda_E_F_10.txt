To build the letter F, first, we need to create the top horizontal bar. Then, we can create the vertical bar and the bottom horizontal bar. Here's the complete implementation:

```
# The top horizontal bar of F
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)

# The vertical bar of F
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)

# The bottom horizontal bar of F
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are dropped in a bottom-to-top fashion, creating a stable structure that resembles the letter F. The F structure is centered at column 9 and has a height of 11 cells.
