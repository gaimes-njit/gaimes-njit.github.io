To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "F", we can break it down into three blocks: the top horizontal bar, the middle vertical bar, and the bottom horizontal bar. We will stack these blocks from bottom to top to ensure stability.

Here is the step-by-step implementation to build the "F" structure:

1. Build the bottom horizontal bar:
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

2. Build the middle vertical bar:
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

3. Build the top horizontal bar:
ab_drop("b31", 10)

The complete implementation is as follows:

ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
