First, we need to create the horizontal bar of the letter "F". We will use the block type "b31" and drop it at x_position=7.

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

Next, we will create the vertical bar of the letter "F". We will use the block type "b13" and drop it at x_position=8.

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Finally, we will create the top horizontal bar of the letter "F". We will use the block type "b11" and drop it at x_position=6.

```
ab_drop("b11", 6)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
```
