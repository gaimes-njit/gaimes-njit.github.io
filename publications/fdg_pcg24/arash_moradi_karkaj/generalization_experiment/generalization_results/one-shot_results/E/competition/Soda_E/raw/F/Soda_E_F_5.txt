To create the letter "F" in a level, we can use the following ab_drop() calls:

```python
# The vertical bar of F
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)

# The horizontal bar of F
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This series of ab_drop() calls will create the letter "F" in the level with the best stability and similarity. Each ab_drop() call will drop a block of the specified type and position it correctly to form the letter "F" structure.
