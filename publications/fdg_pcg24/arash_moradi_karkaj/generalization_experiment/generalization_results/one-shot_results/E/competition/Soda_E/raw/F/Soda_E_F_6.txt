To create the letter "F" in the level, we can follow these steps:

1. Create the vertical pillar of the letter "F" by using a column block (b13) placed at x_position = 9.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

2. Create the horizontal bar of the letter "F" by using a row block (b31) placed at y_position = 1.

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

3. Create the bottom bar of the letter "F" by using a row block (b31) placed at y_position = 3.

```
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

Combining all the steps, the complete implementation to create the letter "F" in the level is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```
