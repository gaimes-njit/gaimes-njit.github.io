To generate a structure that looks like the letter "F" in the 2D grid, we can follow the hints provided and build the structure block by block. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the top horizontal bar of the letter "F":
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

2. Drop the middle horizontal bar of the letter "F":
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

3. Drop the bottom vertical bar of the letter "F":
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

The complete implementation to generate the letter "F" structure in the 2D grid:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Note: The implementation assumes that the initial state of the grid is empty. If there are existing blocks or obstacles in the grid, additional checks and adjustments may be required to ensure stability and prevent errors.
