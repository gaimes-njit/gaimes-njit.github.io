To build the letter "F" using the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the top horizontal bar of the letter "F" using two blocks of type "b13" dropped at positions 7 and 9:
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

2. Next, create the vertical bar of the letter "F" using a block of type "b31" dropped at position 8:
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

3. Finally, create the bottom horizontal bar of the letter "F" using two blocks of type "b13" dropped at positions 7 and 9:
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

The complete implementation to build the letter "F" is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
