To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "G", we can break it down into smaller components:

1. Place the top horizontal bar of "G":
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

2. Place the middle vertical bar of "G":
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```

3. Place the bottom horizontal bar of "G":
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

By following these steps, the complete implementation to generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "G" would be:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
