To build a structure in the shape of the capital letter "G", we can break it down into three blocks: the top horizontal bar, the vertical pipe, and the bottom horizontal bar. We can then drop each block in the desired positions to create the desired structure.

Here's the complete implementation:

```
# The top horizontal bar of G
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

# The vertical pipe of G
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)

# The bottom horizontal bar of G
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top approach as specified in the problem. Each block is dropped in a stable position, and the resulting structure will resemble the capital letter "G".
