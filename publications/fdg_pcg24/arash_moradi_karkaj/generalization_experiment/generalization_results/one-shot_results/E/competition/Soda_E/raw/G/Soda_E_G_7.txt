First, we need to create the shape of the letter G. Based on the hints provided, we can break down the letter G into multiple blocks. Let's start by placing the blocks that form the horizontal bars of the letter G:

```python
# The top horizontal bar of G
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# The middle horizontal bar of G
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# The bottom horizontal bar of G
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Next, we can place the blocks that form the vertical part of the letter G:

```python
# The upper vertical bar of G
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

# The lower vertical bar of G
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

Finally, we need to place a block to close the gap in the upper vertical bar:

```python
# Fill the gap in the upper vertical bar of G
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

This sequence of ab_drop() calls should generate a structure that looks like the letter G. Note that the order of the ab_drop() calls is important to ensure stability.
