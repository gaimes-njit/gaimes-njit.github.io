To create the capital letter "G" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into several blocks and drop them in a sequential order. 

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

# The top horizontal bar of G
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# The vertical bar of G
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)

# The bottom horizontal bar of G
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

This implementation will create a stable structure that looks like the capital letter "G" in the level.
