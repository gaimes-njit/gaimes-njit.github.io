To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "H", we can break it down into three parts: the top horizontal bar, the middle vertical bar, and the bottom horizontal bar. Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# The top horizontal bar of H
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# The middle vertical bar of H
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# The bottom horizontal bar of H
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top construction approach and ensures stable placement of blocks.
