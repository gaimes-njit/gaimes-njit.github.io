The first step is to create the vertical bars of the H character. We will use the "b31" block type to do this. 

```
# The left vertical bar of the H
ab_drop("b31", 4)

# The right vertical bar of the H
ab_drop("b31", 15)
```

Next, we will create the horizontal bar of the H character. We will use the "b13" block type for this.

```
# The horizontal bar of the H
ab_drop("b13", 9)

ab_drop("b13", 10)

ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

Finally, we will add the middle block of the H character. We will use the "b11" block type for this.

```
# The middle block of the H
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

The complete implementation, with all the ab_drop() calls, is as follows:

```
# The left vertical bar of the H
ab_drop("b31", 4)

# The right vertical bar of the H
ab_drop("b31", 15)

# The horizontal bar of the H
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)

# The middle block of the H
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
