To create the letter "H" in the level, we need to start by building the two vertical bars on the sides and then add the horizontal bar in the middle. Here's the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 0)   # Left vertical bar (H)
ab_drop("b31", 19)  # Right vertical bar (H)
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # Middle horizontal bar (H)

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "H" in the level.
