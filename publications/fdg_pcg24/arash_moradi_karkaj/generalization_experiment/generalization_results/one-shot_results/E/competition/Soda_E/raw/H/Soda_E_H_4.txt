To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "H", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the two vertical bars of the "H":
   - Drop a column block "b13" at x_position=4
   - Drop a column block "b13" at x_position=10

2. Place the horizontal bar of the "H":
   - Drop a row block "b31" at x_position=1
   - Drop a row block "b31" at x_position=7
   - Drop a row block "b31" at x_position=13

The complete implementation will be as follows:

ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
