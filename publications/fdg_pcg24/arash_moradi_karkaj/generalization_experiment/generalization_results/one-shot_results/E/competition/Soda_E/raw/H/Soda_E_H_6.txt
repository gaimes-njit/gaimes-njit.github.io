First, we need to create the top and bottom horizontal bars of the letter "H". To do this, we can use the "b31" block type for the horizontal bars and the "b11" block type for the connecting blocks. 

Here is the implementation for the top horizontal bar:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

And here is the implementation for the bottom horizontal bar:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

Next, we need to create the vertical bar of the letter "H". We can use the "b13" block type for the vertical bar and the "b11" block type for the connecting blocks.

Here is the implementation for the vertical bar:

```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

Finally, we need to create the two connecting blocks between the top and bottom horizontal bars and the vertical bar. We can use the "b11" block type for these connecting blocks.

Here is the implementation for the left connecting block:

```
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

And here is the implementation for the right connecting block:

```
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation for creating the letter "H" in the level is:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 5)

ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 1)

ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 2)

ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

Please note that this implementation assumes that the level is initially empty. If there are already blocks in the level, the implementation will need to be modified accordingly to ensure stability and similarity to the letter "H".
