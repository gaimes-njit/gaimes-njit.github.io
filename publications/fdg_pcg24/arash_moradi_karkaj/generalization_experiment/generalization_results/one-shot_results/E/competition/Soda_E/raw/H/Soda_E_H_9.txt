To generate the structure of the capital letter "H", we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical bars and a horizontal bar in the middle.

1. Place the first vertical bar on the left side:
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

2. Place the second vertical bar on the right side:
```
ab_drop("b31", 17)
ab_drop("b31", 18)
ab_drop("b31", 19)
```

3. Place the horizontal bar in the middle:
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

By following these steps, the structure in the level will resemble the capital letter "H".
