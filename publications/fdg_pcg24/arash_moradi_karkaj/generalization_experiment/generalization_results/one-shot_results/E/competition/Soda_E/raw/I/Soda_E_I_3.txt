To generate a structure in a level that looks like the capital letter "I", I will first drop a row block at the bottom of the grid to serve as the base. Then, I will drop a column block on top of the base to create the vertical line of the "I". Finally, I will drop another row block on top of the vertical line to complete the "I" shape.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Drop the base row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Drop the vertical column block
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Drop the top row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are stacked from the bottom to the top, creating a stable structure in the shape of the capital letter "I".
