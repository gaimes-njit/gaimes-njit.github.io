First, we need to create the top and bottom horizontal bars of the letter "I". 

Since the orientation is top-down, we can use the "b31" block type to represent each horizontal bar.

Here is the code to create the top horizontal bar:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

Next, let's create the bottom horizontal bar:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

Now, we need to create the vertical bar in between the horizontal bars. We can use the "b13" block type to represent the vertical bar.

```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Finally, let's ENFORCE the stability by adding the gravity constraint. 

```
# I is already stable and doesn't require additional blocks for stability.
```
