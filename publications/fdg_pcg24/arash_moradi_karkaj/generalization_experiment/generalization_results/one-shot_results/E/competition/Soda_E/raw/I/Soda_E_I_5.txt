To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "I" (TARGET), we can start by dropping a row block at the center of the grid. This will form the base of the "I" structure. Then, we can drop a column block on top of the row block to form the vertical line of the "I". Finally, we can drop another row block on top of the vertical line to complete the "I" structure.

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
