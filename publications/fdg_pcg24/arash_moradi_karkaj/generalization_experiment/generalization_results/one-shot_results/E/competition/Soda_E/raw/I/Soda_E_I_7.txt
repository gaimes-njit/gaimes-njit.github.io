To build the structure that looks like the capital letter "I", we need to start by placing the base blocks and then adding the upper blocks. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the base blocks
```
# The bottom horizontal bar of I
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Step 2: Place the upper blocks
```
# The top horizontal bar of I
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

With these steps, we have successfully generated a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "I".
