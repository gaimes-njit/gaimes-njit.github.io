First, let's build the base of the letter "I" using two row blocks. The top row block will be placed at x_position=9 and the bottom row block at x_position=10.

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

Next, we need to build the middle part of the letter "I" using a column block. The column block will be placed at x_position=10.

ab_drop("b13", 10)

Finally, we need to build the top of the letter "I" using a row block. The row block will be placed at x_position=9.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
