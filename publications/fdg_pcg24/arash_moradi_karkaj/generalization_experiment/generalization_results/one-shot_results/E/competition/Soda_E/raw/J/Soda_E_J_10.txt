To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital letter "J", we need to place blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. 

1. Place the bottom tick of the letter "J":
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Place the middle pipe of the letter "J":
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

3. Place the top bar of the letter "J":
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```

The complete implementation to generate the structure of the letter "J" in the level is as follows:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```
