To generate a structure that looks like the letter "J" in the Tetris game, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the bottom tick of the "J" shape:
   - ab_drop("b31", 9)
   - ab_drop("b11", 10)

2. Place the middle pipe of the "J" shape:
   - ab_drop("b11", 9)
   - ab_drop("b13", 10)

3. Place the top bar of the "J" shape:
   - ab_drop("b31", 9)
   - ab_drop("b11", 10)

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)

ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
