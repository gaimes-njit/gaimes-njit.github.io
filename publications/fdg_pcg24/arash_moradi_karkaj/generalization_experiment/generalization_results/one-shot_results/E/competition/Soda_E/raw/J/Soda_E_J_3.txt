To generate the capital letter "J" in the level, we will start by creating the base and then adding the vertical bar and bottom tick.

The first step is to create the base of the "J" structure. We will use a row block (`b31`) for this. Since the grid has a width of 20 columns, we will place the block at position 9 to create a stable base. 

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we will add the vertical bar of the "J" structure. We will use a column block (`b13`) for this. We will place the block at position 8 to align it with the leftmost edge of the base.

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Finally, we will add the bottom tick of the "J" structure. We will use a row block (`b31`) for this. We will place the block at position 7 to align it with the bottom left corner of the vertical bar.

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

The complete implementation to generate the "J" structure in the level is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This implementation ensures both stability and similarity to the capital letter "J".
