To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "J", we need to build it in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the bottom tick of the letter "J":
ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Place the middle pipe of the letter "J":
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

3. Place the top bar of the letter "J":
ab_drop("b31", 10)

The complete implementation for creating a structure that looks like the capital letter "J" is as follows:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
