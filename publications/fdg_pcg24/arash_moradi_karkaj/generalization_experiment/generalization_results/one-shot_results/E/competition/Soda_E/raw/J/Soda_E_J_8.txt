To create a structure that looks like the letter "J" in the level, we can follow the hints provided and break it down into three blocks - a top bar, a middle pipe, and a bottom tick.

Here's the step-by-step implementation to create the "J" structure:

1. Place the top bar (bottom-up):

   ab_drop("b31", 4)
   
2. Place the middle pipe (bottom-up):

   ab_drop("b13", 3)
   
   ab_drop("b11", 4)
   
3. Place the bottom tick (bottom-up):

   ab_drop("b13", 4)
   
   ab_drop("b11", 5)

Complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
