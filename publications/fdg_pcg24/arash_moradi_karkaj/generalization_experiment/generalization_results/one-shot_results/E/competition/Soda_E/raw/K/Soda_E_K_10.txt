To create a structure that looks like the letter "K", we will first create the vertical pipe, then the top horizontal bar, and finally the bottom horizontal bar. 

Here is the code to create the "K" structure:

```python
# Drop the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)

# Drop the top horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# Drop the bottom horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

This code will create a structure that looks like the letter "K" when viewed in top-down orientation. Please note that the horizontal bars are dropped at the same y-coordinate to ensure stability.
