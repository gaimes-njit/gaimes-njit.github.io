To create the letter "K" in the level, we can start by building the two vertical bars and then adding the horizontal bar in the middle. Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# The left vertical bar of K
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# The right vertical bar of K
ab_drop("b31", 14)
ab_drop("b31", 15)
ab_drop("b31", 16)

# The horizontal bar of K
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are stacked from bottom to top and creates a structure that resembles the letter "K".
