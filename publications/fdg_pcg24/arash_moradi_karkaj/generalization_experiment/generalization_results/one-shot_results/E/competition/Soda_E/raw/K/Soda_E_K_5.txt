To build the letter "K" using the given ab_drop() function, we can break it down into three parts: one vertical column, one horizontal bar, and another vertical column. We'll place these blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. 

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the bottom vertical column
ab_drop("b31", 2)

# Place the bottom horizontal bar
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)

# Place the top vertical column
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

The above code will create a structure that looks like the letter "K" at the beginning and will remain stable.
