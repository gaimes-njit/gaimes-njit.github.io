To create the letter "K" using block stacking, we can break it down into three parts: the vertical bar, the diagonal arm, and the horizontal bar. 

To ensure stability, we will start from the bottom and work our way up. Each block placement should be carefully chosen to maintain stability.

Here is the step-by-step code to create the letter "K":

```
# Place the bottom horizontal bar of 'K'
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

# Place the diagonal arm of 'K'
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
ab_drop("b11", 14)
ab_drop("b13", 15)

# Place the vertical bar of 'K'
ab_drop("b31", 15)
```

This code will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "K". Each block is carefully placed to maintain stability and generate the desired shape.

Feel free to modify the code or ask for further clarification if needed.
