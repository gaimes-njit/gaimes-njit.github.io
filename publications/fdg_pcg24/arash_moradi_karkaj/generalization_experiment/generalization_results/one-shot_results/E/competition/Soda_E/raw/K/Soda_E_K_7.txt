To create the letter "K" in the level, we need to drop blocks in a specific order and position. The "K" consists of 5 blocks: two vertical columns, one horizontal bar, and two diagonals. 

Here is the step-by-step implementation to create the letter "K":

1. Drop the first vertical column (left side):
```python
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

2. Drop the horizontal bar:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```

3. Drop the second vertical column (right side):
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

4. Drop the diagonal lines:
```python
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```

Complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```
