First, let's build the bottom bar of the "K" character by dropping a row block (`b31`) in the appropriate position.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
```

Next, let's build the vertical bar of the "K" character by dropping a column block (`b13`) on top of the bottom bar.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

Finally, let's build the diagonal bar of the "K" character by dropping a row block (`b31`) diagonally on top of the vertical bar.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

This completes the implementation to create a structure resembling the "K" character. Note that the positions and order of the `ab_drop()` calls are crucial for achieving stability and similarity to the target character.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
