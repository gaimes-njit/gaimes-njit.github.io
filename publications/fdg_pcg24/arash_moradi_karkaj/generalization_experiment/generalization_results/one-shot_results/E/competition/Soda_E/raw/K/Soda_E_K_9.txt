To create the letter "K" in the level, we can break it down into three parts: the two diagonal bars and the horizontal bar in the middle. We will start by building the diagonal bars from bottom to top, followed by the horizontal bar.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Create the left diagonal bar of "K"
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 11)

ab_drop("b13", 16)
ab_drop("b11", 15)

# Create the right diagonal bar of "K"
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 13)

ab_drop("b13", 16)
ab_drop("b11", 17)

# Create the horizontal bar of "K"
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 16)
```

This implementation first builds the left diagonal bar of "K" in the following pattern:
- Drop a column block (b13) at position 8
- Drop a square block (b11) at position 9
- Repeat the above two steps for the second row
- Repeat the above two steps for the third row

Then, it builds the right diagonal bar of "K" in a similar pattern:
- Drop a column block (b13) at position 8
- Drop a square block (b11) at position 9
- Repeat the above two steps for the second row
- Repeat the above two steps for the third row

Finally, it creates the horizontal bar of "K" by dropping three column blocks (b13) at positions 8, 12, and 16.

This implementation ensures that the blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion, and the structure is stable and resembles the letter "K".
