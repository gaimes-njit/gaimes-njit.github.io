The first step is to create the vertical pipe for the letter 'L'. This can be done by stacking two 'b31' blocks on top of each other at the leftmost position of the grid.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)  # First row of the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 0)  # Second row of the vertical pipe
```

Next, we need to create the bottom bar of the 'L'. We can do this by stacking three 'b11' blocks horizontally at the bottom row of the grid, starting from the cell at position 0.

```python
ab_drop("b11", 0)  # Leftmost block of the bottom bar
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Middle block of the bottom bar
ab_drop("b11", 2)  # Rightmost block of the bottom bar
```

Now, let's put it all together in the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)  # First row of the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 0)  # Second row of the vertical pipe

ab_drop("b11", 0)  # Leftmost block of the bottom bar
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Middle block of the bottom bar
ab_drop("b11", 2)  # Rightmost block of the bottom bar
```

This implementation will create a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter 'L', with optimal stability and similarity to the target shape.
