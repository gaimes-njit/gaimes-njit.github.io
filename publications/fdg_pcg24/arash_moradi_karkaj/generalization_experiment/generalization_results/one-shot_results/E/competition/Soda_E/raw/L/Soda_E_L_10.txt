To create the capital letter L, we can break it down into two blocks: a vertical pipe and a bottom bar.

1. Place the vertical pipe at the leftmost column (x_position = 0):
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

2. Place the bottom bar just below the vertical pipe:
```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

By following these steps, we can create the capital letter L structure in the level.
