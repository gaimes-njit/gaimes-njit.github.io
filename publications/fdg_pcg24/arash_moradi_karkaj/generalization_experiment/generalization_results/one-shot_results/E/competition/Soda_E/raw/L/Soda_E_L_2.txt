The first step is to create the vertical pipe of the letter "L" at the left edge of the grid. We will use the block type "b31" for this.

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
```

Now we need to create the bottom bar of the letter "L". We will use the block type "b13" for this.

```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

The complete implementation to create the letter "L" would be:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

This implementation creates a stable structure that resembles the letter "L".
