In this solution, we will build the capital letter "L" using the block-stacking techniques and the ab_drop() function. We will start by placing the long vertical column block "b31" and then add the horizontal bar block "b13" to complete the "L" shape.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Place the vertical column block "b31" at the bottom-left corner of the grid
ab_drop("b31", 0)

# Place the horizontal bar block "b13" above the vertical column block
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

This code will drop the required blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, creating a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "L".
