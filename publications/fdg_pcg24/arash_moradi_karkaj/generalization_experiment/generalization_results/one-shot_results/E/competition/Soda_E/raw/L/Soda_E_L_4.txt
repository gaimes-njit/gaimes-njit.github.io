To create the capital letter "L" using the ab_drop() function, we need to stack two blocks: a vertical pipe and a bottom bar. Both blocks should be placed in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Place the vertical pipe (bottom bar)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Place the bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

By following these steps, we can create the capital letter "L" in a stable and balanced manner.
