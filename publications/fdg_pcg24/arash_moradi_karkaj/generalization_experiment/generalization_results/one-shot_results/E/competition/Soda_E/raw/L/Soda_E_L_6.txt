In order to generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "L" in the Tetris game, we can follow the hints provided and build the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion while ensuring stability.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Drop the bottom horizontal bar of L
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)

# Drop the vertical pipe of L
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Drop the top horizontal bar of L
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```

This implementation follows the orientation suggested for the letter "L" and ensures that the blocks are balanced and well-supported to resist gravity.

Note: It is assumed that the game environment automatically enforces stability and prevents boundary intrusion.
