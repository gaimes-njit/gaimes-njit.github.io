To create the capital letter "L" in the level, we will need two blocks: a vertical pipe and a bottom bar. 

First, we will create the vertical pipe block using the "b31" block type. We will center it at position 5 (x_position=5) to ensure it is balanced. Then, we will create the bottom bar block using the "b13" block type. We will center it at position 6 (x_position=6) to ensure it is aligned with the bottom of the vertical pipe.

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
