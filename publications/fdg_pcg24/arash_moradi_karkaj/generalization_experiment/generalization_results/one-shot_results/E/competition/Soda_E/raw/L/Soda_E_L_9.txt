To generate the structure in the shape of the capital letter "L", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() calls:

1. Create the base of the "L" shape:
ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Create the vertical part of the "L" shape:
ab_drop("b11", 8)

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will create a stable structure in the shape of the capital letter "L".
