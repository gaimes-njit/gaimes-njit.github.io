To generate a structure in the shape of the letter M, we can break it down into three sections: the two outer vertical bars and the central slanted line. 

First, we will build the two vertical bars by using the column block "b13" and placing it at the appropriate x-positions. 

Then, we will create the central slanted line by using the row block "b31" and placing it at the appropriate x-position.

Here's the complete implementation to generate the letter M:

```
# The left vertical bar of M
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 7)

# The central slanted line of M
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# The right vertical bar of M
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 16)
```

This implementation ensures stability by placing each block in a bottom-to-top fashion. It also creates a structure that looks like the letter M when viewed from the top-down orientation.
