First, let's start with the baseline implementation of the letter "M". We will build it using the natural orientation (top-down).

```
# The left side of the M
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# The right side of the M
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
ab_drop("b11", 15)
ab_drop("b13", 16)
```

This will create a stable "M" structure in the level.

However, this implementation can be improved to achieve a better similarity score by considering the flipping technique mentioned in the hints section. So, let's try to achieve the same "M" structure using the flipped orientation.

```
# The top horizontal bar of the M
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# The bottom horizontal bar of the M
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This implementation will also create a stable "M" structure in the level.

Now, we have two different implementations that result in the same "M" structure. We can choose either one based on stability and similarity.
