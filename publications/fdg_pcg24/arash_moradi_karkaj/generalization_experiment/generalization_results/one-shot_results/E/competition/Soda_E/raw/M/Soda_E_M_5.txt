To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "M", we can break it down into three segments: the left slant, the middle vertical, and the right slant. We will build each segment using the provided ab_drop() function. 

First, we will start with the left slant segment. 

```
# Left slant segment
ab_drop("b13", 7)

ab_drop("b11", 6)

ab_drop("b13", 5)

ab_drop("b11", 4)

ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

Next, we will build the middle vertical segment. 

```
# Middle vertical segment
ab_drop("b31", 11)

ab_drop("b11", 10)

ab_drop("b31", 9)

ab_drop("b11", 10)

ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Finally, we will build the right slant segment. 

```
# Right slant segment
ab_drop("b13", 13)

ab_drop("b11", 14)

ab_drop("b13", 15)

ab_drop("b11", 16)

ab_drop("b13", 17)
```

By placing these blocks in the specified order, we will create a structure that looks like the capital letter "M" when viewed from the top-down orientation.
