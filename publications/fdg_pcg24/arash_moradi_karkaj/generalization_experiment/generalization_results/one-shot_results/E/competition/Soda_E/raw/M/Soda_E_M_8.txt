First, we can start by building the bottom part of the "M" shape. We will use a row block ("b31") in the center of the grid and two square blocks ("b11") on either side of it. This will form the basic structure of the "M" shape.

```
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Next, we can build the middle part of the "M" shape. We will use a column block ("b13") and place it below the left and right square blocks to form the downward strokes of the "M".

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Finally, we can build the top part of the "M" shape. We will use a row block ("b31") and place it above the middle column block.

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

The complete implementation to generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "M" is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Please note that this is just one possible solution and there may be other ways to achieve the desired structure.
