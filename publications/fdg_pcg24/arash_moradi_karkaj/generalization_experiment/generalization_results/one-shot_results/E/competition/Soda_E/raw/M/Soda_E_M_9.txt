In order to generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "M", we can break it down into three parts: the two outer columns and the middle column. 

First, let's start with the two outer columns:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 19)
```

Next, let's add the middle column:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

This will create a structure in the level that looks like the letter "M".
