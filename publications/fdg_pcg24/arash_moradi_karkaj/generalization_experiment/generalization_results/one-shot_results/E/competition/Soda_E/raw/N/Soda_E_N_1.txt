To build the letter "N" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical pipes and a horizontal bar in the middle. Here's the step-by-step implementation to create a stable and similar "N" structure:

1. Drop the first vertical pipe:
   ab_drop("b31", 2)

2. Drop the first horizontal bar:
   ab_drop("b11", 3)

3. Drop the second vertical pipe:
   ab_drop("b31", 4)

4. Drop the second horizontal bar:
   ab_drop("b11", 5)

5. Drop the third vertical pipe:
   ab_drop("b31", 6)

By following these steps, you will have a stable "N" structure that looks similar to the target character.
