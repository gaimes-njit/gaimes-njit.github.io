To create the letter "N" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: the left vertical pipe, the diagonal crossbar, and the right vertical pipe. 

To create the left vertical pipe, we can use a "b31" block dropped at x_position=2:
```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

Next, we need to create the diagonal crossbar. We can use a "b13" block dropped at x_position=5:
```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```
Then, we need to create the right vertical pipe. We can use a "b31" block dropped at x_position=8:
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to create the letter "N" in the level is:
```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```
This implementation ensures the best stability and similarity to the letter "N".
