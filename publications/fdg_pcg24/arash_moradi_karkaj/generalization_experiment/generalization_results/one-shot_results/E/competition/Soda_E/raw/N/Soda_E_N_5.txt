To build the structure in the shape of the capital letter "N", we will follow the provided hints.
First, we will create the left vertical bar of the letter "N" using a column block:

```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

Next, we will create the diagonal line of the letter "N" using a row block:

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Finally, we will create the right vertical bar of the letter "N" using another column block:

```
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```
