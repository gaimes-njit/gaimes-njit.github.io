To achieve a structure that looks like the letter "N", we need to build it in a bottom-to-top fashion. We will start by placing the base blocks and then add the upper blocks.

1. Place the base blocks:
   - Place a row block at the center of the grid: `ab_drop("b31", 7)`
   - Place a column block at the center of the grid, one position to the right: `ab_drop("b13", 8)`
   - Place a row block at the center of the grid, two positions to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 9)`

2. Place the upper blocks:
   - Place a row block at the top-left corner of the grid, one position to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 0)`
   - Place a column block at the top-left corner of the grid, two positions to the right: `ab_drop("b13", 1)`
   - Place a row block at the top-left corner of the grid, three positions to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 2)`

3. Adjust the positions of the upper blocks:
   - Move the row block at the top-left corner one position to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 1)`
   - Move the column block at the top-left corner two positions to the right: `ab_drop("b13", 2)`
   - Move the row block at the top-left corner three positions to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 3)`

4. Adjust the positions of the upper blocks again:
   - Move the row block at the top-left corner one position to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 2)`
   - Move the column block at the top-left corner two positions to the right: `ab_drop("b13", 3)`
   - Move the row block at the top-left corner three positions to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 4)`

5. Adjust the positions of the upper blocks once more:
   - Move the row block at the top-left corner one position to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 3)`
   - Move the column block at the top-left corner two positions to the right: `ab_drop("b13", 4)`
   - Move the row block at the top-left corner three positions to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 5)`

6. Adjust the positions of the upper blocks:
   - Move the row block at the top-left corner one position to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 4)`
   - Move the column block at the top-left corner two positions to the right: `ab_drop("b13", 5)`
   - Move the row block at the top-left corner three positions to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 6)`

7. Adjust the positions of the upper blocks:
   - Move the row block at the top-left corner one position to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 5)`
   - Move the column block at the top-left corner two positions to the right: `ab_drop("b13", 6)`
   - Move the row block at the top-left corner three positions to the right: `ab_drop("b31", 7)`

The complete implementation, ensuring both stability and similarity, is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)

ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)

ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)

ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)

ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)

ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This implementation will generate a structure resembling the letter "N" in the level.
