To build the letter "N" in the level, we will need to create three blocks: the left vertical bar, the diagonal bar, and the right vertical bar. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

```
# Step 1: Create the left vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 5)

# Step 2: Create the diagonal bar
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# Step 3: Create the right vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 16)
ab_drop("b11", 15)

```

This implementation will generate a structure that looks like the letter "N". Please note that the specific x-positions used in the ab_drop() calls may not be optimal for stability and similarity. Adjusting the x-positions may be necessary to achieve better results.
