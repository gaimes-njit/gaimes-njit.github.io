To create the letter "N" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into three parts: the left vertical bar, the diagonal middle bar, and the right vertical bar. We will create each part separately and then combine them to form the complete "N" shape.

To create the left vertical bar, we'll use the b31 block type. We can drop it at the center position of the leftmost column (x_position=0).

ab_drop("b31", 0)

To create the diagonal middle bar, we'll use the b13 block type. We can drop it at the center position of the second column (x_position=1).

ab_drop("b13", 1)

To create the right vertical bar, we'll again use the b31 block type. We can drop it at the center position of the third column (x_position=2).

ab_drop("b31", 2)

Here's the complete code implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
