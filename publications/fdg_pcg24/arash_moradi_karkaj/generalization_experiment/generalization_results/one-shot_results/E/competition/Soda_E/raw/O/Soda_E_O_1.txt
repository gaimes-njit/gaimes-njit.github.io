The first step is to create the base of the "O" shape. We can achieve this by dropping a row block (b31) at the bottom center of the grid. Since the width (W) is 20, the center position will be at x_position 9.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The next step is to add the left and right sides of the "O" shape. We can achieve this by dropping column blocks (b13) on both sides of the base. 

```
# Left side
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# Right side
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 15)
```

Finally, we can add the top of the "O" shape by dropping a row block (b31) at the top center of the grid. Since the height (H) is 16, the top center position will be at x_position 9.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)

ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 15)

ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
