To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital character "O" (TARGET), we can start by dropping the required blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, following the gravity direction.

First, we will create the bottom row of the "O" shape using a row block (b31). We will center it at x_position=9.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we will drop a column block (b13) on each side of the bottom row to create the sides of the "O" shape. We will center them at x_position=8 and x_position=10, respectively.

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Finally, we will drop a row block (b31) on top of the bottom row to complete the "O" shape. We will center it at x_position=9.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The complete implementation to generate the "O" shape using the ab_drop() function is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "O".
