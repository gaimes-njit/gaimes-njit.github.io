First, we need to create the outer ring of the capital letter "O". We can achieve this by placing rows of "b31" blocks at the top and bottom of the level, and columns of "b13" blocks at the left and right sides. This will create the outer ring for stability.

Next, we can fill in the inner area of the "O" with either "b11" or "b13" blocks. We will choose "b11" blocks for simplicity.

Finally, we need to adjust the positions of the blocks to ensure stability and achieve the best similarity to the target. We can do this by trial and error, making small adjustments to the positions of the blocks until we are satisfied with the result.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Outer ring
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 19)
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 19)

# Adjust positions
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 15)
ab_drop("b11", 16)
ab_drop("b11", 17)

# Inner area
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 13)

# Adjust positions
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 14)
ab_drop("b11", 15)
```

Please note that the positions of the blocks and the number of adjustments may vary depending on the specific requirements and the desired similarity to the target. The above code provides a starting point, and further adjustments can be made to improve stability and similarity.
