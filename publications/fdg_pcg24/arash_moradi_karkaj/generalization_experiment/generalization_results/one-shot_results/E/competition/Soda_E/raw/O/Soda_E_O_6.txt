To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "O", we can start by building the outer ring of the letter and then fill it in with the inner blocks. 

Here's the step-by-step implementation:

```python
# Step 1: Build the outer ring of the "O"
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 14)

# Step 2: Fill in the inner blocks of the "O"
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
```

This implementation starts by placing two "b31" blocks vertically to form the top and bottom lines of the letter "O". Then, four "b13" blocks are placed horizontally to form the left and right sides of the letter.

Next, four "b11" blocks are placed to fill in the inner area of the letter "O", creating a structure that resembles the target.

Please note that this implementation assumes that the level is already empty and does not violate any constraints.
