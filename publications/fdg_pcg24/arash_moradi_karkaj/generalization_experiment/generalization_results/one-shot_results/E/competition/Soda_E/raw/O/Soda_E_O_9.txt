To create the letter "O" in the level, we can start by placing a row block at the center of the bottom row. Then, we can place a column block above the row block, centered at the same position. Finally, we can place another row block above the column block, centered at the same position.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the bottom row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Place the column block above the row block
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Place the top row block above the column block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation will create a structure in the level that looks like the letter "O" when viewed from the top-down orientation. The blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.
