To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "P" (TARGET), we can utilize the hints provided to drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. 

First, let's create the base of the "P":

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Drop a row block at x_position=9 for the base
ab_drop("b11", 8)  # Place a square block at x_position=8 for stability
ab_drop("b11", 10)  # Place another square block at x_position=10 for stability
```

Next, let's create the upright line of the "P":

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Drop a row block at x_position=9 for the upright line
ab_drop("b11", 8)  # Place a square block at x_position=8 for stability
ab_drop("b11", 10)  # Place another square block at x_position=10 for stability
```

Finally, let's create the top horizontal line of the "P":

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Drop a row block at x_position=9 for the top horizontal line
ab_drop("b11", 8)  # Place a square block at x_position=8 for stability
ab_drop("b11", 10)  # Place another square block at x_position=10 for stability
```

This implementation follows the technique of building the structure from bottom to top and ensures stability by placing square blocks at either side of each block. It also generates a structure that resembles the letter "P" (TARGET) when viewed from the top of the grid.

Note: The provided code assumes that the `ab_drop()` function is already defined and handles error cases appropriately.
