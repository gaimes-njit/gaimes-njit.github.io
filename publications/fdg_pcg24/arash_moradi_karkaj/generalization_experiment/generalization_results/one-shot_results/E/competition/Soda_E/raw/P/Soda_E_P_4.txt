This is the step-by-step implementation to generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital character "P":

Step 1: Place the horizontal bar of the letter "P"
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Step 2: Place the vertical bar of the letter "P"
```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```
