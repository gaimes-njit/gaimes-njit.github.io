To create a structure in the shape of the letter "P", we can follow these steps:
1. Create the vertical bar of the letter "P" using two column blocks.
2. Create the horizontal bar of the letter "P" using a row block.
3. Create the bottom tick of the letter "P" using a column block.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Create the vertical bar of the letter "P"
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)

# Create the horizontal bar of the letter "P"
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)

# Create the bottom tick of the letter "P"
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

By following these steps, we have created a structure that resembles the letter "P".
