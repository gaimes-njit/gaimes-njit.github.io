To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "P", we can break it down into three blocks: a vertical bar, a horizontal bar at the top, and a horizontal bar in the middle. We can start by placing the vertical bar at the leftmost position, followed by the top horizontal bar, and then the middle horizontal bar. 

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
# Place the vertical bar at the leftmost position
ab_drop("b13", 0)

# Place the top horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)

# Place the middle horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```

This implementation will create a structure that resembles the letter "P" on the 2D grid.
