To create the shape of the letter "Q", we will need to drop multiple blocks in a specific order and position. We will start by building the outer outline of the letter, then fill in the inner parts. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the top horizontal bar of "Q":
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

2. Drop the left vertical bar of "Q":
```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

3. Drop the bottom horizontal bar of "Q":
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

4. Drop the right vertical bar of "Q":
```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

5. Fill in the inner part of "Q":
```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

By following these steps, we will create a structure that resembles the letter "Q". The blocks are dropped in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability, and the final structure will match the target shape.
