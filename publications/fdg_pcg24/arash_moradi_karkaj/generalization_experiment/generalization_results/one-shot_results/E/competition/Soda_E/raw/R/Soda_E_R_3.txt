To create the letter "R" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully drop the blocks in a specific order to ensure stability and similarity. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Create the vertical line of the letter "R":
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 8)

2. Create the top horizontal line of the letter "R":
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

3. Create the bottom diagonal line of the letter "R":
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

By following these steps, we can create a structure in the level that looks like the letter "R".
