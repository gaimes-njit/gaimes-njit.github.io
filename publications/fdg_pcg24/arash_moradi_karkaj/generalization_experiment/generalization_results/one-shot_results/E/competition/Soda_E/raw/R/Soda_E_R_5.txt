To build the structure that looks like the letter "R", we can break it down into three parts: the vertical pipe, the top bar, and the bottom bar. We will build each part separately, ensuring stability and then combine them to form the final structure.

1. Building the vertical pipe:
To create the vertical pipe, we can use the "b31" block type.

ab_drop("b31", 2)

2. Building the top bar:
To create the top bar, we can use the "b13" block type.

ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)

3. Building the bottom bar:
To create the bottom bar, we can use the "b13" block type.

ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)

Final implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
