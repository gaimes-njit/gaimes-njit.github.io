To generate the letter "R" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into three parts: the vertical stroke, the diagonal stroke, and the bottom horizontal stroke. 

First, we create the vertical stroke of the "R". We will use a column block "b13" and center it in the third column (x_position=2). 

# Vertical stroke of "R"
ab_drop("b13", 2)

Next, we create the diagonal stroke of the "R". We will use a row block "b31" and center it in the fourth row (x_position=15).

# Diagonal stroke of "R"
ab_drop("b31", 15)

Now, we create the bottom horizontal stroke of the "R". We will use a row block "b31" and center it in the twelfth row (x_position=8).

# Bottom horizontal stroke of "R"
ab_drop("b31", 8)

That's it! We have successfully created the letter "R" using the ab_drop() function. The complete implementation is as follows:

ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Vertical stroke of "R"
ab_drop("b31", 15) # Diagonal stroke of "R"
ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Bottom horizontal stroke of "R"
