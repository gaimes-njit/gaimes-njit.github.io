The first step is to create the bottom horizontal bar of the letter R. To do this, we will drop a row block (b31) centered at position 9.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we will create the diagonal bar of the letter R. To do this, we will drop a column block (b13) centered at position 6, and then drop a row block (b31) centered at position 9.

```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Finally, we will create the top horizontal bar of the letter R. We will drop a row block (b31) centered at position 9, and then drop a column block (b13) centered at position 6.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

The complete implementation to generate the letter R in the level, ensuring the best stability and similarity, is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This will create a structure in the level that looks like the letter R.
