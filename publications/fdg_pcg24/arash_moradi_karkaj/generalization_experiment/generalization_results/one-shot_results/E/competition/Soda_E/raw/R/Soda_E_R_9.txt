First, we need to create the vertical bar of the letter "R". We can achieve this by dropping a column block ("b13") at the center of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the diagonal stroke of the "R". To do this, we will drop a diagonal row block ("b31") at the center-left position of the grid, followed by a diagonal row block at the center-right position of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```

Finally, we need to add the horizontal bar of the letter "R". We can achieve this by dropping a row block ("b31") at the bottom of the grid, centered at the position where the diagonal strokes meet.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to generate the letter "R" is:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
