To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "S" in the level, we can break it down into smaller blocks and place them in a bottom-to-top fashion. 

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the bottom bar of the "S"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

# Place the middle bar of the "S"
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)

# Place the top bar of the "S"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

In this implementation, we first place the bottom bar of the "S" by dropping three single blocks centered at columns 6, 7, and 8, and then adding a row block centered at column 7. 

Next, we place the middle bar of the "S" by dropping three single blocks centered at columns 6, 7, and 8.

Finally, we place the top bar of the "S" by repeating the same steps as the bottom bar. 

This implementation ensures the stability of the structure by adding the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, and it also generates a structure that looks like the capital letter "S".
