To create the letter "S" in the level, we can break it down into three parts: the top horizontal bar, the middle vertical bar, and the bottom horizontal bar.

Here is the code to create the "S" shape:

```python
# The top horizontal bar of S
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)

# The middle vertical bar of S
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# The bottom horizontal bar of S
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

This code will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "S" when seen from the top-down orientation.

Please note that the above implementation assumes that the bottom-left corner of the grid has coordinates (0, 0). If your grid has a different coordinate system, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.
