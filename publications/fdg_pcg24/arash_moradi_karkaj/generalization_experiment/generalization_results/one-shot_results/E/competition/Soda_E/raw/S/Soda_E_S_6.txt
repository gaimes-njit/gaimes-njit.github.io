First, let's start by building the base of the "S" shape. We will use the row block "b31" and place it in the center of the grid. We will drop it at position 9, which means it will occupy cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, let's add the top and bottom horizontal bars of the "S" shape. We will use the square block "b11" and place it one cell above and below the base row block.

```
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Now, let's add the two diagonal lines of the "S" shape. We will use the column block "b13" and place it diagonally above and below the base row block.

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

Finally, let's add the center vertical line of the "S" shape. We will use the row block "b31" and place it vertically in the center of the grid, intersecting with the base row block.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The complete implementation to generate an "S" shape in the level would be as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
