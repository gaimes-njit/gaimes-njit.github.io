To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital character "S" (TARGET), we can follow these steps:

1. Build the base of the "S" shape by dropping a row block at the bottom-left corner of the grid:
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

2. Add the vertical bar of the "S" shape by dropping a column block on top of the base, centered at column 1:
```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

3. Add the horizontal bar of the "S" shape by dropping a row block on top of the vertical bar, centered at column 2:
```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

4. Add the upper part of the "S" shape by dropping a row block on top of the horizontal bar, centered at column 1:
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

5. Add the top horizontal line of the "S" shape by dropping a row block on top of the upper part, centered at column 0:
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

6. Finally, add a small stabilizing block on top of the top horizontal line to ensure stability:
```
ab_drop("b11", 0)
```

The complete implementation, ensuring the best stability and similarity, is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b11", 0)
```

By following these steps, the structure will resemble the letter "S" and be stable.
