First, we need to build the bottom horizontal bar of the letter S. We can use the row block "b31" to achieve this. We will start at position x = 4 and drop the block. 

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

Next, we need to build the middle vertical bar of the letter S. We can use the column block "b13" for this. We will start at position x = 7 and drop the block. 

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

Now, we need to add the top horizontal bar of the letter S. We can use the row block "b31" again and start at position x = 4. 

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

Finally, we need to add the diagonal extension of the letter S. We can use the square block "b11" to achieve this. We will start at position x = 5 and drop the block. 

```
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

The final implementation, with all the ab_drop() calls, is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
