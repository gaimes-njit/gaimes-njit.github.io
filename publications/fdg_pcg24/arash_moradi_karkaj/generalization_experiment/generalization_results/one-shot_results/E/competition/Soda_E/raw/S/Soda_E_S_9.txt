To create the letter "S" in the Tetris game, we can break it down into two components: the top curve and the bottom curve.

To create the top curve, we can use a row block (`b31`) and a column block (`b13`). We will drop the row block first at the center of the grid, and then drop the column block just above it.

To create the bottom curve, we can again use a row block and a column block. However, this time we will drop the column block first at the center of the grid, and then drop the row block just above it.

Here is the code implementation to create the letter "S":

```
# The top curve of S
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# The bottom curve of S
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

This implementation ensures stability and generates a structure that looks like the letter "S" in the game.
