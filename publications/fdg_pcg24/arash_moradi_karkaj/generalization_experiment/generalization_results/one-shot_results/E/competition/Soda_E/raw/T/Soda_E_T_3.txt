To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "T" (TARGET), we can follow the bottom-to-top approach and drop the blocks in a specific order to ensure stability and similarity. Here is the code block sequence for creating the "T" structure:

```python
# Drop the base of the T
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)

# Drop the vertical bar of the T
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Drop the top cross of the T
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 12)

# Drop the horizontal bar of the T
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

This code block sequence will create a stable structure in the shape of the letter "T".
