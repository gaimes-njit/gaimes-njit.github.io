First, we need to create the top horizontal bar of the letter "T". We can achieve this by dropping two "b31" blocks at x_position=4 and x_position=12. This will create a stable horizontal bar:

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

Next, we need to add the vertical bar of the letter "T". We can achieve this by dropping a "b13" block at x_position=8. This will create a stable vertical bar connected to the horizontal bar:

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Lastly, we need to create the bottom horizontal bar of the letter "T". We can achieve this by dropping three "b31" blocks at x_positions 2, 8, and 14. This will create a stable bottom horizontal bar connected to the vertical bar and the top horizontal bar:

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```

The complete ab_drop() implementation to create a stable and similar letter "T" structure is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```
