To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "T", we can start by creating the vertical bar and then adding the horizontal bar on top of it. We can achieve this using the ab_drop() function with the appropriate block types and positions.

Here is the complete implementation to generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "T":

```python
# Step 1: Create the vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# Step 2: Create the horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Explanation:
1. First, we create the vertical bar by dropping a row block ("b31") at x_position 9. This will occupy cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0). Then, we add three square blocks ("b11") on top of the row block to stabilize it.
2. Next, we create the horizontal bar by dropping a column block ("b13") at x_position 8. This will occupy cells (8, 1), (8, 2), and (8, 3). Then, we drop a row block ("b31") at x_position 9 to connect the vertical and horizontal bars. Finally, we drop another column block ("b13") at x_position 10 to complete the horizontal bar.

This implementation ensures stability by properly balancing the blocks, and it results in a structure that looks like the capital letter "T".

Please note that I have assumed a top-down orientation for the letter "T" based on the given hints. If you need a different orientation, please let me know.
