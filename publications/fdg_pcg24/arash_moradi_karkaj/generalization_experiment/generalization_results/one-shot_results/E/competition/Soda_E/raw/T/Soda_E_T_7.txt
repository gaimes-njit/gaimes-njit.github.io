To create a structure that looks like the letter "T", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the vertical bar of the "T" at the center:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Place the horizontal bar of the "T" on top of the vertical bar:
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "T".
