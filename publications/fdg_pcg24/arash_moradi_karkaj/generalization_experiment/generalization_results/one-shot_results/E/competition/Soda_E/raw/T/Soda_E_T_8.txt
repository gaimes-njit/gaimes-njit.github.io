To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "T", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the vertical bar of the "T" using a column block (b13):
   ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place the vertical bar at x_position=9

2. Place the horizontal bar of the "T" using a row block (b31):
   ab_drop("b31", 7)  # Place the horizontal bar at x_position=7

The complete implementation to create a "T" structure is as follows:

ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
