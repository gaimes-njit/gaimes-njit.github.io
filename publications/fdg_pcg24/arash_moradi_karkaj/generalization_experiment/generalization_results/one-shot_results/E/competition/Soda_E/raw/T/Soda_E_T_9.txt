To create a structure that looks like a capital 'T', we will build it in a bottom-to-top fashion using the ab_drop() function. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Start by creating the vertical bar of the 'T':
   - Place a column block of size 1*3 at x_position=9.
   - Place a square block of size 1*1 at x_position=8.

2. Create the horizontal bar of the 'T':
   - Place a row block of size 3*1 at x_position=7.

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```
