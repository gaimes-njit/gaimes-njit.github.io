First, we need to create the bottom bar of the 'U' shape. We can achieve this by dropping a row block ('b31') at the center position (x_position = 9).

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Next, we need to create the vertical lines of the 'U'. We can achieve this by dropping two column blocks ('b13') on both sides of the bottom bar.
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

Finally, we need to create the horizontal line of the 'U'. We can achieve this by dropping a row block ('b31') on top of the vertical lines.
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

The complete implementation to create the 'U' shape in the level is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
