To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "U" (TARGET), we can break it down into three blocks: the top bar, the bottom bar, and the vertical pipe connecting them. We will stack these blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.

1. Place the bottom bar:
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 13)

2. Place the vertical pipe:
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)

ab_drop("b11", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
ab_drop("b11", 15)

3. Place the top bar:
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 13)

This completes the implementation. The blocks have been placed in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability, and the resulting structure resembles the letter "U".
