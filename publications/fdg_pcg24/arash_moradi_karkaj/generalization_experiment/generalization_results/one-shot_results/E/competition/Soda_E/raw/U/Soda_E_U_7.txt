To create a structure that looks like the letter "U" in the level, we can use the ab_drop() function to strategically place the blocks. 

First, we need to create the base of the "U" shape. We can use a row block "b31" and place it at the bottom of the level. 

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Next, we need to create the side pillars of the "U" shape. We can use column blocks "b13" and place them on either side of the base. 

```python
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

Finally, we need to create the top bar of the "U" shape. We can use a row block "b31" and place it at the top, connecting the two side pillars. 

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

By following these steps, the complete implementation to generate a "U" shape in the level would be as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```
