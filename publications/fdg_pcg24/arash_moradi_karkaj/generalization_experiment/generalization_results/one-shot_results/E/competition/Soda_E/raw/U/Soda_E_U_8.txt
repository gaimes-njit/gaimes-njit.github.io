To generate the letter "U" on the 2D grid, we can use the following ab_drop() calls to create the structure:

```
# Step 1: Create the base of the "U"
ab_drop("b31", 7)   # Bottom bar of "U"
ab_drop("b31", 12)  # Bottom bar of "U"

# Step 2: Create the sides of the "U"
ab_drop("b13", 4)   # Left side of "U"
ab_drop("b13", 15)  # Right side of "U"

# Step 3: Create the top of the "U"
ab_drop("b31", 7)   # Top bar of "U"
ab_drop("b31", 12)  # Top bar of "U"
```

By following these steps, we can build the "U" structure on the 2D grid.
