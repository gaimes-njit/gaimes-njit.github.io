To build the letter "U" in the level, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the left vertical bar of the "U":
```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

2. Place the bottom horizontal bar of the "U" using two row blocks:
```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

3. Place the right vertical bar of the "U":
```
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```
