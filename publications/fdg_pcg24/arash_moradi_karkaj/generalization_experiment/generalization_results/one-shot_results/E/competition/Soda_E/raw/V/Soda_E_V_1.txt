To create a capital "V" shape in the level, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing the base of the "V" shape. This can be done by dropping a row block ("b31") at the center of the grid.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Next, we need to place the two sides of the "V" shape. These can be done by dropping two column blocks ("b13") on either side of the base, at a distance of 3 units from the center.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

3. Finally, we can add an additional row block at the top of the "V" shape to make it more stable.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The complete implementation to create the "V" shape would be as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
