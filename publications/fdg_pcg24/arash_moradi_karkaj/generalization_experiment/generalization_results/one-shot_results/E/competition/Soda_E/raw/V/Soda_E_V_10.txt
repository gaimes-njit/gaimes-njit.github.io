First, let's start by creating the left side of the "V" shape. We can do this by dropping a row block (b31) at the center of the grid.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Next, let's create the right side of the "V" shape. We can do this by dropping a row block (b31) at the center of the grid.

ab_drop("b31", 10)

Great! Now we have the basic structure of the "V" shape. But we need to add the diagonal lines to complete the shape.

To create the top diagonal line, we can drop a column block (b13) at the center of the grid.

ab_drop("b13", 9)

To create the bottom diagonal line, we can drop a column block (b13) at the center of the grid.

ab_drop("b13", 10)

And that's it! We have successfully created the "V" shape.

Here's the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
