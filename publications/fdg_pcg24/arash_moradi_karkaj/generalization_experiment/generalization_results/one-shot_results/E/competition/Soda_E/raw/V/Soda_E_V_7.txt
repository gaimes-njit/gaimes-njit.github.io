To create a structure that looks like the letter "V", we can break it down into two blocks: a diagonal line going from the top left to the bottom center, and a diagonal line going from the top right to the bottom center.

Here is the complete implementation to create the V structure:

```
# The top left diagonal line of V
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# The top right diagonal line of V
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 10)

# The bottom center part of V
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

This implementation starts by dropping the top left diagonal line of the V. We use the "b13" block type to create a diagonal line that spans three cells horizontally at a time. The blocks are dropped starting from x_position=7 and continue for three cells. Then, we repeat the process for the top right diagonal line, starting from x_position=11.

Finally, we drop a single "b11" block at x_position=9 to complete the bottom center part of the V structure. This block serves as the meeting point for the two diagonal lines.

With this implementation, we ensure that the blocks are stacked in a bottom-to-top fashion and are well-supported, resulting in a stable structure. The resulting structure resembles the capital letter "V".
