To create a structure that looks like a capital "V" (TARGET), we can start by placing the bottom two blocks of the "V" shape using the "b13" block type. We will center these blocks at a specific x-position to ensure stability.

Here is the code to place the bottom two blocks:

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

Now, we have the bottom part of the "V" shape. To create the top part, we will use the "b11" block type and place three blocks on top of the bottom part. Again, we will center these blocks at a specific x-position for stability.

Here is the code to place the top three blocks:

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```

Putting it all together, here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```
