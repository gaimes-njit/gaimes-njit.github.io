To create the letter "V" using blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can start by creating the base of the letter, which consists of two column blocks placed one cell away from each other. This will form the bottom corners of the "V".

Then, we need to create the two diagonal arms of the "V". We can do this by placing row blocks diagonally above the base blocks and extending towards the center. 

Here's the complete implementation to create the letter "V":

```
# Place the base blocks
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Left base block
ab_drop("b13", 6)  # Right base block

# Place the diagonal arm blocks
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Left diagonal arm
ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Right diagonal arm
```

This implementation will generate a structure that resembles the letter "V" and meets the stability and similarity requirements.
