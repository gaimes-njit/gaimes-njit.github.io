First, let's start by creating the left leg of the "W" character:

# The left column of W
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 4)

Then, let's create the center column of the "W" character:

# The center column of W
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 6)

Finally, let's create the right leg of the "W" character:

# The right column of W
ab_drop("b31", 14)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 12)

Overall, the complete implementation to generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital character "W" would be as follows:

# The left column of W
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 4)

# The center column of W
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 6)

# The right column of W
ab_drop("b31", 14)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
