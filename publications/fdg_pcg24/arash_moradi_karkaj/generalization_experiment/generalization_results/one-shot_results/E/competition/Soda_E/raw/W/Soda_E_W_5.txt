To create the capital letter "W", we can break it down into three blocks: two diagonal bars and a horizontal bar in the middle. We will start by building the bottom diagonal bars first, and then add the horizontal bar in the middle.

Here is the implementation of the ab_drop() function calls to create the letter "W":

# Place the bottom left diagonal bar
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)

# Place the bottom right diagonal bar
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 13)

# Place the horizontal bar in the middle
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

This implementation creates a stable structure that resembles the letter "W" when viewed from a top-down orientation.

Please note that the code provided assumes that the previous blocks have been cleared and the grid is empty before starting to build the "W" structure. This is just a snippet of code for building the "W" structure and does not include any error handling or other logic that might be needed in a complete implementation of the game.
