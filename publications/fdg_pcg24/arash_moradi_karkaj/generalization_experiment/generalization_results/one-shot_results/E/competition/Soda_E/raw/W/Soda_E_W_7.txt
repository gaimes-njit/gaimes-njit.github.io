To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "W", we can divide it into three parts: the left diagonal, the middle vertical bar, and the right diagonal. 

To create the left diagonal, we can use two column blocks ("b13"). We will stack them in a bottom-to-top fashion to form a diagonal shape. 

To create the middle vertical bar, we can use a row block ("b31"). We will drop it in the center of the grid.

To create the right diagonal, we will follow a similar approach as the left diagonal but in a mirrored manner. We will stack two column blocks ("b13") in a bottom-to-top fashion again.

Here's the complete implementation:

```
# The left diagonal of W
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 4)

# The middle vertical bar of W
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# The right diagonal of W
ab_drop("b13", 15)
ab_drop("b13", 17)
```

By following these steps, we have generated a structure that looks like the capital letter "W" in the level.
