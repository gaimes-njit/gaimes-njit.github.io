To create the letter "W" in the level, we can break it down into three parts: the top V, the middle bridge, and the bottom V. We will start by creating the top V.

1. Create the top V:
- Place a row block (b31) at the center of the grid at x_position=9.
- Place a column block (b13) at the left side of the row block with x_position=8.
- Place a column block (b13) at the right side of the row block with x_position=10.

2. Create the middle bridge:
- Place a column block (b13) at the left side of the row block with x_position=6.
- Place a column block (b13) at the right side of the row block with x_position=12.

3. Create the bottom V:
- Place a row block (b31) at the center of the grid at x_position=4.
- Place a column block (b13) at the left side of the row block with x_position=3.
- Place a column block (b13) at the right side of the row block with x_position=5.

The final implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 12)

ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```
