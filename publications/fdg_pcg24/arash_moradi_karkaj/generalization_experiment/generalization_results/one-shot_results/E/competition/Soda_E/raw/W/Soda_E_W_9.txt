1. First, let's create the two diagonal lines of the "W" in its natural orientation. To do this, we need to stack two column blocks on top of each other with an offset.

```
# The left diagonal line of the "W"
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)

# The right diagonal line of the "W"
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

2. Then, let's create the top bar of the "W" using a row block.

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

3. Now, let's create the bottom bar of the "W" using a row block.

```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

4. Lastly, let's create the middle bar of the "W" using a row block.

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

The complete implementation:
```
# The left diagonal line of the "W"
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)

# The right diagonal line of the "W"
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# The top bar of the "W"
ab_drop("b31", 6)

# The bottom bar of the "W"
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# The middle bar of the "W"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```
