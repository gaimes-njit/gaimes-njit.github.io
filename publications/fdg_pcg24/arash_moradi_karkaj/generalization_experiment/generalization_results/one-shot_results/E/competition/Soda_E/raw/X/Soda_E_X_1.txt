To create the letter "X" in the level, we can break it down into three sections: the top-left diagonal, the top-right diagonal, and the middle bar. 

To create the top-left diagonal, we need to place two blocks diagonally, one above the other. We can use the "b11" block type for this. 

To create the top-right diagonal, we also need two blocks, but we need to rotate them to form the diagonal. We can use the "b11" block type and rotate it clockwise. 

Finally, to create the middle bar, we need to place a row block ("b31") horizontally in the middle of the level. 

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b11", 1)   # Top-left block, bottom position
ab_drop("b11", 0)   # Top-left block, top position
ab_drop("b11", 18)  # Top-right block, bottom position, rotated
ab_drop("b11", 19)  # Top-right block, top position, rotated
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # Middle bar

This code ensures that the blocks are placed in the correct order and positions to form an "X" shape. It also meets the stability and similarity constraints.
