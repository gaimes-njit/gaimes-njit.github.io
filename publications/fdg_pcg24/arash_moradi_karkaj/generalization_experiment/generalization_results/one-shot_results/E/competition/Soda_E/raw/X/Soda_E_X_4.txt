To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "X" in the level using the ab_drop() function, we can follow the following steps:

1. Place the bottom-left arm of the "X":
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 8)
   ab_drop("b11", 9)
   ```

2. Place the top-right arm of the "X":
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 11)
   ab_drop("b11", 12)
   ```

3. Place the central part of the "X":
   ```
   ab_drop("b11", 10)
   ```

By following these steps, we can create a structure in the level that resembles the capital letter "X". The ab_drop() function is used to drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability and proper positioning.

Complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Bottom-left arm of "X"
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)  # Central part of "X"
ab_drop("b13", 11)  # Top-right arm of "X"
ab_drop("b11", 12)
```
