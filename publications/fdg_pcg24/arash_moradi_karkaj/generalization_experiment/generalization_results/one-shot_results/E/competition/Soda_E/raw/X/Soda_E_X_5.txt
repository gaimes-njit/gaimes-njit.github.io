To create the letter X in a level, we can use the following ab_drop() calls to build the structure:

```python
# Build the left diagonal of X
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)

# Build the middle diagonal of X
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# Build the right diagonal of X
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```

This code will drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, creating the letter X shape. It ensures stability by aligning the blocks properly and avoids any errors.
