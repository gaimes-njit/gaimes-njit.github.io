To build the structure in the shape of a capital "X" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we need to first create the base of the X and then build the upper part. Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Build the base of the X
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

# Build the upper part of the X
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

This implementation creates a stable structure that resembles the capital "X". Each `ab_drop()` call places a block in the grid according to the provided block type and x_position. By strategically placing the blocks, we achieve the desired shape.
