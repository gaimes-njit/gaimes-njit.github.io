To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "X" (TARGET), we can break it down into two diagonal blocks and a center block. The structure will be built from bottom to top, ensuring stability.

1. Drop the bottom left diagonal block:
ab_drop("b11", 5)

2. Drop the bottom right diagonal block:
ab_drop("b11", 14)

3. Drop the center block:
ab_drop("b11", 9)

The complete implementation is as follows:

ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 14)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
