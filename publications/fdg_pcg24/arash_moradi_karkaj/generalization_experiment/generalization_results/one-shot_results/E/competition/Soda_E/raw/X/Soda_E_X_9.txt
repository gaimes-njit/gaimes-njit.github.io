To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "X" in the Tetris game, we can follow these steps:

1. Drop the two diagonal blocks from the top to form the slanted lines of the "X".
2. Drop the horizontal bar block to form the middle of the "X".
3. Adjust the positions of the blocks to achieve stability and better similarity.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Drop the first diagonal block of the "X"
ab_drop("b11", 4)

# Drop the second diagonal block of the "X"
ab_drop("b11", 15)

# Drop the horizontal bar block to form the middle of the "X"
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# Adjust positions for stability and better similarity
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
ab_drop("b11", 13)
```

Note: The positions and order of the blocks may vary slightly, but the overall structure should resemble the capital letter "X" in the end.
