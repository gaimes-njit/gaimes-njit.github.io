To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "Y", we can follow these steps:

1. Create the vertical bar of the letter "Y":
   - Drop a column block "b13" at the center position of the grid (x_position = 10).
   - Drop a square block "b11" on top of the column block at x_position-1.
   - Drop another square block "b11" on top of the column block at x_position+1.

2. Create the upper diagonal bar of the letter "Y":
   - Drop a row block "b31" at the position (x_position-2, 4).

3. Create the lower diagonal bar of the letter "Y":
   - Drop a row block "b31" at the position (x_position+2, 8).

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Create the vertical bar of the letter "Y"
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 11)

# Create the upper diagonal bar of the letter "Y"
ab_drop("b31", 8)

# Create the lower diagonal bar of the letter "Y"
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```
