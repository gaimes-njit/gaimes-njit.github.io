To build the capital character "Y" on the 2D grid using the ab_drop() function, we need to break it down into three parts: the top part, the middle part, and the bottom part. 

1. Top Part of "Y":
   - We can use a column block ("b13") to create the vertical line of the top part of "Y".
   - To center it, we need to place it at x_position 9.
   - The column block will occupy cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).
   - The code for the top part of "Y" would be:
   
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 9)
   ```

2. Middle Part of "Y":
   - We can use a row block ("b31") to create the horizontal line of the middle part of "Y".
   - To center it, we need to place it at x_position 9.
   - The row block will occupy cells (7, 1), (8, 1), and (9, 1).
   - The code for the middle part of "Y" would be:
   
   ```
   ab_drop("b31", 9)
   ```

3. Bottom Part of "Y":
   - We can use another column block ("b13") to create the vertical line of the bottom part of "Y".
   - To center it, we need to place it at x_position 9.
   - The column block will occupy cells (8, 2), (9, 2), and (10, 2).
   - The code for the bottom part of "Y" would be:
   
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 9)
   ```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to build the capital character "Y" would be:

```
# The top part of "Y"
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# The middle part of "Y"
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# The bottom part of "Y"
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
