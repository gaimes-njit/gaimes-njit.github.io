To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "Y", we can break it down into three parts: the base, the stem, and the arms. By dropping the blocks in the correct order and position, we can create a stable structure that resembles the target shape.

Here is the complete implementation to generate a "Y" shape:

```
# Base of the Y
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)

# Stem of the Y
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 10)

# Arms of the Y
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 13)
```

This implementation first creates the base of the "Y" by dropping five column blocks in a row. Then, it adds the stem by placing a row block in the center and adding two square blocks on either side. Finally, it creates the arms of the "Y" by placing two column blocks on the left and right sides of the stem, with two square blocks on either side of each column.

This implementation ensures stability by building the structure from the bottom up and adding blocks in a balanced manner. It also achieves similarity to the target shape by accurately positioning and ordering the blocks to resemble a capital "Y".
