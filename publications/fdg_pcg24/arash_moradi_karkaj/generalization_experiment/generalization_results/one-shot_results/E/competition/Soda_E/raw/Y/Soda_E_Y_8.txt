To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Y" in the Tetris game, we can follow these steps:

1. Create the bottom part of the "Y":
- Drop a row block ("b31") at an appropriate x_position to form the base of the "Y".

2. Create the top-left part of the "Y":
- Drop a column block ("b13") above the base block, centered at x_position-1.

3. Create the top-right part of the "Y":
- Drop a column block ("b13") above the base block, centered at x_position+1.

Here is the complete implementation to generate a "Y" structure:

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Bottom part of "Y"
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Top-left part of "Y"
ab_drop("b13", 11)  # Top-right part of "Y"
```

By following these steps, we can generate a structure in the level that looks like the letter "Y" with the best stability and similarity.
