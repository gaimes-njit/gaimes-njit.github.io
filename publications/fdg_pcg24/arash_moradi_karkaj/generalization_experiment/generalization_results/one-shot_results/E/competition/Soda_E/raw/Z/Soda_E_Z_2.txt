To create the letter Z, we need to stack blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. We can start with the base of the letter and then build upwards. Here is the implementation:

```
# The base of Z
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# The middle horizontal bar of Z
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 6)

# The top diagonal bar of Z
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

This implementation will create a structure that resembles the letter Z. The blocks are stacked in a way that ensures stability and similarity to the target character.
