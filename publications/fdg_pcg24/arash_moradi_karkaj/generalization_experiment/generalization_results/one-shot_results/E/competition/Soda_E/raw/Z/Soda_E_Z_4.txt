To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "Z" (TARGET), we can break it down into three blocks: the top horizontal bar, the middle diagonal bar, and the bottom horizontal bar. Following the hints provided, we can create the letter "Z" by dropping the blocks one by one:

```python
# The top horizontal bar of Z
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

# The middle diagonal bar of Z
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)

# The bottom horizontal bar of Z
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 19)
```

This implementation will generate a stable structure that resembles the letter "Z" (TARGET) in the level.
