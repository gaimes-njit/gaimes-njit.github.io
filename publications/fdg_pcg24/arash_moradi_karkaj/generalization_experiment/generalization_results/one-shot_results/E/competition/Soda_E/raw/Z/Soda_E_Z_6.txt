To generate a structure in the shape of the letter Z, we can break it down into three blocks: a vertical pipe, a diagonal bar, and a horizontal bar. We will start from the bottom and work our way up.

First, we will drop the vertical pipe at the leftmost position:
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

Next, we will drop the diagonal bar at the center position:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

Finally, we will drop the horizontal bar at the rightmost position:
```
ab_drop("b31", 19)
ab_drop("b11", 18)
ab_drop("b11", 17)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)

ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)

ab_drop("b31", 19)
ab_drop("b11", 18)
ab_drop("b11", 17)
```
