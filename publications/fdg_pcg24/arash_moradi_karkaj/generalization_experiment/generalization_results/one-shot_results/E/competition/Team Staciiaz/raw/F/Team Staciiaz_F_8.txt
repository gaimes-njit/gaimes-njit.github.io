To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function and follow these steps:

1. Place the horizontal block 'b31' at slot 6, centered at layer 3, to form the upper part of the "F".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

2. Place the vertical block 'b13' at slot 5, centered at layer 7, to form the middle part of the "F".

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

3. Place the vertical block 'b13' at slot 5, centered at layer 12, to form the lower part of the "F".

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "F" and meet all the constraints.

Here is the complete code to generate the structure:

```python
# Initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # Code for the ab_drop() function

# Place the horizontal block for the upper part of the "F"
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Place the first vertical block for the middle part of the "F"
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Place the second vertical block for the lower part of the "F"
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Note that the specific slot and layer positions were chosen to create a stable structure. The exact slot and layer positions may vary depending on the specific variations of the block shapes and the goal size.
