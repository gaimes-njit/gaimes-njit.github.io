To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "G" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Find a suitable drop position for each block type to form the shape of the character "G".

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at an appropriate position to create the vertical line of the "G" shape. This block should be dropped at a slot near the left boundary to minimize boundary intrusion. Use the `ab_drop()` function with the block type 'b13' and an appropriate x_position.

3. Drop two b31 blocks on top of the b13 block to create the horizontal line of the "G" shape. These blocks should be dropped at appropriate slots to maintain stability and avoid boundary intrusion.

4. Finally, drop a b11 block on top of the horizontal line to complete the shape of the "G". This block should be dropped at a central slot to maintain stability and avoid boundary intrusion.

Here's an example of using the `ab_drop()` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the character "G" and meets all the constraints:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

# Define the drop positions for each block type
b13_drop_pos = 1  # Drop the b13 block at slot 1
b31_drop_pos = 2  # Drop the b31 blocks at slot 2 and slot 3
b11_drop_pos = 10  # Drop the b11 block at slot 10

# Drop the blocks to form the shape of the character "G"
ab_drop('b13', b13_drop_pos)
ab_drop('b31', b31_drop_pos)
ab_drop('b31', b31_drop_pos + 1)
ab_drop('b11', b11_drop_pos)
```

This will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "G" and meets all the constraints. Adjust the drop positions as needed to achieve the desired appearance and stability.
