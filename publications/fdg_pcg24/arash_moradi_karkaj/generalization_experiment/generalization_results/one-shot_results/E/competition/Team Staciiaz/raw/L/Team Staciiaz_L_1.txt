To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully drop the blocks in a way that satisfies the constraints. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Set the base layer by dropping a `b31` block at slot 10 using `ab_drop('b31', 10)`.
2. Drop a `b11` block at slot 10 using `ab_drop('b11', 10)`.
3. Drop a `b11` block at slot 10 using `ab_drop('b11', 10)`.
4. Drop a `b13` block at slot 7 using `ab_drop('b13', 7)`.

This sequence of block drops will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" and satisfies all the given constraints.
