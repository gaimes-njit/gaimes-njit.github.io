To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the given constraints, the following steps can be followed:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. First, drop a `b31` block at slot 2 (center aligned) using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
This will create the base of the "L" shape.

3. Next, drop a `b13` block at slot 3 (center aligned) using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This will create the vertical part of the "L" shape above the base.

4. To complete the horizontal part of the "L" shape, drop another `b31` block at slot 3 (center aligned) using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

5. The final structure will look like the following:

```
       xxxx
       xxxx
       xxxx
xxxx   x   
xxxx   x   
xxxx   x   
```

This structure meets the goal and satisfies the stability constraint, as all the blocks are stacked vertically on top of each other. Additionally, it also meets the no boundary intrusion constraint, as there is no part of any block intruding on the boundary of the map.

Note: The exact position and order of dropping the blocks may vary, as long as the resulting structure meets all the given constraints.
