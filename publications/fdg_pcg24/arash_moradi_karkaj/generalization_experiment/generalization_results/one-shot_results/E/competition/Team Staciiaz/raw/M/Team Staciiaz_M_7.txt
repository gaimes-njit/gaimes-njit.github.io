To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "M" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in a strategic way. The strategy involves dropping the blocks in a specific order and position to achieve stability and avoid boundary intrusion.

Here is a step-by-step approach to generate the stable structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` variable provided:
   ```
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the first horizontal block `b31` to form the middle part of the "M". We can start by dropping it at slot 8 (to align the block center with the slot):
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ```

3. Drop the two vertical blocks `b13` on both sides of the middle block to form the outer parts of the "M". We can start by dropping them at slots 4 and 12:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 4)
   ab_drop('b13', 12)
   ```

4. Drop the second horizontal block `b31` on top of the middle block to complete the "M". We can drop it at slot 8:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ```

5. The final structure should resemble the character "M" and meet all the constraints.

By following this specific order and position for dropping the blocks, we ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion in the structure.
