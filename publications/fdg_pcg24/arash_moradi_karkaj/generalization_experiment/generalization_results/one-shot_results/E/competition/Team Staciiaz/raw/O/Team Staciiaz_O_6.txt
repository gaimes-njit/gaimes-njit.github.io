To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "O," we can start by dropping a vertical block (b13) at the center slot of the bottom layer (layer 0).

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Next, we can drop two horizontal blocks (b31) above the vertical block on the first and second layers. These blocks will form the top and bottom parts of the character "O."

```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Drop on the first layer
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Drop on the second layer
```

To complete the structure, we need to drop two more vertical blocks (b13) on top of the horizontal blocks. These blocks will connect the top and bottom parts of the character "O."

```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Drop on the third layer
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Drop on the fourth layer
```

The final structure will look like the character "O" and will be stable since the blocks are properly placed to distribute the weight evenly.
