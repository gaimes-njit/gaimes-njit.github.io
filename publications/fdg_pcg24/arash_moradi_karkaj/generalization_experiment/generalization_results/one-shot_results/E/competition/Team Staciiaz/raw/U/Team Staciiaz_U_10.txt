To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "U" and meets all the constraints, we need to strategically use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in the correct positions and order. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. First, we need to drop the bottom horizontal block (b31) to create the base of the structure. We can use the `ab_drop('b31', 9)` function to drop the block at the center slot of the map (slot 9). This will create a stable base.

2. Next, we need to drop the vertical blocks (b13) on both sides of the base to form the sides of the "U" shape. We can use the `ab_drop('b13', 0)` function to drop the left vertical block at the leftmost slot (slot 0), and `ab_drop('b13', 18)` function to drop the right vertical block at the rightmost slot (slot 18).

3. Finally, we need to drop the top horizontal block (b31) to complete the "U" shape. We can use the `ab_drop('b31', 9)` function again to drop the block at the center slot (slot 9), but this time at a higher layer to form the top part of the structure.

By following these steps in the appropriate order, we ensure that the blocks are dropped in a stable manner and meet the boundary intrusion constraint. The resulting structure will resemble the character "U" and satisfy all the given constraints.
