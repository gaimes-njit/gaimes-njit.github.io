To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "X" and meets all the constraints, we can use the ab_drop() function iteratively to drop the blocks in a specific order and position.

Here is an example implementation:

```
# Define the order and positions to drop the blocks
block_order = ['b11', 'b31', 'b11', 'b13', 'b11', 'b31']
block_positions = [5, 8, 11, 9, 5, 8]

# Iterate over the blocks and their positions
for block_type, x_position in zip(block_order, block_positions):
    # Drop the block at the specified position
    ab_drop(block_type, x_position)
```

In this example, the blocks are dropped in the order specified in `block_order` list, and their corresponding positions are specified in the `block_positions` list.

The specific order and positions can be determined using techniques in the block-stacking problem to ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion. By carefully selecting the order and positions of the blocks, we can create a stable structure that resembles the character "X" while satisfying all the constraints.
