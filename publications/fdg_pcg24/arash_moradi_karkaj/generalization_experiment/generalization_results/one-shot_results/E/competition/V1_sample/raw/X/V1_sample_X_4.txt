To generate a stable structure that looks like the "X", we can create the following sequence of commands using the ab drop() function:

1. Drop a b31 block at layer 15, slot 4 (centered). This block will represent the diagonal part of the "X".

2. Drop a b13 block at layer 12, slot 1 (centered). This block will represent the bottom vertical part of the "X".

3. Drop a b13 block at layer 9, slot 7 (centered). This block will represent the top vertical part of the "X".

4. Drop a b31 block at layer 6, slot 10 (centered). This block will represent the other diagonal part of the "X".

By following these steps and adjusting the positions and block types as needed, we can create a stable structure that resembles the "X" shape.
