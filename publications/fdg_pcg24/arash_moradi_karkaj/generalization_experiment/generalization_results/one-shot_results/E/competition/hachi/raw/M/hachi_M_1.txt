Example Output:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

Explanation:

In this example, we drop the blocks in a specific order and position to create stable structures resembling the letter "M". 

1. `ab_drop('b31', 8)`: We start by dropping a horizontal block (`b31`) at position 8, which forms the top of the "M".

|                       |
|                       |

2. `ab_drop('b13', 7)`: We then drop a vertical block (`b13`) at position 7, which forms the left side of the "M".

```

|         b13           |
|                       |

```

3. `ab_drop('b13', 9)`: Next, we drop another vertical block (`b13`) at position 9, which forms the right side of the "M".

```

|         b31           |
|         b13           |
|                       |

```

4. `ab_drop('b11', 6)`: We then drop a square block (`b11`) at position 6, which fills the gap between the left side and the top of the "M".

```

|                       |
|                       |
|         b11           |
|         b13           |
|         b31           |
|         b13           |
_________________________
```

5. `ab_drop('b11', 10)`: Finally, we drop another square block (`b11`) at position 10, which fills the gap between the right side and the top of the "M".

```

|                       |
|         b11           |
|         b11           |
|         b13           |
|         b31           |
|         b13           |

The resulting structure perfectly represents the capital letter "M" while adhering to the stability constraint and minimizing boundary intrusion.
