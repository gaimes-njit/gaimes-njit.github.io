To create a stable structure resembling "H" while satisfying the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the map using the provided code.
2. Modify the `ab_drop()` function to accommodate the usage of block types `b31` and `b13`.
3. Start building the base of the "H" structure by dropping a `b31` block centered at slot 9.
4. Build the vertical sections of the "H" structure using `b13` blocks. Drop the first block centered at slot 9 on the second layer.
5. Drop additional `b13` blocks at slots 7 and 11 on the third and fourth layers, respectively.
6. Build the crossbar of the "H" structure using `b31` blocks. Drop the first block centered at slot 9 on the fifth layer.
7. Drop additional `b31` blocks at slots 7 and 11 on the sixth and seventh layers, respectively.
8. Build the top sections of the "H" structure by adding `b13` blocks. Drop the first block centered at slot 9 on the eighth layer.
9. Drop additional `b13` blocks at slots 7 and 11 on the ninth and tenth layers, respectively.
10. Continue building the structure by adding one more `b13` block at the center of the eleventh layer, slot 9.
11. Finally, add a `b31` block centered at slot 9 on the twelfth layer to complete the "H" structure.

The resulting code block with the `ab_drop()` inputs would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
