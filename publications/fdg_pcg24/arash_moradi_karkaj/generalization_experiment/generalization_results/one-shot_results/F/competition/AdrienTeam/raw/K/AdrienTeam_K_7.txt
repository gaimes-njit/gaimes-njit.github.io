Here is the solution to create a structure resembling "K" while satisfying all the given constraints:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 1: Drop the left vertical block of the "K"
ab_drop('b13', 8)

# Step 2: Drop the horizontal block of the "K"
ab_drop('b31', 7)

# Step 3: Drop the right vertical block of the "K"
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

This solution builds the structure of "K" from the bottom layer to the top layer, ensuring that the blocks do not extend beyond the map boundaries and the y-coordinate corresponds to the block's center. The blocks are positioned in a way that results in a realistic and proportional shape for the "K".
