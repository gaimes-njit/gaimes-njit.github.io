The constraints for constructing the "P" shape while adhering to the given rules are as follows:

1. Start building from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15).
2. Rotate the 'L' character if necessary to achieve the desired shape.
3. Place the blocks in the correct order and position for a stable structure.
4. Avoid extending beyond the map boundaries (no boundary intrusion).
5. The y-coordinate should correspond to the block's center.
6. Avoid using `ab_drop('b31',0)`, as it is prohibited.

Here is the code that generates the structure:

```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Place the first block (b13) at the bottom left corner
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Place the second block (b11) on top of the first block
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Place the third block (b11) on top of the second block
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Place the fourth block (b13) on top of the third block
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Place the fifth block (b31) on top of the fourth block
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Place the sixth block (b11) on top of the fifth block
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Place the seventh block (b11) on top of the sixth block
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Place the eighth block (b11) on top of the seventh block
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Place the ninth block (b11) on top of the eighth block
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Place the tenth block (b13) on top of the ninth block
ab_drop('b13', 3)

# Place the eleventh block (b31) on top of the tenth block
ab_drop('b31', 4)

# Place the twelfth block (b11) on top of the eleventh block
ab_drop('b11', 4)

# Place the thirteenth block (b11) on top of the twelfth block
ab_drop('b11', 4)

# Place the fourteenth block (b13) on top of the thirteenth block
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Place the fifteenth block (b11) on top of the fourteenth block
ab_drop('b11', 5)

# Place the sixteenth block (b11) on top of the fifteenth block
ab_drop('b11', 5)

# Place the seventeenth block (b13) on top of the sixteenth block
ab_drop('b13', 6)

# Place the eighteenth block (b11) on top of the seventeenth block
ab_drop('b11', 6)

# Place the nineteenth block (b11) on top of the eighteenth block
ab_drop('b11', 6)

# Place the twentieth block (b11) on top of the nineteenth block
ab_drop('b11', 6)

# Place the 21st block (b13) on top of the twentieth block
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Place the 22nd block (b31) on top of the 21st block
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Place the 23rd block (b11) on top of the 22nd block
ab_drop('b11', 8)

# Place the 24th block (b11) on top of the 23rd block
ab_drop('b11', 8)

# Place the 25th block (b11) on top of the 24th block
ab_drop('b11', 8)

# Place the 26th block (b13) on top of the 25th block
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Place the 27th block (b11) on top of the 26th block
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Place the 28th block (b11) on top of the 27th block
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Place the 29th block (b31) on top of the 28th block
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Place the 30th block (b11) on top of the 29th block
ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Place the 31st block (b11) on top of the 30th block
ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Place the 32nd block (b11) on top of the 31st block
ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Place the 33rd block (b13) on top of the 32nd block
ab_drop('b13', 11)

# Place the 34th block (b31) on top of the 33rd block
ab_drop('b31', 12)

# Place the 35th block (b11) on top of the 34th block
ab_drop('b11', 12)

# Place the 36th block (b11) on top of the 35th block
ab_drop('b11', 12)

# Place the 37th block (b11) on top of the 36th block
ab_drop('b11', 12)

# Place the 38th block (b13) on top of the 37th block
ab_drop('b13', 13)

# Place the 39th block (b31) on top of the 38th block
ab_drop('b31', 14)

# Place the 40th block (b11) on top of the 39th block
ab_drop('b11', 14)

# Place the 41st block (b11) on top of the 40th block
ab_drop('b11', 14)

# Place the 42nd block (b13) on top of the 41st block
ab_drop('b13', 15)

# Place the 43rd block (b11) on top of the 42nd block
ab_drop('b11', 15)

# Place the 44th block (b11) on top of the 43rd block
ab_drop('b11', 15)
```

This code will generate the structure that resembles the letter "P" by placing the blocks in a stable and continuous manner while adhering to the given constraints.
