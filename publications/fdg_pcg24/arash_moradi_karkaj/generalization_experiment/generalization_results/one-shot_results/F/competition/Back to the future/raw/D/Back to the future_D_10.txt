To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure:
   - Create an empty grid of size WxH using the provided code snippet:
     ```
     structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
     ```

2. Drop the base block (b31):
   - To ensure stability, we need to drop the base block in the center slots of the bottom layer (layer 0).
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', (W-1)//2)
     ```

3. Drop the vertical blocks (b13):
   - To create the curved shape of the "D", we need to drop two vertical blocks on the left side of the structure, one above the other. The first block will be dropped on the second layer (layer 1), and the second block will be dropped on the fourth layer (layer 3). Each block's center slot should align with the base block's center slot.
     ```
     ab_drop('b13', (W-1)//2)
     ab_drop('b13', (W-1)//2)
     ```

4. Drop the top block (b31):
   - To complete the "D" shape, we need to drop a top block on top of the vertical blocks. The top block's center slot should align with the base block's center slot.
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', (W-1)//2)
     ```

With these steps, we have generated a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D" and meets all the hard constraints.
