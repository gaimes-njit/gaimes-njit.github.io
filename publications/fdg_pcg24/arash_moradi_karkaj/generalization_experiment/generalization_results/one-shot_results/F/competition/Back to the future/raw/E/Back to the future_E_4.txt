To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "E" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the first b13 block to form the vertical part of the "E".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
This will drop a b13 block with its center aligned with slot 9, and it will land on the base.

Step 3: Drop the second b13 block to form the horizontal top part of the "E".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
This will drop another b13 block with its center aligned with slot 9, and it will land on top of the first b13 block.

Step 4: Drop the b31 block to form the horizontal middle part of the "E".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will drop a b31 block with its center aligned with slot 9, and it will land on top of the second b13 block.

Step 5: Drop the third b13 block to form the horizontal bottom part of the "E".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
This will drop another b13 block with its center aligned with slot 9, and it will land on top of the b31 block.

Step 6: Complete the vertical part of the "E" by dropping two b11 blocks.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```
This will drop two b11 blocks with their centers aligned with slots 7 and 11, respectively. They will land on top of the bottom b13 block.

Step 7: Complete the top part of the "E" by dropping two b11 blocks.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```
This will drop two b11 blocks with their centers aligned with slots 7 and 11, respectively. They will land on top of the top b13 block.

Step 8: Complete the middle part of the "E" by dropping two b11 blocks.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```
This will drop two b11 blocks with their centers aligned with slots 7 and 11, respectively. They will land on top of the b31 block.

The final structure will resemble the uppercase character "E" and satisfy all the hard constraints.
