To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "J" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
2. Drop a b13 block in the center slot of the bottom layer (layer 0) using the `ab_drop()` function.
3. Drop a b13 block on top of the previous block, shifted one slot to the right. This will create the vertical part of the "J" shape.
4. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous two blocks. This will create the horizontal part of the "J" shape.
5. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous three blocks. This will complete the "J" shape.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 to create additional structures that meet the constraints and create diverse content.

Here is the code to generate the "J" shape using the `ab_drop()` function:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    return drop_pos

# Generate the "J" shape
drop_pos = ab_drop('b13', W//2)
drop_pos = ab_drop('b13', drop_pos[1]+1)
drop_pos = ab_drop('b31', drop_pos[1])
drop_pos = ab_drop('b11', drop_pos[1])

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This code will generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "J" and meets all the hard constraints. The `ab_drop()` function is used to drop blocks in the appropriate positions, ensuring stability and following the desired shape. Each successful drop is recorded in the `drop_pos` variable, allowing for precise positioning of subsequent blocks.
