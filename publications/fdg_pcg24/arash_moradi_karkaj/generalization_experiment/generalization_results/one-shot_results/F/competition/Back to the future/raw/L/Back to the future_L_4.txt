To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "L" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Define a function to check the stability of the structure after dropping a block:
   
   def check_stability(drop_pos):
       # Check if the block is supported by any previously dropped blocks or the base
       if drop_pos[0] == H-1 or structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
           return True
       return False

3. Define a function to drop a block at a given position:
   
   def ab_drop(x, y):
       drop_pos = (H-1, y)  # Initialize the drop position at the top of the map
       
       while drop_pos[0] > 0:
           drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)  # Move the block down
           if check_stability(drop_pos):
               break
       
       structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x  # Place the block on the structure

4. Use the ab_drop() function to generate the structure in the shape of the uppercase character "L" by dropping the blocks one by one according to the block-stacking problem:

   # Drop the b31 block on the first layer
   ab_drop('b31', 10)

   # Drop the b13 block on the second layer
   ab_drop('b13', 10)

   # Drop the b11 block on the third layer
   ab_drop('b11', 10)

   # Drop the b11 block on the fourth layer
   ab_drop('b11', 10)

   # Drop the b11 block on the fifth layer
   ab_drop('b11', 9)

   # Drop the b11 block on the sixth layer
   ab_drop('b11', 8)

   # Drop the b11 block on the seventh layer
   ab_drop('b11', 7)

   # Drop the b11 block on the eighth layer
   ab_drop('b11', 6)

   # Drop the b11 block on the ninth layer
   ab_drop('b11', 5)

   # Drop the b11 block on the tenth layer
   ab_drop('b11', 4)

   # Drop the b11 block on the eleventh layer
   ab_drop('b11', 3)

   # Drop the b11 block on the twelfth layer
   ab_drop('b11', 2)

   # Drop the b11 block on the thirteenth layer
   ab_drop('b11', 1)

   # Drop the b11 block on the fourteenth layer
   ab_drop('b11', 1)

   # Drop the b31 block on the fifteenth layer
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

Each call to ab_drop() function drops a specific block at the desired position on the structure, and the stability check is performed before each drop to ensure the structure remains stable.

After executing these steps, the structure will resemble the uppercase character "L" and meet all the hard constraints.
