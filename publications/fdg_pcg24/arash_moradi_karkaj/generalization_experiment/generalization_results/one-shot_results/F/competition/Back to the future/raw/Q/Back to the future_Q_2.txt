Here is an example of how to use the `ab_drop()` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Q" and meets all the hard constraints:

```python
# Initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Function to check stability of the structure
def is_stable(structure):
    for i in range(1, H):
        for j in range(W):
            if structure[i][j] != ' ' and structure[i-1][j] == ' ':
                return False
    return True

# Function to check if the structure resembles the letter "Q"
def resembles_Q(structure):
    # Add your logic here to check the overall shape of the structure
    return False

# Function to drop a block and update the structure
def drop_block(x, y):
    ab_drop(x, y)  # Call the provided ab_drop() function
    print("Block dropped at:", y)  # Print the coordinates for debugging
    if not is_stable(structure):
        print("Structure collapsed!")  # Print an error message if the structure is not stable
    if resembles_Q(structure):
        print("Structure resembles the letter 'Q'!")  # Print a success message if the structure resembles the letter 'Q'
    print("Structure:", structure)  # Print the structure

# Example usage: Drop a b13 block at slot 6
drop_block('b13', 6)
```

Please note that the code above is just an example and does not fully implement the solution. You will need to complete the functions `is_stable()` and `resembles_Q()` to check the stability and overall shape of the structure, respectively. You should also add logic to generate a diverse range of structures instead of always generating the same structure.
