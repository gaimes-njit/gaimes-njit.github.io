To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "R" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first b31 block at the center slot of the base layer to form the vertical stem of the "R". This block will serve as the stable support for the rest of the structure.
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Drop two b11 blocks above the stem to form the top part of the "R". These blocks will connect to the stem at the middle slot.
```
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

4. Drop a b13 block to the right of the stem and slightly above it. This will form the horizontal leg of the "R". The block should be dropped at the slot directly next to the stem's right side to ensure stability.
```
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

5. Drop a b11 block on top of the b13 block to complete the horizontal leg of the "R".
```
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

6. Ensure stability after each drop to prevent collapse or descent of the structure. Verify that the structure remains stable using a stability check function.

7. Perform the stability check for each drop so far and make any necessary adjustments to ensure stability. If the check fails, additional support blocks may need to be placed to stabilize the structure.

8. Continue dropping blocks, following the same pattern as step 5, to create additional horizontal legs and vertical stems as desired to make the structure resemble the uppercase "R". Ensure stability after each drop and perform the stability check.

9. Make sure to adhere to the soft constraint of not intruding on the boundary of the map. Adjust the drop positions if necessary to avoid boundary intrusion.

10. Aim for diversity in the generated content by considering different placements and block combinations while still meeting the stability and similarity constraints.

By following these steps and using the provided `ab_drop()` function, you can generate a stable structure resembling the uppercase character "R" that meets all the hard constraints. Remember to conduct stability checks after each drop to ensure the overall stability of the structure.
