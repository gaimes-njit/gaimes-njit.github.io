To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "U" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid of size WxH using the provided code snippet.

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) by placing a b31 block at the center slot.

```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

3. To ensure stability, check if the block is supported by the lower layers. If not, place supporting blocks beneath it.

```python
if structure[1][W//2] == ' ':
    ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

4. Proceed to build the vertical part of the "U" by placing a b13 block above the b31 block.

```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

5. To ensure stability, check if the b13 block is supported by the lower layers. If not, place supporting blocks beneath it.

```python
if (structure[2][W//2] == ' ' or
    structure[3][W//2] == ' ' or
    structure[4][W//2] == ' '):
    
    ab_drop('b11', W//2)
```

6. Repeat steps 3-5 to build the other vertical part of the "U" symmetrically.

```python
# Place the second b13 block
ab_drop('b13', W//2-2)

# Check stability and place supporting blocks if necessary
if (structure[2][W//2-2] == ' ' or
    structure[3][W//2-2] == ' ' or
    structure[4][W//2-2] == ' '):
    
    ab_drop('b11', W//2-2)

# Place the third b13 block
ab_drop('b13', W//2+2)

# Check stability and place supporting blocks if necessary
if (structure[2][W//2+2] == ' ' or
    structure[3][W//2+2] == ' ' or
    structure[4][W//2+2] == ' '):
    
    ab_drop('b11', W//2+2)
```

7. The main structure of the "U" has been built. Now, we can add details or variations to the structure to make it more diverse.

8. Finally, ensure that the entire structure is stable by performing stability checks before each call to ab_drop. This can be done by checking the support condition for each block being dropped.

For example, to drop a b31 block at layer 3 with its center aligned at slot 5, the stability check should be done by checking if structure[2][5] has a supporting block.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)

# Stability check
if structure[2][5] == ' ':
    ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

Note: The exact implementation may vary depending on the programming language or platform being used. The provided code snippets are written in Python and assume the availability of the ab_drop function.
