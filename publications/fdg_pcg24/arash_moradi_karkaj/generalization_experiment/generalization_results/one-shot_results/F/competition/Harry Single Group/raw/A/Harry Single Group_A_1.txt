```

The code above initializes the field as an empty grid of 16 rows and 20 columns. The `print_field()` function is used to display the current state of the field.

The `is_stable()` function checks the stability of a brick by comparing the number of empty cells on the left and right sides of the pivot. This is used to ensure stability when stacking bricks.

The `place_brick()` function is used to place a specific brick on the field at the specified x-coordinate. It uses a while loop to find the appropriate y-coordinate where the brick can be placed, based on the conditions mentioned in the problem definition.

The `ab_drop()` function is called to place the bricks one by one to form the letter "A". The coordinates and brick types are chosen based on the desired shape of the letter "A".

Finally, the `print_field()` function is called to display the final field with the letter "A" formed by the bricks.
