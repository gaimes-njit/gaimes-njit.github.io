First, we need to initialize the field by creating an empty 2D list with dimensions 16x20. Each cell will be represented by a '0' indicating it is unoccupied.

``` python
field = [['0' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to place the bricks on the field in a way that forms the shape resembling the letter "J".

``` python
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Place the horizontal brick at x_position 6
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the vertical brick at x_position 5
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place the square brick at x_position 6
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Place another square brick at x_position 7
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Place another square brick at x_position 8
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Place another square brick at x_position 9
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Place the vertical brick at x_position 10
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place the horizontal brick at x_position 10
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place the horizontal brick at x_position 9
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will place the bricks on the field to form the shape resembling the letter "J". The resulting occupied cells will be:

```
(5, 0)
(5, 1)
(5, 2)
(5, 3)
(6, 3)
(7, 3)
(6, 4)
(7, 4)
(8, 4)
(9, 4)
(10, 2)
(10, 3)
(10, 4)
(11, 2)
(12, 2)
(13, 2)
```

Please note that without further adjustments, the code provided above assumes that the `ab_drop()` function appropriately checks for stability and avoids boundary collisions as stated in the important notes. The specific implementation of the `ab_drop()` function is not provided, so it is assumed to follow these requirements.
