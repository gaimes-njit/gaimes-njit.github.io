To form the shape resembling the letter "L" using the available bricks, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the field map as a 2D array of size 20x16, representing the 320 cells of the field. Set all cells to be initially empty.

2. Place the b11 brick at the top right corner of the field, at position (18, 15). This will ensure that the structure does not exceed the boundaries of the field.

3. Drop the b31 brick at position (18, 12) using the ab_drop('b31', 18) function. This will occupy cells (16, 12), (17, 12), and (18, 12).

4. Drop the b13 brick at position (14, 9) using the ab_drop('b13', 14) function. This will occupy cells (14, 9), (14, 8), and (14, 7).

5. Drop the b31 brick at position (9, 5) using the ab_drop('b31', 9) function. This will occupy cells (9, 5), (10, 5), and (11, 5).

6. Drop the b13 brick at position (6, 5) using the ab_drop('b13', 6) function. This will occupy cells (6, 5), (6, 4), and (6, 3).

7. Drop the b31 brick at position (1, 1) using the ab_drop('b31', 1) function. This will occupy cells (1, 1), (2, 1), and (3, 1).

By following these steps, we will successfully form the shape resembling the letter "L" using the given bricks and satisfying the stability and boundary collision rules.
