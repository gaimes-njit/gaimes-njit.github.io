First, let's initialize the map as an empty field with a width of 20 and a height of 16:

```
map = [[0]*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

To form the shape resembling the letter "W", we need to place the bricks in a specific pattern. We will use the ab_drop() function to drop each brick and update the map accordingly. We'll start from the bottom of the field and work our way up.

1. Drop a b31 brick at (9, 0):
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will occupy cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).

2. Drop a b11 brick at (10, 1):
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
This will occupy cell (10, 1).

3. Drop a b31 brick at (11, 1):
```
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```
This will occupy cells (10, 1), (11, 1), and (12, 1).

4. Drop a b11 brick at (12, 2):
```
ab_drop('b11', 12)
```
This will occupy cell (12, 2).

5. Drop a b13 brick at (13, 2):
```
ab_drop('b13', 13)
```
This will occupy cells (13, 2), (13, 1), and (13, 0).

6. Drop a b11 brick at (13, 3):
```
ab_drop('b11', 13)
```
This will occupy cell (13, 3).

7. Drop a b13 brick at (14, 3):
```
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```
This will occupy cells (14, 3), (14, 2), and (14, 1).

8. Drop a b31 brick at (15, 2):
```
ab_drop('b31', 15)
```
This will occupy cells (14, 2), (15, 2), and (16, 2).

9. Drop a b31 brick at (16, 1):
```
ab_drop('b31', 16)
```
This will occupy cells (15, 1), (16, 1), and (17, 1).

10. Drop a b11 brick at (17, 0):
```
ab_drop('b11', 17)
```
This will occupy cell (17, 0).

11. Drop a b13 brick at (18, 0):
```
ab_drop('b13', 18)
```
This will occupy cells (18, 0), (18, 1), and (18, 2).

12. Drop a b11 brick at (18, 3):
```
ab_drop('b11', 18)
```
This will occupy cell (18, 3).

After performing these steps, the map will represent the shape resembling the letter "W".
