To create a "V" shape inside a 20x16 box using the `ab_drop()` command, we need to strategically position and drop different block types at specific x positions. Here is the sequence of commands needed:

1. Drop a 1x3 block (b13) at x position 8.
2. Drop a 1x1 block (b11) at x position 7.
3. Drop a 1x1 block (b11) at x position 9.
4. Drop a 1x1 block (b11) at x position 6.
5. Drop a 1x1 block (b11) at x position 10.
6. Drop a 3x1 block (b31) at x position 5.
7. Drop a 3x1 block (b31) at x position 11.
8. Drop a 1x1 block (b11) at x position 4.
9. Drop a 1x1 block (b11) at x position 12.

The resulting structure will resemble a "V" shape inside the 20x16 box.
