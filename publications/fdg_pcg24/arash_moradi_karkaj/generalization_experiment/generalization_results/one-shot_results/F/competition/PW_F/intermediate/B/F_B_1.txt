To generate the uppercase letter "B", we will need to use a combination of the block types b13 and b31. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "B":

ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 6)

Please ensure that these commands are executed consecutively and in the correct order to accurately generate the letter "B" within the defined environment.
