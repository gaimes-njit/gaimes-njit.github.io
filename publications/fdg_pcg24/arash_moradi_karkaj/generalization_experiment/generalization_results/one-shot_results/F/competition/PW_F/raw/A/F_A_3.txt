To generate the uppercase English letter "A", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2.
3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3.
4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2.
5. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3.
6. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2.
7. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3.

This sequence of commands will create the letter "A" in the Tetris-like environment.
