To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter "A" within the given boundaries of the grid.
