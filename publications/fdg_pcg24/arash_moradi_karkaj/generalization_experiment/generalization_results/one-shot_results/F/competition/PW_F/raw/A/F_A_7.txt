To construct the letter "A" using the provided block types, we can follow the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place three vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 1, 2, and 3 to create the left slant of the letter "A".
- Then, we place four horizontal straight blocks ('b31') at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 to create the middle part of the letter "A".
- Finally, we place two vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 3 and 4 to complete the right slant of the letter "A".

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase English letter "A" within the allowed space boundaries and ensuring structural stability according to the gravity rules.
