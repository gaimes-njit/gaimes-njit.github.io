To generate the uppercase letter "A", you can follow the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

These commands will create a letter "A" using the given block types and within the defined boundaries of the grid. Each command places one block at a time, gradually constructing the desired shape.
