To generate the uppercase English letter "A" using the given block types and environment, the following stream of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. The first two commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)` and `ab_drop('b13', 2)` are used to create the vertical sides of the letter "A".
2. The third command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` is used to create the horizontal crossbar of the letter "A".
3. The next two commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)` and `ab_drop('b13', 2)` are used to reinforce the vertical sides of the letter "A".
4. The final command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` is used to reinforce the horizontal crossbar of the letter "A".

By executing these commands consecutively, the letter "A" will be generated in the Tetris-like environment.
