ab_drop('b13', 1)       # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)       # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)       # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)       # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 1)       # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)       # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)       # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
