To generate the uppercase letter "B" using the block types and gravity rules mentioned, you will need to follow the instructions below:

1. Stack two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the grid:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Stack a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the vertical blocks, starting from the second position:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

By following the above instructions and executing the corresponding ab_drop() commands, you will be able to generate the uppercase letter "B" within the given environment and with structural stability.
