To generate the capital English letter "B", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 to form the left side of the letter "B".
- Then, we place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2 to complete the left side.
- Next, we place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 to form the top part of the letter "B".
- After that, we repeat the process of placing vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 1, 2, and 3 to create the right side of the letter "B".

By following these commands, we can generate the uppercase English letter "B" within the defined environment.
