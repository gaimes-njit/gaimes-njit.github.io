To generate the uppercase English letter "B", we can follow the steps below:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at positions 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create the second layer:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These steps will result in the letter "B" being generated in the Tetris-like environment.
