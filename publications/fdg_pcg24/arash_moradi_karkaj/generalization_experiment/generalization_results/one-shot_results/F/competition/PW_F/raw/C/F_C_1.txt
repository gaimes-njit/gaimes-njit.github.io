To create the uppercase letter "C" using the given block types in the defined environment, we can follow these steps:

1. First, place a vertical straight block of type b13 at position 1:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

2. Next, place another vertical straight block of type b13 at position 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. Now, place a horizontal straight block of type b31 at position 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

4. Repeat steps 1-3:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

5. Finally, repeat steps 1-3 once more:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

These commands will create the uppercase letter "C" in the defined environment, adhering to the stacking and stability rules.
