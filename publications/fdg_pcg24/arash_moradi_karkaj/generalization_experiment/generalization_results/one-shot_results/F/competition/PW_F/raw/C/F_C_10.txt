To generate the uppercase English letter "C," you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
3. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 2.
4. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 3.
5. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
6. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 3.
7. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
8. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 2.
9. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 3.
10. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 3.

These commands will create the letter "C" within the defined environment, adhering to the gravity rules.
