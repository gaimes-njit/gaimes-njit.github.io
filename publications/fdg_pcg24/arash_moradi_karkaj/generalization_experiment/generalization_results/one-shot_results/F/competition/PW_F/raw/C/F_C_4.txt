To create the uppercase English letter "C", you can use the following sequence of commands using the ab_drop() function:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1.
- The next four commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places vertical straight blocks of height 3 at position 1, creating the vertical line of the letter "C".
- Finally, the last command `ab_drop('b31', 4)` places another horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 4, completing the letter "C".

Make sure to follow the order and positions specified in the commands to accurately represent the uppercase English letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries.
