To generate the uppercase letter "C", you would follow the steps below:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
```ab_drop('b13', 1)```

2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, two spaces below the first block:
```ab_drop('b13', 3)```

3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, aligned with the top of the vertical blocks:
```ab_drop('b31', 2)```

4. Repeat steps 1 and 2:
```ab_drop('b13', 1)```
```ab_drop('b13', 3)```

5. Finally, repeat step 3:
```ab_drop('b31', 2)```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "C" in the Tetris-like environment.
