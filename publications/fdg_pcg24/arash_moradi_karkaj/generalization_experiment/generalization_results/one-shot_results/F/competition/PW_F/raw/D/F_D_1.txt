To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we can use a combination of block types to construct the desired shape. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "D":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Place a third vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  // Place a third horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)  // Place a vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 6)  // Place a third vertical straight block at position 6
```

These commands will create the uppercase letter "D" in the Tetris-like environment, while ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
