To generate the letter "D", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This will create a capital "D" shape within the allowed space boundaries. Note that we start constructing the shapes from the X position 1 and follow the gravity rules to ensure stability.
