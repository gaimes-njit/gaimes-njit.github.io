To generate the uppercase letter "D", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 9
ab_drop('b13', 13)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 13
ab_drop('b13', 14)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 14
ab_drop('b13', 15)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 15
ab_drop('b13', 16)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 16
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "D" in the defined space.
