To generate the uppercase letter "D", we can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) side by side at position 1 and 2 along the width.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 2 along the width.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.
4. Finally, place a horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 2 along the width.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "D":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Make sure to execute these commands consecutively from the first line to the last line to construct the letter "D" accurately and ensure structural stability with the gravity rules.
