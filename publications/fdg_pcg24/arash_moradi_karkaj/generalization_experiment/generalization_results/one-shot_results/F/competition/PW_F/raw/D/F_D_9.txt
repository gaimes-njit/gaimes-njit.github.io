To generate the uppercase letter "D", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b13', 13)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
ab_drop('b13', 15)
```

Explanation:
- Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1.
- Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 3.
- Place another vertical straight block of height 3 at position 10.
- Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 11.
- Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 12.
- Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 13.
- Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 14.
- Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 15.

These commands will construct the letter "D" in the Tetris-like environment while ensuring stability and fitting within the boundaries.
