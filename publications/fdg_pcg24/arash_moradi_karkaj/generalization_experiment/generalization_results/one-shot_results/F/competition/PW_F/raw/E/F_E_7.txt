To generate the uppercase English letter "E", we can use the following sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place vertical block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "E" by stacking the blocks in the defined environment while adhering to the gravity rules.
