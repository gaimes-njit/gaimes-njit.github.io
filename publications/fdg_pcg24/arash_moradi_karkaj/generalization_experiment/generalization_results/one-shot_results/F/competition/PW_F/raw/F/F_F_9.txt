To generate the uppercase English letter "F" using the block types and the given environment, you can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Repeat the first two steps
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

By executing the above set of commands, you will construct the letter "F" in the Tetris-like environment while ensuring stacking and stability.
