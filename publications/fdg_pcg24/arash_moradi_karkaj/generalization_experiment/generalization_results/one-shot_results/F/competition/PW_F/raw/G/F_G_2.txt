To create the uppercase letter "G" using the given block types and environment, you can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the third vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the fourth vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the fifth vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 8
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 11
ab_drop('b31', 14)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 14
ab_drop('b31', 17)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 17
ab_drop('b31', 19)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 19
ab_drop('b13', 19)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 19
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "G" within the allowed space and with structural stability according to the gravity rules.
