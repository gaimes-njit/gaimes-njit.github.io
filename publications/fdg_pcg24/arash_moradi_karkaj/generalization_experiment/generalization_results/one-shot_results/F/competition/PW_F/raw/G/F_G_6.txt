To generate the uppercase letter 'G' using the given block types and gravity rules, follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
``` 
ab_drop('b13', 1) 
```

2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) next to the previous block at position 2:
``` 
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks at position 2:
``` 
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Repeat steps 1-3 to create the bottom part of the 'G':
``` 
ab_drop('b13', 1) 
ab_drop('b13', 2) 
ab_drop('b31', 2) 
```

5. Finally, place a horizontal straight block (b31) above the bottom part of the 'G' at position 2 to complete the letter:
``` 
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

When all the commands are executed consecutively, they will create a stack of blocks that resemble the uppercase letter 'G'.
