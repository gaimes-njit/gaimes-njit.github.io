To generate the uppercase letter "H", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by dropping three b13 blocks vertically in positions 1, 2, and 3 to form the left vertical line of the "H".
2. Then, we drop a b31 block horizontally in position 2 to form the middle horizontal line of the "H".
3. Finally, we repeat the process of dropping three b13 blocks vertically in positions 1, 2, and 3 to form the right vertical line of the "H".

By following these commands, the blocks will stack on top of each other and form the uppercase letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries of the grid.
