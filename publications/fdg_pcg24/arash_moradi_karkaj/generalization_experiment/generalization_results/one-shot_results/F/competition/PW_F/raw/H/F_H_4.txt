To generate the letter "H", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These commands will construct the letter "H" in the Tetris-like environment, ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
