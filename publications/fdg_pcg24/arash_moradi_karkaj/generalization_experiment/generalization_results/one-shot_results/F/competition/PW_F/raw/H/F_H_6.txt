To generate the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the third horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the fourth horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the fifth horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the sixth horizontal block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable "H" shape within the allowed space boundaries.
