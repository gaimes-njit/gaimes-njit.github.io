To generate the uppercase letter "I", use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
```

These commands will generate the uppercase letter "I" in the defined environment, following the gravity rules and ensuring structural stability.
