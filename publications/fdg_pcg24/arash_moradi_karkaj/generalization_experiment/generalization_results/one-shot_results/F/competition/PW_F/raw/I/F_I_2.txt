To generate the uppercase English letter "I" using the ab_drop() command and the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

The stream of commands to generate the letter "I" would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Remember to execute these commands consecutively without exceeding the height boundary of 16 units.
