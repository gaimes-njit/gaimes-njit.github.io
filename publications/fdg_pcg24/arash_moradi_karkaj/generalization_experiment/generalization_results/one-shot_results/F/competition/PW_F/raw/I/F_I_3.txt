To generate the uppercase English letter "I" using the given block types and environment, you can follow the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

These commands will construct the letter "I" by stacking the block types as required and ensuring structural stability within the defined gravity rules.
