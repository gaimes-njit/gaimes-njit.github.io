To generate the uppercase letter "I" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

These steps will create the uppercase letter "I" within the allowed space boundaries. Remember to include the stream of commands consecutively between three backticks.
