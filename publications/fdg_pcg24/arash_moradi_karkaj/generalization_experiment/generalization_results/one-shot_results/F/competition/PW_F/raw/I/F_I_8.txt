To generate the uppercase letter "I" using the provided block types and environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will place ten vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other, forming the letter "I" within the boundaries of the allowed space.
