To generate the uppercase English letter "J" in the given environment, you need to use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)            # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)            # Place another vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)            # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)            # Place a horizontal straight block starting from position 3
```

These commands will create the shape of the letter "J" within the allowed space and maintain its stability according to the gravity rules.

Remember to include the commands consecutively within the three backticks (```) as mentioned in the prompt.
