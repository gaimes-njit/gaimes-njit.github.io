To generate the uppercase letter "J", we can use the following sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  // Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  // Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',2)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',2)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will form the letter "J" within the allowed space boundaries while adhering to the gravity rules.
