To generate the letter "K" using the given block types, we need to follow the structural pattern of the letter. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "K":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Repeat the first block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Repeat the second block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Repeat the horizontal straight block at position 2
```

By following these commands, the letter "K" will be generated in the Tetris-like environment.
