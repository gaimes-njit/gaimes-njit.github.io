K: To generate the uppercase letter "K", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal block connecting the second and third vertical blocks
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the fourth vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the fifth vertical block at position 3
```

By following these commands in sequence, you will construct the uppercase letter "K" within the allowed space boundaries and according to the gravity rules.
