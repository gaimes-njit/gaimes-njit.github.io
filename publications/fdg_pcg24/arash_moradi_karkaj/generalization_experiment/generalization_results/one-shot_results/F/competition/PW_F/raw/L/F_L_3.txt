To generate the uppercase letter "L", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

Explanation:
- First, you place a vertical straight block ('b13') in position 1.
- Then, you place another vertical straight block ('b13') in position 2.
- Next, you place a third vertical straight block ('b13') in position 3.
- Finally, you place a horizontal straight block ('b31') in position 2 to complete the shape of the letter "L".
