To generate the uppercase letter "L", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places a vertical straight block at the first position along the width.
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block next to the first one.
3. The third command `ab_drop('b13', 3)` places a third vertical straight block next to the second one.
4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 3)` places a horizontal straight block on top of the third vertical straight block, completing the letter "L".

Please note that these commands assume that the grid has been cleared before starting the construction of the letter "L".
