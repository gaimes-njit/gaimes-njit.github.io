To construct the uppercase letter "M" in the grid, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

These commands will place the blocks in a way that resembles the letter "M". The first two commands create the left side of the letter, the next three commands create the middle part, and the last three commands create the right side of the letter.
