To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Create the left vertical stroke
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Create the left diagonal stroke
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Create the right diagonal stroke
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Create the right vertical stroke
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "M" in the defined environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to gravity rules.
