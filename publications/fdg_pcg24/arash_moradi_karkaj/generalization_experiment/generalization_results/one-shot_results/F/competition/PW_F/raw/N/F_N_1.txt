To create the uppercase letter "N" using the given block types and gravity rules, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) one above the other, starting from position 1:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13',1)
   ab_drop('b13',2)
   ```

2. Next, place a horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31',2)
   ```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create the second half of the letter "N":
   ```
   ab_drop('b13',1)
   ab_drop('b13',2)
   ab_drop('b31',2)
   ```

Make sure to enter the commands consecutively within three backticks (```) as mentioned above.
