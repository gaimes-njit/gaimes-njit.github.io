To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1.
- Then, we place a horizontal straight block ('b31') starting from position 1.
- Next, we place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3 to create the diagonal of the "N".
- After that, we place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 4 to complete the diagonal.
- Finally, we place a horizontal straight block ('b31') starting from position 4 to create the base of the "N".
