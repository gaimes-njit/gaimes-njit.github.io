To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can follow the following steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) in the first and second positions along the width.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) in the second position along the width.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.
4. Finally, place a horizontal straight block (b31) in the second position along the width.

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "N":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

Please note that the letter "N" will be generated starting from the X position 1 within the defined environment.
