To generate the uppercase English letter "P", we can use the following sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical straight block at X position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place vertical straight block at X position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place vertical straight block at X position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal straight block at X position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place square block at X position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place square block at X position 3
```

By following these commands, we can construct the uppercase English letter "P" within the allowed space and ensuring structural stability with the gravity rules.
