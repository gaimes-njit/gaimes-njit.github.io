To generate the uppercase letter "P" using the given command and block types, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first three commands construct the vertical stroke of the letter "P" using the b13 block type.
- The fourth command constructs the horizontal stroke of the letter "P" using the b31 block type.
- The final two commands construct the bottom part of the vertical stroke of the letter "P" using the b13 block type.

The result will be the uppercase letter "P" constructed in the given environment.
