To generate the uppercase English letter "P", we can use the following commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This series of commands will construct the letter "P" within the allowed space boundaries and following the 2D gravity rules.
