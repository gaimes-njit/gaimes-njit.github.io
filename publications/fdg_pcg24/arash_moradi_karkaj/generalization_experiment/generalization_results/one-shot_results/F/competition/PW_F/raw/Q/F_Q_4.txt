To generate the uppercase letter "Q" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) right next to the first one, at position 2.
3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 2 and extending 3 units to the right.
4. Repeat steps 1-3.
5. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 2 and extending 3 units to the right.

The stream of ab_drop() commands for generating the letter "Q" would be as follows:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

Please note that the commands should be executed consecutively, one after the other, to ensure the correct formation of the letter "Q" within the defined environment.
