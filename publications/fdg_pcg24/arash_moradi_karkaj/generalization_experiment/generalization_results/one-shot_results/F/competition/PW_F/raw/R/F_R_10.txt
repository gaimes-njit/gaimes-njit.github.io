To generate the letter "R" using the given block types, you can follow the set of commands below:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first three commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)`, `ab_drop('b13', 2)`, `ab_drop('b13', 3)` create the vertical straight line on the left side of the letter "R".
- The next two commands `ab_drop('b31', 2)`, `ab_drop('b31', 3)` create the horizontal straight line in the middle of the letter "R".
- Finally, the last command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` completes the right side of the letter "R" by adding another vertical straight line.

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively and follow the order given to accurately generate the letter "R" within the specified boundaries.
