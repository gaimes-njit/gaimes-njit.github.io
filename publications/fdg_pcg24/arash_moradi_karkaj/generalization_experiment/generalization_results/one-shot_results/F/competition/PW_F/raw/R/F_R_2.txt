To generate the uppercase English letter "R", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "R" using the three block types mentioned in the instructions while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
