To create the uppercase English letter "R", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block in the first position
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block in the second position
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal straight block in the second position
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block in the second position again
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical straight block in the third position
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal straight block in the third position
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "R" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
