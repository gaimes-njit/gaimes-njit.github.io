To generate the uppercase English letter "R", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal block at position 2
```

These commands will construct the letter "R" within the allowed space in the Tetris-like environment, while maintaining structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
