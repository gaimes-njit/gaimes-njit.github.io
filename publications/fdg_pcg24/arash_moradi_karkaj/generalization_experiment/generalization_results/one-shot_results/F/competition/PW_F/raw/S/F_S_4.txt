To generate the uppercase English letter "S" using the given block types, we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

Explanation: 
- We start by placing a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1.
- Then, we place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2, right next to the previous block.
- Next, we place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2, overlapping the previous vertical block.
- We continue by placing another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3, right next to the previous block.
- Then, we place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3, right next to the previous horizontal block.
- Next, we place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 4, right next to the previous block.
- Finally, we repeat the steps to complete the letter "S" by placing a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1, overlapping the previous vertical blocks.

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "S" within the allowed space and following the gravity rules.
