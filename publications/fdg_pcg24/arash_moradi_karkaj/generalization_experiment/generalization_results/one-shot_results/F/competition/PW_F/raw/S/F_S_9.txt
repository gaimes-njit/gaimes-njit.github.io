To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we can use the following stream of commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing three vertical straight blocks (`b13`) in positions 1, 2, and 3.
- Then, we place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) starting from position 2.
- Next, we place three horizontal straight blocks (`b31`) starting from positions 2, 3, and 4.
- Finally, we place three vertical straight blocks (`b13`) starting from positions 2, 3, and 4.

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "S" in the defined environment.
