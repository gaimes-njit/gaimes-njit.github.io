To generate the uppercase English letter "T" using the given block types and command, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
- First, we drop two vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 1 and 2 in order to form the vertical stem of the letter "T".
- Then, we drop a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2 to form the top horizontal part of the letter "T".
- Next, we repeat the first three commands to create the bottom horizontal part of the letter "T".
- Finally, we drop one more vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3 to complete the letter "T".
