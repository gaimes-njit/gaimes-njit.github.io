To generate the uppercase letter "T" in the Tetris-like environment, you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)      # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)      # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)      # Place the horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',3)      # Place the horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',2)      # Place the horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)      # Place the horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)      # Place the horizontal block at position 2
```

By following these commands, you will construct the uppercase letter "T" in the Tetris-like environment, ensuring structural stability according to the gravity rules.
