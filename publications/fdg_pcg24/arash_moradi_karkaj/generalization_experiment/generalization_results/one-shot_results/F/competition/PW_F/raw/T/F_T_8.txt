To generate the letter "T" using the provided block types in the defined environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Here's a breakdown of how the commands create the letter "T":

- The first command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, creating the vertical stem of the "T".
- The second command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, extending the vertical stem of the "T".
- The third command `ab_drop('b13', 3)` places another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3, completing the vertical stem of the "T".
- The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, connecting the top of the vertical stem to create the crossbar of the "T".

By executing these commands consecutively, you will generate the uppercase English letter "T" within the defined boundaries.
