To create the uppercase letter "U" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at positions 1 and 2 along the width.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks at position 2 along the width.
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.

4. Finally, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width.

The complete set of commands to generate the letter "U" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Please note that these commands should be executed consecutively, one after the other.
