To generate the uppercase letter "U" in the Tetris-like environment, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place horizontal block at position 2
repeat               # Repeat the pattern
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place horizontal block at position 2
```

By repeating the pattern of placing vertical and horizontal blocks, we can create the uppercase letter "U" within the allowed space boundaries of the grid.
