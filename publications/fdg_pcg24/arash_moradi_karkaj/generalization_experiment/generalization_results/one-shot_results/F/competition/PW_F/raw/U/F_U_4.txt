To generate the uppercase letter "U", you can follow the following steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other starting from position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks, starting from position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to complete the letter "U":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively and ensure the blocks are stable according to the 2D gravity rules.
