To generate the uppercase letter 'U', we will use a combination of the block types mentioned in the instructions. Here are the commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1.
3. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2.
4. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3.
5. Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3.
6. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1.
7. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3.

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter 'U' within the allowed space boundaries, following the stacking and stability rules.
