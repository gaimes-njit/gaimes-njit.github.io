To generate the uppercase letter "U", we can follow the following steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at position 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) starting at position 2, spanning across positions 2, 3, and 4:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
This will create the letter "U" in the Tetris-like environment.

Please note that it may be necessary to adjust the block positions if they interfere with the height boundary or if the blocks don't fit properly.
