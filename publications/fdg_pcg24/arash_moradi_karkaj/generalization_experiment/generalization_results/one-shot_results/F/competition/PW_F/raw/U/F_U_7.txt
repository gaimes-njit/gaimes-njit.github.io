To generate the uppercase English letter "U", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Please note that these commands should be executed consecutively from top to bottom in order to construct the letter "U" accurately while maintaining stability within the defined environment.
