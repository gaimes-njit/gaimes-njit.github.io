To create the uppercase English letter "V" using the given block types and environment, the ab_drop() commands can be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation: 
- The first four commands (ab_drop('b13', 1) and ab_drop('b13', 2)) create the left slanted part of the "V" by stacking two vertical blocks on top of each other.
- The fifth, sixth, and seventh commands (ab_drop('b31', 2)) create the middle part of the "V" by stacking three horizontal blocks on top of each other.
- By following these commands, the final shape will resemble the uppercase English letter "V".
