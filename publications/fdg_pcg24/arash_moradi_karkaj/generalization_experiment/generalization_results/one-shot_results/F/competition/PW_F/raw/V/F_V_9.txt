To create the letter "V", we need to stack the blocks in a specific pattern. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "V":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

This sequence will create the shape of the letter "V" within the allowed space and maintain structural stability with the gravity rules.
