To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we can use a combination of block types b13 and b31. Here is the stream of commands to construct the letter:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)    # Place b13 block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)    # Place b13 block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)    # Place b13 block at position 3

ab_drop('b31',3)    # Place b31 block at position 3

ab_drop('b13',4)    # Place b13 block at position 4 
ab_drop('b13',5)    # Place b13 block at position 5

ab_drop('b31',5)    # Place b31 block at position 5
```

This sequence of commands will create a capital English letter "W" within the defined boundaries of the grid.
