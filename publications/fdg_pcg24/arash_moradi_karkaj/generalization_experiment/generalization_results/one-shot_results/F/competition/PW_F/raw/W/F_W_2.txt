To generate the uppercase letter "W", we can break it down into three parts: two diagonal lines and a horizontal line connecting them.

Here are the commands to generate the letter "W":
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Place the first block of the first diagonal line
ab_drop('b13', 4)  // Place the second block of the first diagonal line
ab_drop('b31', 7)  // Place the third block of the first diagonal line

ab_drop('b31', 10)  // Place the first block of the horizontal line

ab_drop('b31', 13)  // Place the first block of the second diagonal line
ab_drop('b13', 16)  // Place the second block of the second diagonal line
ab_drop('b31', 19)  // Place the third block of the second diagonal line
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "W" in the given environment.
