To create the capital letter "W" using the given block types and environment, the following commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)   // Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   // Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)   // Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',3)   // Place another horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',4)   // Place another vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13',5)   // Place another vertical straight block at position 5
```

By executing these commands consecutively, the letter "W" will be created in the tetris-like environment.
