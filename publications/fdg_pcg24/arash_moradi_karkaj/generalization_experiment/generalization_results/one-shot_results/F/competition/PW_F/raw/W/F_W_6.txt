To generate the uppercase English letter "W" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Drop a horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 2 to create the first "V" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create the middle part of the "W":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Finally, repeat steps 1 and 2 to create the last "V" shape:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These commands should generate the uppercase English letter "W" in the Tetris-like environment.
