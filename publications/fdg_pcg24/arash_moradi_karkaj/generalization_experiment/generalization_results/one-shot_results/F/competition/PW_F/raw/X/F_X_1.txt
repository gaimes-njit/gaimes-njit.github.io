To generate the uppercase English letter "X", you can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 6
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "X" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring stability and following the gravity rules.
