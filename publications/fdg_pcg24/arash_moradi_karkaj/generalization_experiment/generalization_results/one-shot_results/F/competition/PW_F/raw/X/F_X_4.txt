To generate the uppercase English letter "X" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
This will create the left vertical part of the letter "X".

2. Next, place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks, starting from the second position:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
This will create the middle part of the letter "X".

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create the right vertical part of the letter "X":
```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Here's the complete stream of commands to generate the letter "X":
