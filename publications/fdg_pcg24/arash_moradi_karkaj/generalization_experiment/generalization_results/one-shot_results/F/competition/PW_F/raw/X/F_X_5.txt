To create the uppercase letter "X" using the given block types and command, you can follow these steps:

1. First, create the two diagonal lines of the "X" using the vertical straight block (b13). Place two blocks horizontally at the top of the grid starting from the leftmost position:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Next, create the horizontal line of the "X" using the horizontal straight block (b31). Place it below the two vertical blocks in the middle position:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create the second set of diagonal and horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid, starting from the leftmost position:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "X" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
