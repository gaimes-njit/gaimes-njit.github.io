To generate the uppercase English letter "X" in the Tetris-like environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Next, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width to form the middle of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Finally, repeat steps 1 and 2 one more time:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These commands will create an uppercase English letter "X" in the Tetris-like environment, using the defined block types and gravity rules.
