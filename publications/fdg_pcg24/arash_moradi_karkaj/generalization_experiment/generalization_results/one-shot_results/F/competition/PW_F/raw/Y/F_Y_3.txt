To create the uppercase letter Y, we need to use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)         -> Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)         -> Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)         -> Place a horizontal straight block at position 2

ab_drop('b13',6)         -> Place a vertical straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b13',7)         -> Place a vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b31',7)         -> Place a horizontal straight block at position 7
```

These commands will create the shape of the uppercase letter Y within the allowed space and maintain structural stability according to the gravity rules.

Please note that the numbering of positions starts from 1 and goes up to the maximum width of the grid, in this case, 19.
