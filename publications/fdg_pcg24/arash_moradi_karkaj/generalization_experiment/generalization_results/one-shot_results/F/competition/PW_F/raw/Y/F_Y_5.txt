To generate the uppercase letter "Y" using the given block types and in the defined environment, the following ab_drop() commands should be used:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation:
- Place a vertical straight block of width 1 (b13) at position 1.
- Place another vertical straight block of width 1 (b13) at position 2.
- Place another vertical straight block of width 1 (b13) at position 3.
- Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 (b31) at position 2.
- Finally, place another vertical straight block of width 1 (b13) at position 1 to complete the shape of the letter "Y".

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "Y" using the given block types and following the gravity rules in the defined environment.
