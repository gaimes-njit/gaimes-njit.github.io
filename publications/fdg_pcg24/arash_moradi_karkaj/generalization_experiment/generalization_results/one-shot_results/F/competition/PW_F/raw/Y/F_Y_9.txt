For the letter "Y", you can construct it with the following ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal block on top of the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the second vertical block next to the horizontal block at position 3

The final shape should resemble the uppercase letter "Y" within the boundaries of the allowed space.
