Z: To generate the letter "Z" using the block types b11, b31, and b13, you can follow the sequence of commands below:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
ab_drop('b13', 17)
ab_drop('b31', 19)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "Z" within the allowed space boundaries while maintaining stability according to the gravity rules.
