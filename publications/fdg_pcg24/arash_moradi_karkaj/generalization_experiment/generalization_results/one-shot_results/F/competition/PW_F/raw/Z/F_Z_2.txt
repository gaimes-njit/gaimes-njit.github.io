To generate the uppercase letter "Z" using the block types b11, b31, and b13, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 along the width.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 2 along the width.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 two more times.
4. Finally, end with placing a horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 2 along the width.

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands that generate the letter "Z":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
