To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "F" while satisfying the given constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Define the shape of the structure: The character "F" can be represented using a combination of b11 and b31 blocks. We can break it down into the following components:
   - The main vertical line of the "F" can be represented by a b31 block placed vertically (b13 block).
   - The horizontal line of the "F" can be represented by two b31 blocks placed horizontally above the vertical line (b31 block).

2. Initialize the structure: Use the provided code to initialize the structure as an empty grid.

3. Place the blocks step by step:
   - Start by placing the b31 block representing the vertical line at the bottom center of the structure. Use the ab_drop() function with the appropriate block type and slot number to drop the block.
   - Place the two b31 blocks representing the horizontal line above the vertical line. Use the ab_drop() function with the appropriate block type and slot numbers to drop the blocks.
   - After placing each block, update the structure grid accordingly.

4. Check stability and boundary constraints:
   - After placing each block, check if the structure meets the stability constraints:
     - The b31 blocks representing the horizontal line should be placed on top of the b13 block representing the vertical line to prevent overhangs.
     - The blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
     - The structure should not be separated.
   - Update the structure grid accordingly if any constraints are violated.
   - Also, ensure that the blocks do not intrude on the boundaries of the grid. Update the structure grid if necessary.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the entire "F" structure is formed.

6. Output the final structure grid.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates these steps:

```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Code for ab_drop() function

W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]  # Initialize the structure grid

# Step 3: Place the blocks step by step
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place the vertical line block
# Update structure grid after placing the block

ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Place the left horizontal line block
# Update structure grid after placing the block

ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place the right horizontal line block
# Update structure grid after placing the block

# Step 4: Check stability and boundary constraints
# Update structure grid based on stability and boundary constraints

# Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the entire "F" structure is formed

# Step 6: Output the final structure grid
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Note: This code snippet is just an example and may not generate the exact "F" structure you desire. You may need to adjust the slot numbers and block types based on your specific requirements.
