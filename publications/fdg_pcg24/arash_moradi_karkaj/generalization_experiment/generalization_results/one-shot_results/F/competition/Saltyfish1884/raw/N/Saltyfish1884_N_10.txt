To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all the hard constraints, follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid
```python
W = 20  # Width of the map
H = 16  # Height of the map
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Plan the block placement order and positions to ensure stability. For the character "N", we can start by placing a b31 block on the base (layer 0) in slots 1 to 4, a b13 block on layer 1 in slot 4, and another b13 block on layer 1 in slot 8.

Step 3: Use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop each block according to the planned placement order and positions.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Drop a b31 block in slots 1-4 on layer 0
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Drop a b13 block in slot 4 on layer 1
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Drop a b13 block in slot 8 on layer 1
```

Step 4: Check the stability of the structure. Make sure that all blocks are placed correctly and do not violate any stability rules.

Step 5: If the structure is stable, the final result will resemble the character "N" as desired.

Note: Adjust the block placement order and positions as needed to meet the stability and constraint requirements. The provided code is only an example and may not meet all the given requirements.
