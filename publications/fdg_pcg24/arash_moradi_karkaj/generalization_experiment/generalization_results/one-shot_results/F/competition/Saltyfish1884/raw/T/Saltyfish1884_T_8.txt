To generate a stable "T" structure that meets all the given constraints, we need to carefully choose the dropping positions and order of the blocks. We will use the ab_drop() function to drop each block vertically and ensure stability.

Here is a step-by-step process to create the "T" structure:

1. Initialize the structure grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b11 block at the center of the base layer (layer 0):
```python
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
```

3. Drop the b31 block on top of the b11 block, aligned with its center:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```

4. Drop the b13 block below the b11 block, aligned with its center:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W // 2)
```

By following these steps, we will get a stable structure resembling the character "T" while meeting all the hard constraints.

Here's the complete code:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the structure grid
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Drop the b11 block at the center of the base layer (layer 0)
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)

# Step 3: Drop the b31 block on top of the b11 block, aligned with its center
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)

# Step 4: Drop the b13 block below the b11 block, aligned with its center
ab_drop('b13', W // 2)
```

This code will generate a stable structure resembling the character "T". You can modify the dropping positions and order to create different structures while still meeting the given constraints.
