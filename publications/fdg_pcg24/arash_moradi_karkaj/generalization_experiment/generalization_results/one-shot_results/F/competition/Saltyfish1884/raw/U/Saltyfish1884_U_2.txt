To generate a stable structure resembling the character "U" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b31 block at the center slot (W//2) on the bottom layer (layer 0). This will serve as the base of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

3. Place two b13 blocks on either side of the b31 block at the bottom layer. These blocks will form the sides of the "U":
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2-1)
ab_drop('b13', W//2+1)
```

4. Place a b13 block above each of the previously placed b13 blocks on the second layer (layer 1):
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2-1)
ab_drop('b13', W//2+1)
```

5. Place a b13 block on the third layer (layer 2) at the center slot on top of the b31 block. This will close the top of the "U":
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

6. The resulting structure will resemble the character "U". Print the structure to see the final result:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Note: The order of block placement is crucial to meet the stability constraints. By following the steps above, the structure will be stable and meet the given requirements.
