To create the structure that looks like the letter "B," we can break it down into different blocks and drop them one by one to form the letter.

Here's the step-by-step implementation of the ab_drop() function to create the letter "B":

```python
# Step 1: Drop the square block at the bottom left corner
ab_drop("b11", 1)

# Step 2: Drop the row block above the square block
ab_drop("b31", 2)

# Step 3: Drop the column block to the right of the row block
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Step 4: Drop the row block above the column block
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# Step 5: Drop the square block above the row block
ab_drop("b11", 11)

# Step 6: Drop the column block to the right of the square block
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```

This implementation will create a structure that resembles the letter "B" in a stable manner.

Please note that this implementation assumes that there are no existing blocks in the level before executing these steps.
