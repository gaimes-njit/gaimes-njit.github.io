To generate an "L" shape on the grid, we can start by dropping a "b11" block at the bottom-left corner of the grid. This will represent the base of the "L".

```
ab_drop("b11", 0)
```

Next, we can drop a "b31" block at the center of the grid's bottom row. This will represent the vertical part of the "L".

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Finally, we can drop a "b13" block at the center of the grid's second row from the bottom. This will represent the horizontal part of the "L".

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b11", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
