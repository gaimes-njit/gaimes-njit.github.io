To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "N" in the given 2D grid, we can break it down into two block placements. 

Step 1: Place the base block
We will start by placing a row block "b31" at the bottom-left corner of the grid. This will form the base of the letter "N".
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Step 2: Place the vertical block
Next, we will place a column block "b13" vertically on top of the base block. This will complete the letter "N".
```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

The complete implementation to generate the "N" structure would be:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```
