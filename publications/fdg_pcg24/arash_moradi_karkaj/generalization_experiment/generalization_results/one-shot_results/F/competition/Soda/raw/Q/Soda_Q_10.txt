To build a structure that looks like a capital letter "Q", we can break it down into three blocks: a square block (b11) to form the top part of the "Q", a column block (b13) to form the middle part, and another square block (b11) to form the bottom part.

To ensure stability, we will start building the structure from the bottom and work our way up. 

Here's the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b11", 8)  # Place the bottom square block at x_position = 8
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Place the column block on top of the bottom square block at x_position = 8
ab_drop("b11", 8)  # Place the top square block on top of the column block at x_position = 8

By dropping the blocks in this order and position, we ensure that the structure is stable and resembles the capital letter "Q".
