To generate the letter "Q" in the level, we can break it down into several blocks and place them accordingly. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1:
Place a row block "b31" at the bottom of the grid to serve as the base of the structure. We will place it at x_position=2:

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

Step 2:
Place a column block "b13" on top of the base block to form the vertical stroke of the "Q". We will place it at x_position=2:

```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

Step 3:
Place another row block "b31" on top of the vertical stroke to form the top bar of the "Q". We will place it at x_position=4:

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

Step 4:
Place a square block "b11" on top of the vertical stroke at the center position to complete the letter "Q". We will place it at x_position=2:

```
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion and that the resulting structure resembles the letter "Q" when the level reaches structural stability.
