To create a level that looks like the letter "T", we can break it down into three blocks: a horizontal bar and two vertical bars on either side. We can then drop these blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the first vertical bar on the left side:
ab_drop("b31", 1)

2. Drop the horizontal bar:
ab_drop("b13", 1)

3. Drop the second vertical bar on the right side:
ab_drop("b31", 2)

The complete implementation would be:
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

Please note that the implementation assumes the bottom-left corner of the grid is at (0, 0). If the grid has a different bottom-left corner position, please adjust the drop positions accordingly.
