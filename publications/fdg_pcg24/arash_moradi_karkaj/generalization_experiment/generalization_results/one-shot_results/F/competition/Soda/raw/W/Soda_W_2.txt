First, let's start by creating the base of the "W" character. We can use two row blocks (b31) placed horizontally with a gap in the middle. To make it more stable, we'll use the 3rd column from the left as the pivot point for both row blocks.

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```
Next, we'll add the top and bottom arms of the "W" character. For the top arm, we can use a square block (b11) placed in the 4th column, and for the bottom arm, we can use a column block (b13) placed in the 8th column. Both blocks will be centered vertically.

```
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
```
Finally, we'll add the middle arm of the "W" character. We can use a column block (b13) placed in the 10th column.

```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```
Here's the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```
