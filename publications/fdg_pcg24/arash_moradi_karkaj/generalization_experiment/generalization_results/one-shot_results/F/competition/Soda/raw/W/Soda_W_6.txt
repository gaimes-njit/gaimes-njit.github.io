To create the structure that looks like the letter "W", we can start by placing two row blocks side by side and then placing a column block in the middle. This will form the first "V" shape of the "W". We can then place another column block on top of the first "V" shape to complete the "W". Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)  # Place a column block at x_position 6
ab_drop("b13", 7)  # Place a row block at x_position 7
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Place a row block at x_position 8
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place a row block at x_position 9
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Place a column block at x_position 10
```

This implementation builds the "W" shape from the bottom to the top, and the blocks are well-supported and balanced, ensuring stability.
