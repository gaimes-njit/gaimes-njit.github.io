To build the capital letter "X" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: a vertical bar in the middle and two diagonal bars. 

First, we will place the vertical bar block at the center of the grid. Since the width of the grid is 20, the center cell will be at position 9.

To place the vertical bar block, we will use the `ab_drop()` function with block type "b13" and x_position 9:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, we will place the two diagonal bar blocks. One diagonal will start from the top left corner and end at the bottom right corner, and the other diagonal will start from the bottom left corner and end at the top right corner.

To place the diagonal bar blocks, we will use the `ab_drop()` function with block type "b31". The x_position will be the center point of the diagonal bar.

For the first diagonal bar, the x_position will start from 4 at the top left corner and end at 14 at the bottom right corner:

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```

For the second diagonal bar, the x_position will start from 14 at the bottom left corner and end at 4 at the top right corner:

```
ab_drop("b31", 14)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

By placing these blocks in the specific order and positions, we can create a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "X".
