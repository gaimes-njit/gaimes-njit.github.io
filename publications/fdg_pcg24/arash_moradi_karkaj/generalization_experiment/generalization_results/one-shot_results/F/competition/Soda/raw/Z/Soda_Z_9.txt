To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "Z" (TARGET) using the provided ab_drop() function, we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Place the bottom bar of the "Z"
We will use two column blocks (b13) to create the bottom bar of the "Z". We will place the first block at the 0th x-position and the second block at the 1st x-position.

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

Step 2: Place the diagonal line of the "Z"
Next, we will use a row block (b31) and place it at the 1st x-position to create the diagonal line of the "Z".

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Step 3: Place the top bar of the "Z"
Finally, we will use another two column blocks (b13) and place them at the 1st and 2nd x-positions to create the top bar of the "Z".

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```
