To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "A" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to systematically drop the blocks in a way that satisfies the constraints. Here is the approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given `structure` initialization code.

2. Drop the first block, 'b13', at the center slot, 10, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b13', 10)`. This block will serve as the middle part of the character "A".

3. Drop the second block, 'b31', centered at slot 10 and above the first block to complete the top part of the character "A": `ab_drop('b31', 10)`.

4. Drop the third block, 'b31', centered at slot 7 and above the first block to complete the left side of the character "A": `ab_drop('b31', 7)`.

5. Drop the fourth block, 'b31', centered at slot 13 and above the first block to complete the right side of the character "A": `ab_drop('b31', 13)`.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 two more times to create additional layers of the character "A" above the existing layers.

7. After repeating steps 2-5 twice, you should have a stable structure that looks like the character "A" and meets all the constraints.

Note: The order and positions of block drops are crucial to ensure stability and meet the constraints. Therefore, it is important to follow the precise instructions and use the `ab_drop()` function accordingly.
