To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "E" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop blocks in a specific order and position. Here is one possible approach:

1. Drop a b31 block at slot 7 and layer 2 to form the horizontal middle bar of the "E".
   - `ab_drop('b31', 7)`

2. Drop a b31 block at slot 7 and layer 8 to form the horizontal top bar of the "E".
   - `ab_drop('b31', 7)`

3. Drop a b31 block at slot 7 and layer 14 to form the horizontal bottom bar of the "E".
   - `ab_drop('b31', 7)`

4. Drop a b13 block at slot 13 and layer 2 to form the vertical bar of the "E".
   - `ab_drop('b13', 13)`

5. Drop a b13 block at slot 13 and layer 8 to form the vertical top bar of the "E".
   - `ab_drop('b13', 13)`

6. Drop a b13 block at slot 13 and layer 14 to form the vertical bottom bar of the "E".
   - `ab_drop('b13', 13)`

This sequence of block drops will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "E" and meets the stability constraint. Additionally, by carefully choosing the slot and layer positions, we ensure that the blocks do not intrude on the boundary of the map, meeting the no boundary intrusion constraint.

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid combinations of block drops that can also generate a stable structure resembling the character "E".
