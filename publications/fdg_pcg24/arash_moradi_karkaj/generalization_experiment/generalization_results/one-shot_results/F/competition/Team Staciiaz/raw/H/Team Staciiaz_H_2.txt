To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "H" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic order and position.

Here is the step-by-step process to generate the structure:

1. First, drop a b31 block with its center aligned at slot 2. This block will form the first vertical line of the "H" character. Use the `ab_drop('b31', 2)` function.

2. Next, drop a b13 block with its center aligned at slot 7. This block will form the first horizontal line of the "H" character. Use the `ab_drop('b13', 7)` function.

3. Drop another b31 block with its center aligned at slot 12. This block will form the second vertical line of the "H" character. Use the `ab_drop('b31', 12)` function.

4. Finally, drop a b31 block with its center aligned at slot 2, above the previous blocks. This block will form the horizontal line at the top of the "H" character. Use the `ab_drop('b13', 7)` function.

After following these steps, you will have generated a stable structure that looks like the character "H" and meets all the constraints.
