To generate a stable structure in the shape of the character "N" using the `ab_drop()` function and satisfy all the constraints, the following steps can be followed:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Start by dropping the base of the structure to ensure stability:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop a 3x1 block at slot 9
   ```

3. Place the vertical block of the "N" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop a 1x3 block at slot 9
   ```

4. Place the diagonal block of the "N" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 12)  # Drop a 1x1 block at slot 12
   ```

5. Place the second horizontal block of the "N" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop a 3x1 block at slot 9
   ```

6. Now, the structure should resemble the character "N" and meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

The complete code to generate the stable "N" structure can be as follows:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # Code for the ab_drop() function

# Drop the base
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Place the vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Place the diagonal block
ab_drop('b11', 12)

# Place the second horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Note: The exact slot positions and block types used in the `ab_drop()` function may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your problem. The code provided above is just an example to illustrate the process.
