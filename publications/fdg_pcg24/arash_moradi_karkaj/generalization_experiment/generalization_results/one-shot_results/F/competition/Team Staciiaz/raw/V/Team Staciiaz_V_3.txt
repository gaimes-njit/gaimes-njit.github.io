To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "V" and meets all the constraints, we will need to use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop blocks in a way that satisfies the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is the step-by-step process to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code.
2. Drop a b31 block at slot 8 by calling `ab_drop('b31', 8)`. This will create the bottom part of the "V" structure.
3. Drop a b13 block at slot 7 by calling `ab_drop('b13', 7)`. This will create the left side of the "V" structure.
4. Drop a b13 block at slot 9 by calling `ab_drop('b13', 9)`. This will create the right side of the "V" structure.

The resulting structure will have a stable "V" shape that meets all the constraints.
