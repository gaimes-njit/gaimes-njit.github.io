To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "V" and meets the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a strategic order and position.

Here is a possible approach to follow:
1. Drop a b31 block at slot 8 to form the bottom part of the "V" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```
The structure after this step:
```
     x        
     x        
  xxx         
             
              
              
...
```

2. Drop two b11 blocks at slots 7 and 9 above the b31 block to form the middle part of the "V" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
The structure after this step:
```
     x        
     x        
  xxx         
    x        
             
              
...
```

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 8 above the middle b11 block to complete the top part of the "V" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```
The structure after this step:
```
     x        
     x        
  xxx         
    x        
    x        
    x        
...
```

The final structure forms a stable "V" shape that meets all the constraints:
```
     x        
     x        
  xxx         
    x        
    x        
    x        
...
```

Note: The specific order and positions used in this approach are just one possible solution. There may be multiple valid solutions that meet the given constraints.
