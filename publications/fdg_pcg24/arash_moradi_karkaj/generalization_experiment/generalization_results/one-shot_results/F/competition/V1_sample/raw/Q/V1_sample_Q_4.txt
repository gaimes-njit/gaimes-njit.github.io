To generate a stable structure that looks like the "Q" shape, we will first drop a b31 block at the center of the map (slot 10) from layer H (layer 15). This will represent the vertical stem of the "Q". Next, we will drop a b13 block at slot 12 from layer 14 to create the upper loop of the "Q". Finally, we will drop a b31 block at slot 13 from layer 13 to complete the lower loop of the "Q". By carefully positioning each block and dropping them in the correct order, we can achieve a stable structure that resembles the letter "Q".
