- Row 2: 1x
- Row 3: 5x
- Row 4: 1x
- Row 5: 5x

4. Writing out each x and y for each row:
- Row 1: xxxxx
- Row 2: x
- Row 3: xxxxx
- Row 4: x
- Row 5: xxxxx

5. Indicating the position of each variable:
- Row 1: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
- Row 2: x-1
- Row 3: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
- Row 4: x-1
- Row 5: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5

6. The sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
