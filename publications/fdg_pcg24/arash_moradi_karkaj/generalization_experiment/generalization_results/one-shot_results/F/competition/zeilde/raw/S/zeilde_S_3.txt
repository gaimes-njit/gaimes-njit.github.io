```

2. Listing the asterisks and spaces in each row:

Row 1: "*****"
Row 2: "*"
Row 3: "*"
Row 4: "*****"
Row 5: "    *"
Row 6: "    *"
Row 7: "*****"

3. Using x for asterisks and y for spaces:

Row 2: "x"
Row 3: "x"
Row 4: "xxxxx"
Row 5: "    x"
Row 6: "    x"
Row 7: "xxxxx"

4. Writing out each x and y side-by-side:

Row 1: "xxxxx"
Row 2: "x"
Row 3: "x"
Row 4: "xxxxx"
Row 5: "   x"
Row 6: "   x"
Row 7: "xxxxx"

5. Indicating the position of each variable:

Row 1: "x-1, x-2, x-3, x-4, x-5"
Row 2: "x-1"
Row 3: "x-1"
Row 4: "x-1, x-2, x-3, x-4, x-5"
Row 5: "y-1, x-5"
Row 6: "y-1, x-5"
Row 7: "x-1, x-2, x-3 x-4, x-5"

6. Returning a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
