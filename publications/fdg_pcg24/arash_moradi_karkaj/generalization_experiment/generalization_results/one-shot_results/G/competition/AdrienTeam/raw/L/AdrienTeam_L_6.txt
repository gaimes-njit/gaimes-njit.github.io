The code below shows the sequence of `ab_drop()` calls to create a stable structure resembling "L": 

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. `ab_drop('b13', 1)`: This drops the vertical block ('b13') in the center of slot 1, starting from the bottom layer (layer 0). This forms the longer vertical part of the "L" shape.

2. `ab_drop('b11', 1)`: This drops the small square block ('b11') horizontally in slot 1 above the previous block. It aligns with the center of the previous block.

3. `ab_drop('b11', 0)`: This drops another small square block ('b11') horizontally in slot 0, forming the shorter part of the "L" shape. It aligns with the center of the previous block.

4. `ab_drop('b11', 1)`: This drops another small square block ('b11') horizontally in slot 1, above the previous block. It completes the "L" shape and aligns with the center of the previous block.

The resulting structure will resemble the letter "L" as desired, with no boundary intrusions and blocks aligned with their centers.
