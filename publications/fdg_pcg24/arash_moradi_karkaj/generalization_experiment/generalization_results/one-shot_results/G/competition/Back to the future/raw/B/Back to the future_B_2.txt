To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "B" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block (b31) at the center slot (slot 10) using `ab_drop('b31', 10)`. This block will occupy layers 14, 13, and 12.
```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```
Coordinates: (14, 10), (13, 10), (12, 10)

3. Drop the second block (b13) at the leftmost slot (slot 0) and two layers above the base using `ab_drop('b13', 0)`. This block will provide support for the b31 block.
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```
Coordinates: (10, 0), (9, 0), (8, 0)

4. Drop the third block (b13) at the rightmost slot (slot 19) and two layers above the base using `ab_drop('b13', 19)`. This block will provide support for the b31 block.
```
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```
Coordinates: (10, 19), (9, 19), (8, 19)

5. Drop the fourth block (b11) at the leftmost slot (slot 0) and one layer above the base using `ab_drop('b11', 0)`. This block will create the bottom left part of the "B".
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```
Coordinates: (7, 0)

6. Drop the fifth block (b11) at the leftmost slot (slot 0) and four layers above the base using `ab_drop('b11', 0)`. This block will create the top left part of the "B".
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```
Coordinates: (3, 0)

7. Drop the sixth block (b11) at the rightmost slot (slot 19) and four layers above the base using `ab_drop('b11', 19)`. This block will create the top right part of the "B".
```
ab_drop('b11', 19)
```
Coordinates: (3, 19)

8. Drop the seventh block (b11) at the rightmost slot (slot 19) and one layer above the base using `ab_drop('b11', 19)`. This block will create the bottom right part of the "B".
```
ab_drop('b11', 19)
```
Coordinates: (7, 19)

After following these steps, the structure will resemble the uppercase character "B" and meet all the hard constraints.
