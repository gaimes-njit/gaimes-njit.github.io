To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Place the base of the "D" structure by dropping a b31 block centered at slot 8:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ```

3. Place the vertical part of the "D" structure by dropping a b13 block centered at slot 8, on top of the base:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 8)
   ```

4. Place the top part of the "D" structure by dropping a b31 block centered at slot 5, on top of the vertical part:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 5)
   ```

5. Iterate over the structure and print the coordinates of each block placement:
   ```python
   for i in range(H):
       for j in range(W):
           if structure[i][j] != ' ':
               print(i, j)
   ```

This will generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D" and meets all the hard constraints.
