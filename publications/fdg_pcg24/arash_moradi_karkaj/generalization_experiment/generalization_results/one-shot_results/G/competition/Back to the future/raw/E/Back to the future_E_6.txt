To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "E" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, a step-by-step approach can be followed.

Step 1: Initialize the structure
Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Determine the drop positions for the blocks
Based on the structure of the uppercase letter "E", we need to determine the drop positions for each block. Since the E can be divided into three main parts—a horizontal line in the middle, and two vertical lines on both sides—we can start by dropping the vertical blocks first and then drop the horizontal block in the middle.

Step 3: Drop the vertical blocks (b13)
To create the vertical lines of the uppercase "E", we need to drop the b13 blocks at the appropriate positions. Let's assume the vertical lines will be at slots 3 and 17, and we'll drop them starting from the bottom layer (layer 0) to ensure stability. The drop positions and corresponding calls to `ab_drop()` will be as follows:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Drop b13 block at slot 3
ab_drop('b13', 17)  # Drop b13 block at slot 17
```
Note: These calls need to be wrapped inside a stability check before executing.

Step 4: Drop the horizontal block (b31)
To create the horizontal line in the middle of the uppercase "E", we need to drop the b31 block. Since b31 is wider than the vertical lines, we can drop it at slot 8 to align with the vertical lines. We'll also start dropping it from the bottom layer (layer 0) to ensure stability. The drop position and corresponding call to `ab_drop()` will be as follows:
```
ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Drop b31 block at slot 8
```
Note: This call needs to be wrapped inside a stability check before executing.

Step 5: Check stability and repeat
After each drop, it is important to check the stability of the structure to ensure it does not collapse. If the stability check fails, the drop positions need to be adjusted or blocks need to be dropped in a different order.

Once the stability check passes, the process can be repeated to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase "E".

Remember to also consider the soft constraint of avoiding boundary intrusion (constraint 5.2) while determining the drop positions.
