To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "F" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Define the function `generate_F_structure()` to implement the logic for building the structure.

2. Inside the `generate_F_structure()` function, initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

3. Next, implement the stability check function `is_stable(x, y)` to determine if a block at position `(x, y)` is stable. To check stability, we need to iterate through the layers below the current position and check if there are any gaps or unstable positions. If we encounter an empty space or a block directly below the current position, the block is considered stable. Otherwise, it is not stable.

```python
def is_stable(x, y):
    for i in range(x + 1, H):
        if structure[i][y] == ' ' or structure[i][y] == 'F':
            return True
    return False
```

4. Now, we can implement the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks onto the structure. Use a loop to iterate through each slot and drop the blocks based on the constraints. We can start by dropping the base of the "F", which is a `b31` block centered at slot 9.

```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
```

5. Now, we can start building the structure within the `generate_F_structure()` function. Beginning from the bottom layer, we need to drop the base of the "F" using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`.

6. Next, we need to drop the vertical part of the "F" which consists of two `b13` blocks. We can drop these blocks at slots 7 and 11. However, we need to ensure stability before each drop.

```python
# Drop the first b13 block at slot 7
if is_stable(11, 7):
    ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Drop the second b13 block at slot 11
if is_stable(11, 11):
    ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

7. Finally, we need to drop the horizontal part of the "F" using a `b31` block centered at slot 9. Again, we need to check stability before dropping the block.

```python
if is_stable(15, 9):
    ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

8. Call the `generate_F_structure()` function to generate the structure that resembles the uppercase character "F".

```python
generate_F_structure()
```

The resulting structure will be a stable arrangement of blocks that forms an uppercase "F" shape. The specific coordinates and structure placements may vary depending on the implementation and the randomness introduced during the block stacking process.
