To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "F" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b31 block in the middle of the structure to form the vertical line of the "F". We can use `ab_drop('b31', 10)` to drop the block at slot 10 (middle slot):
```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

3. Drop the b11 block below the center of the b31 block to form the top horizontal line of the "F". We can use `ab_drop('b11', 10)` to drop the block at the same slot as the b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

4. Drop the b11 block above and to the left of the center of the b31 block to form the top left corner of the "F". We can use `ab_drop('b11', 9)` to drop the block at slot 9 (left slot):
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

5. Drop the b11 block above and to the right of the center of the b31 block to form the top right corner of the "F". We can use `ab_drop('b11', 11)` to drop the block at slot 11 (right slot):
```
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

6. Drop the b31 block below and to the right of the center of the b31 block to form the bottom horizontal line of the "F". We can use `ab_drop('b31', 11)` to drop the block at the same slot as the b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

7. Drop the b31 block below and to the left of the center of the b31 block to form the bottom left corner of the "F". We can use `ab_drop('b31', 9)` to drop the block at the same slot as the b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Now, the structure should resemble the uppercase letter "F" and meet all the hard constraints. Note that the exact dropping positions and order may vary as long as the resulting structure is stable and resembles the letter "F".
