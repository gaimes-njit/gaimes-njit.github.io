To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "U" and meets all the hard constraints, we will use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block types in a strategic manner. Here's the general approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided `structure` variable.

2. Start by dropping a b13 block (vertical block of height 3) at the center of the base layer. This will act as the left vertical part of the "U" shape.

    ```
    ab_drop('b13', W//2)
    ```

3. Next, drop a b31 block (horizontal block of width 3) right above the previously dropped b13 block to complete the upper part of the left side of the "U" shape.

    ```
    ab_drop('b31', W//2)
    ```

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create the right side of the "U" shape. Drop a b13 block at the center of the base layer and then a b31 block above it.

    ```
    ab_drop('b13', W//2)
    ab_drop('b31', W//2)
    ```

5. To add stability and prevent the structure from collapsing, place b11 blocks (square blocks) beneath the bottom ends of the b31 blocks on both sides. This will provide support for the upper parts.

    ```
    ab_drop('b11', W//2 - 1)
    ab_drop('b11', W//2 + 1)
    ```

6. Finally, drop additional b11 blocks at random positions within the two vertical parts of the "U" shape to add diversity and meet the constraint of generating diverse content.

    ```
    ab_drop('b11', random_slot_within_u_shape())
    ```

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 multiple times to add more stability and diversity to the structure.

With this approach, the generated structure will have a stable "U" shape, with the lower parts providing support for the upper parts. The structure will also meet the constraints of stability, no boundary intrusion, and overall similarity to the uppercase letter "U".
