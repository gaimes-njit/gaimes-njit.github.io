To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "V" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at the center slot (y = W // 2) using the `ab_drop()` function:

```
ab_drop('b13', W // 2)
```

3. Drop two b31 blocks at the slots adjacent to the center slot to form the arms of the "V" shape:

```
ab_drop('b31', W // 2 - 1)
ab_drop('b31', W // 2 + 1)
```

4. To provide additional stability to the structure, drop two b11 blocks at the slots below the center and arm slots:

```
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 - 1)
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 + 1)
```

5. To make the structure similar to the uppercase letter "V", drop b11 blocks on top of the arms of the "V":

```
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 - 1)
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 + 1)
```

6. Finally, drop one more b11 block at the top of the structure to complete the "V" shape:

```
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
```

The resulting structure should resemble the uppercase character "V" and meet all the hard constraints.
