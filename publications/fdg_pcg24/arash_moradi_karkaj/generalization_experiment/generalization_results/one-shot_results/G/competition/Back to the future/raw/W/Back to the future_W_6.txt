To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "W" using the `ab_drop()` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define helper functions for checking stability and checking if a block intrudes on the boundary:
- `check_stability(coord)` - This function takes in the coordinate `(x, y)` of a block and checks if it has a stable support from the blocks below it. If the block is at the bottom layer or is supported by another block below it, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
- `check_boundary(coord)` - This function takes in the coordinate `(x, y)` of a block and checks if it intrudes on the boundary of the map. If the block is within the boundary, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

3. Implement the logic to generate the structure:
- Drop the three blocks of the "W" shape in the following order: `b31`, `b13`, `b31`.
- Before each drop, check the stability of the structure using `check_stability()` for the specific coordinates where the block will be dropped.
- After each drop, check the boundary intrusion of the dropped block using `check_boundary()`.

Here is the code implementation:

```python
# Constants
W = 20  # Width of the grid
H = 16  # Height of the grid

# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Helper functions
def check_stability(coord):
    x, y = coord
    if x == H-1 or structure[x+1][y] != ' ':
        return True
    return False

def check_boundary(coord):
    x, y = coord
    if x < 0 or x >= H or y < 0 or y >= W:
        return False
    return True

# Drop the blocks to form the uppercase "W"
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Drop b31 at coordinates (15, 4)
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop b13 at coordinates (12, 9)
ab_drop('b31', 14)  # Drop b31 at coordinates (15, 14)

# Print the structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Note: This code snippet assumes that 'ab_drop()' is already defined as described in the question. The drop positions (slots) for each block type may need to be adjusted based on the desired output.
