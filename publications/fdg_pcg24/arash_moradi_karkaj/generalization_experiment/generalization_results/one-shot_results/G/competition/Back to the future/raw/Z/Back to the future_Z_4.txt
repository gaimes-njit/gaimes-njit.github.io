To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Z" and meets all the hard constraints, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define a function `is_stable()` to check the stability of the current structure:
```python
def is_stable():
    for i in range(H-1):
        for j in range(W):
            if structure[i][j] != ' ' and (structure[i+1][j] == ' ' or structure[i+1][j-1] == ' ' or structure[i+1][j+1] == ' '):
                return False
    return True
```

3. Use `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks and build the structure:
```python
# Drop the first b31 block
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the second b31 block
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Drop the b13 block to connect the two b31 blocks
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Check stability and drop additional blocks if needed
while not is_stable():
    # Drop additional blocks to provide stability
    ab_drop('b11', 8)
    ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print ''.join(row)
```

This approach builds the structure from bottom to top, using `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks and checking stability after each drop. More blocks can be added if the structure is not stable.

Note: The exact coordinates for `ab_drop()` may vary depending on the specific requirements and desired outcome for the "Z" structure. The example above provides a general approach to building a stable "Z" structure.
