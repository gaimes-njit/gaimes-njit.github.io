To generate the structure resembling the capital letter "K" using the `ab_drop()` function, follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the first 'b31' block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This block starts at the 9th slot, centered at slot 10.

3. Place the second 'b11' block on top of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
This block is placed on top of the center of the previous block, on the 9th slot.

4. Place the first 'b13' block on the left side of the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```
This block is placed on the 7th slot.

5. Place the second 'b11' block on top of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
This block is placed on top of the center of the previous block, on the 9th slot.

6. Place the third 'b31' block on the right side of the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This block starts at the 9th slot, centered at slot 10.

7. Place the third 'b13' block on the left side of the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```
This block is placed on the 7th slot.

The resulting code using the `ab_drop()` function is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```
