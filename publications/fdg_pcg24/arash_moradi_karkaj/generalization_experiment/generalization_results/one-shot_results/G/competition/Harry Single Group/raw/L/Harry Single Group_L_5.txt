To form a shape resembling the letter "L", we can first place a b31 brick horizontally on the ground and then stack a b13 brick vertically on top of it, aligned with the right side of the b31 brick. Here's the code to generate the structure:

```python
# Map Initialization
map = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    global map
    
    if x == 'b31':
        # Check if the brick will collide with the right boundary
        if y + 1 >= 20:
            return
        # Check if the cells below the brick are occupied
        for i in range(3):
            if map[0][y-1+i] == 1:
                return
        # Place the brick on the ground
        for i in range(3):
            map[0][y-1+i] = 1
        
    elif x == 'b13':
        # Check if the brick will collide with the right or top boundary
        if y >= 20 or y + 2 >= 16:
            return
        # Check if the cells below or to the right of the brick are occupied
        for i in range(3):
            if map[i][y] == 1 or map[i][y+1] == 1 or map[i][y+2] == 1:
                return
        # Place the brick on top of the b31 brick
        for i in range(3):
            map[i][y] = 1
    
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 8)

# Print the generated structure
for row in map:
    print(row)
```

This code will output the following structure:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
