To create the structure "C" using only the ab_drop('blocktype',x position) command, we can break it down into the following steps:

1. Place the first vertical block (b31) on the left side of the box:
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   
2. Place the horizontal block (b13) on top of the vertical block, slightly shifted to the right:
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   
3. Place the second vertical block (b31) on the right side of the horizontal block:
   ab_drop('b31', 2)

This sequence of commands will create a "C" shape structure inside a 20*16 box.
