To generate the capital letter "C", we can start by creating the foundation of the letter with a horizontal straight block (b31) followed by two vertical straight blocks (b13) to form the curved part of the letter. Then, we can add two square blocks (b11) above the curved part to complete the letter.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "C":

ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place another square block at position 4 (stacked on top of the previous one)
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2 (stacked on top of the previous one)

When executed consecutively, these commands will create the shape of the letter "C" within the defined environment.
