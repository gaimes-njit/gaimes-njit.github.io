To form the letter "M" using the given block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Place a block of type b31 at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`
   This will represent the left slanted line of the "M".

2. Place a block of type b13 at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
   This will represent the left vertical line of the "M".

3. Place a block of type b13 at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
   This will represent the middle vertical line of the "M".

4. Place two blocks of type b11 at position 4 (one above the other): 
   `ab_drop('b11', 4)` and `ab_drop('b11', 4)`
   These will represent the two bottom corners of the "M".

5. Place a block of type b31 at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`
