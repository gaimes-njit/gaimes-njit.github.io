To generate the uppercase letter "N", we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "N" within the allowed space boundaries and adhere to the gravity rules.
