To generate the uppercase letter "A", we need to construct it using the given block types and follow the gravity rules. Here are the steps to create the letter "A":

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, just below the first block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, aligned with the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Place two 1x1 square blocks (b11) at position 4, one on top of the other:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

5. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, aligned with the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

After executing these commands in order, you will have successfully generated the uppercase letter "A" within the defined boundaries.

Complete solution:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
