To construct the uppercase letter "A", we can break it down into three blocks: one horizontal straight block (b31), one vertical straight block (b13), and one 1x1 square block (b11). 

To start, we need to create the foundation of the letter, which consists of a horizontal straight block (b31) placed at position 2. We can do this using the ab_drop() command as follows:

``` 
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Next, we need to add the two vertical straight blocks (b13) to form the sides of the letter "A". We can place them at positions 1 and 2. 

``` 
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Finally, we need to add two 1x1 square blocks (b11) on top of the vertical straight blocks to complete the letter "A". We can place them at position 4. 

``` 
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

Therefore, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "A" would be:

``` 
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```
