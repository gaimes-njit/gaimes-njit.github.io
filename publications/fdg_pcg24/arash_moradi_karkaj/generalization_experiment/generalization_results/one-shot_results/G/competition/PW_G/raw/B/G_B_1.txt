To generate the uppercase English letter "B" using the given block types and the defined environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2. This will serve as the foundation for the letter.
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 above the foundation block.
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 above the foundation block.
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

4. Place a square block (b11) at position 4, in line with the foundation block. This will be the top-right part of the letter.
```
ab_drop('b11',4)
```

5. Place another square block (b11) at position 4, just below the previously placed block. This will be the bottom-right part of the letter.
```
ab_drop('b11',4)
```

6. Finally, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, above the top-right part of the letter. This will be the top part of the letter.
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```
