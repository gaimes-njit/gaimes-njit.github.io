To generate the uppercase English letter "B", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place the square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place another square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
```

These commands will create the letter "B" within the allowed space boundaries.
