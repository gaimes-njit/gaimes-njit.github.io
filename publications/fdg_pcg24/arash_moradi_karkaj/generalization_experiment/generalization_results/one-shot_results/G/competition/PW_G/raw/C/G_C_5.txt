To construct the uppercase letter "C", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This sequence starts by placing a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 2 along the width. Then, two vertical straight blocks (`b13`) are placed at positions 1 and 2. Finally, another horizontal straight block (`b31`) is placed at position 2.

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "C" with correct positioning and structural stability.
