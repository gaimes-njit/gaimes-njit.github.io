To generate the uppercase letter "C", you can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Each command represents placing a block of the corresponding type at the specified position along the width. By executing these commands consecutively, you will create the letter "C" in the Tetris-like environment while ensuring structural stability with gravity rules.
