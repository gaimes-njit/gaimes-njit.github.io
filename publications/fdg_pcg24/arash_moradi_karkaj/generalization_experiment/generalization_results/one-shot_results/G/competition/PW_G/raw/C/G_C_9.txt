To construct the uppercase letter "C", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the specified order to create the letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries while adhering to the gravity rules.
