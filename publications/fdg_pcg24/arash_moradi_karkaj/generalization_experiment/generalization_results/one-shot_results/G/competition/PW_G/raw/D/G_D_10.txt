To generate the uppercase letter "D", we can use the following stream of commands using the block types:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)          # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)          # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)          # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)          # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)          # Place another square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 2)          # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "D" in the Tetris-like environment, following the stacking and stability rules.
