To generate the uppercase letter "D", we would need to use a combination of block types b31, b13, and b11. Here is the stream of commands to construct the letter "D":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

These commands will place each block one by one, following the specified grid boundaries and gravity rules. By executing these commands in order, the letter "D" will be generated in the Tetris-like environment.
