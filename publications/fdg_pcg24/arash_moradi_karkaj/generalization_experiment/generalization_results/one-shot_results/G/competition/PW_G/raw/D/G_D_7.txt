To generate the uppercase letter "D", we need to create a specific arrangement of the block types in the defined environment. Here is the solution:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)     # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)     # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)     # Place another vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)     # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)     # Place another square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)     # Place another horizontal block at position 5
```

By executing these commands consecutively, it will generate the uppercase letter "D" in the defined environment with the given block types.
