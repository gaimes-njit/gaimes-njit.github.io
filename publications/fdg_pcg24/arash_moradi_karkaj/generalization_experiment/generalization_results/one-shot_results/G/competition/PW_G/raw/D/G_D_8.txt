To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at X position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block at X position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at X position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the horizontal straight block at X position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place the 1x1 square block at X position 4
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the horizontal straight block at X position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place the 1x1 square block at X position 5
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "D" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
