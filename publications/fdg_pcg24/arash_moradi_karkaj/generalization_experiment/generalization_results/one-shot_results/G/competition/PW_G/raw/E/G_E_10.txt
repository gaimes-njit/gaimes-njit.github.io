To generate the uppercase letter "E", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

This sequence starts by creating the horizontal bar at the top of the letter using the b31 block type. Then, two vertical bars are placed using the b13 block type to form the central part of the letter. Finally, two small squares, represented by the b11 block type, are added at the bottom of the letter to complete the structure.

This sequence of commands ensures that the blocks are stacked in a stable manner following the gravity rules, and the resulting arrangement resembles the uppercase letter "E" within the allowed space boundaries.
