E: To construct the letter "E", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Please note that this is just one possible solution. There may be other valid arrangements of blocks that can also form the letter "E".
