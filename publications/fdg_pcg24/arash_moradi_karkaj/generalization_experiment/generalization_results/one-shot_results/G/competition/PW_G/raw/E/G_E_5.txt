ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place the first square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place the second square block at position 4
