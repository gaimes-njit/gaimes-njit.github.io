ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place a small square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place another small square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place another small square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place another small square block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 1
