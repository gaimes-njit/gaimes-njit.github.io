To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a horizontal straight block of width 3 (b31) at position 1.
- Next, we place a vertical straight block of height 3 (b13) at position 1, right below the previously placed block.
- We continue by placing another vertical straight block of height 3 (b13) at position 2, to the right of the previous block.
- Then, we place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 4, on top of the second vertical block.
- Another 1x1 square block (b11) is placed at position 4, on top of the previously placed block.
- Finally, we place another horizontal straight block of width 3 (b31) at position 2, above the vertical blocks.

This sequence of commands will create the letter "F" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and the allowed space boundaries.
