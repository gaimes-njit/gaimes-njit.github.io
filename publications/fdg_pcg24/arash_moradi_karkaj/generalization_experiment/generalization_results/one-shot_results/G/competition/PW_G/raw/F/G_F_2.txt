To create the uppercase letter "F" using the given block types, we need to follow the specific ab_drop() commands to place each block in the desired position.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "F":

```
ab_drop('b11',1)  // Place a 1x1 square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',1)  // Place another 1x1 square block above the previous one
ab_drop('b11',1)  // Place another 1x1 square block above the previous one
ab_drop('b31',2)  // Place a horizontal straight block starting at position 2
ab_drop('b13',1)  // Place a vertical straight block starting at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  // Place another vertical straight block starting at position 2
```

By following these commands in sequence, the blocks will be placed in the grid to form the letter "F" while adhering to the gravity rules and space boundaries.
