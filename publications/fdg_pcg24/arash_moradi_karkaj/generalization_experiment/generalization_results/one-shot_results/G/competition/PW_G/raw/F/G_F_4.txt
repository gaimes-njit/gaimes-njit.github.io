To create the letter "F" using the given block types and gravity rules, you can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

This sequence will result in the creation of the uppercase English letter "F" within the allowed space boundaries.
