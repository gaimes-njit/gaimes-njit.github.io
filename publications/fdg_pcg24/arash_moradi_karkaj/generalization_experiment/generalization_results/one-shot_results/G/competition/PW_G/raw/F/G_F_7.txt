To generate the uppercase letter "F" using the provided block types and gravity rules, you can follow the following commands:

``` 
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block of width 3 units (b31) at position 1. This will form the top line of the letter "F".
2. Next, place two square blocks of size 1x1 (b11) at positions 2 and 3. These blocks will form the vertical line of the letter "F".
3. Place another horizontal straight block of width 3 units (b31) at position 2. This will form the bottom line of the letter "F".
4. Finally, place two vertical straight blocks of height 3 units (b13) at positions 1 and 2. These blocks will connect the top and bottom lines to complete the letter "F".

Following these commands exactly will result in the formation of the uppercase letter "F" within the allowed space boundaries.
