To create the uppercase letter "F" using the given block types and instructions, you can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place another 1x1 block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "F" within the allowed space boundaries and maintain structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
