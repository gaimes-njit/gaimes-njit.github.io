To create the capital letter "H" in the Tetris-like environment, you can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place the first square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the second square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place the third square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the third horizontal block at position 4
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries, satisfying the stacking and stability rules.
