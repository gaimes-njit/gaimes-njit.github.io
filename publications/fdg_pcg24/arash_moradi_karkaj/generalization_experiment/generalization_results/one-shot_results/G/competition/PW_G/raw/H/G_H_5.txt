To create the uppercase letter "H", the following commands can be used:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, creating the left vertical stroke of the letter "H".
- Then, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, extending the left vertical stroke downwards.
- Next, we place two 1x1 square blocks (b11) at position 4, creating the horizontal stroke of the letter "H".
- Finally, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, creating the right vertical stroke of the letter "H".

Note: Please ensure that each command is executed consecutively and in the correct order to build the letter "H" accurately within the given constraints.
