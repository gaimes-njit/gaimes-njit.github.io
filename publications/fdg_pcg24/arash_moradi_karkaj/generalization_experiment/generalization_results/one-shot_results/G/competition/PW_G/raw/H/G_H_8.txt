To generate the English letter "H" using the given block types and environment, here is a stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place another vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place another horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place another horizontal block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place another vertical block at position 6
```

These commands will create the uppercase English letter "H" within the allowed space and following the 2D gravity rules.
