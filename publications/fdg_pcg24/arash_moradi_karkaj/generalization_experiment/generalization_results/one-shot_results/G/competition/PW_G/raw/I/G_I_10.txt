To generate the uppercase English letter "I" using the given command and block types, you can follow the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command places a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 along the width.
2. The second to fourth commands place vertical straight blocks ('b13') at position 1 along the width.
3. The fifth command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 along the width.

By executing these commands consecutively, you will create the uppercase letter "I" within the allowed space boundaries and following the gravity rules.
