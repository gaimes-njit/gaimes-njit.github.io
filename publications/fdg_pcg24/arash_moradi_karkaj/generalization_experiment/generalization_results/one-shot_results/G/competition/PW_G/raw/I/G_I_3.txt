To generate the uppercase English letter "I", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "I" in the Tetris-like environment, while ensuring stability and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
