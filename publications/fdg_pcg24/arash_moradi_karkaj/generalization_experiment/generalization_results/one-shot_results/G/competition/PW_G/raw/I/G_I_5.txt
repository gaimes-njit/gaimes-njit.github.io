To generate the uppercase English letter "I", we can use the following stream of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation of the commands:
1. `ab_drop('b31',1)`: This command places a horizontal (width=3, height=1) block at position 1, creating the top part of the letter "I".
2. `ab_drop('b13',2)`: This command places a vertical (width=1, height=3) block at position 2, extending downwards from the top part of the letter "I".
3. `ab_drop('b13',2)`: This command places another vertical block at position 2, continuing the downward extension of the letter "I".
4. `ab_drop('b13',2)`: This command places one more vertical block at position 2, completing the vertical line of the letter "I".
5. `ab_drop('b31',1)`: This command places another horizontal block at position 1, creating the bottom part of the letter "I" and connecting it to the vertical line.

By following these commands, you will be able to generate the uppercase English letter "I" within the defined environment and gravity rules.
