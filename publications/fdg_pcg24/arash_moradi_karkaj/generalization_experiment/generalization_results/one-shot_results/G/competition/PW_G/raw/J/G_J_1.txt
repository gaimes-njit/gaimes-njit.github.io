To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Explanation:

1. Place four 1x1 square blocks ('b11') consecutively in the first column (x=1) to form the vertical stem of the letter "J".
2. Place two horizontal straight blocks ('b31') in the second column (x=2) to form the base of the letter "J".
3. Place three vertical straight blocks ('b13') from the third column (x=3) to the first column (x=1) to form the top of the letter "J".

By following these steps, the uppercase English letter "J" will be accurately represented in the Tetris-like environment.
