To generate the uppercase letter "J", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place another vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place another vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)    # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)    # Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 3)    # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 3)    # Place another square block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "J" within the allowed space boundaries.
