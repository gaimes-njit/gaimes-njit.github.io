To generate the uppercase letter "J", follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 and position 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. Place two square blocks (b11) at position 4, overlapping each other:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 4)
   ab_drop('b11', 4)
   ```

4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

The above sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "J" in the Tetris-like environment.
