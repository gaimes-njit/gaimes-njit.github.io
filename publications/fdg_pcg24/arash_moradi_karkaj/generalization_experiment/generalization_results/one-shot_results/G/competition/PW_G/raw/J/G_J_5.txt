To generate the uppercase English letter "J", you will need to use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "J" within the allowed space and according to the gravity rules.
