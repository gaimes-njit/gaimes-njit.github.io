To create the uppercase letter "K" using the block types mentioned, we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter "K" while ensuring stability with respect to the gravity rules.
