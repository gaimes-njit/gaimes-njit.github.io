To generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the necessary positions to form the letter "K" while ensuring structural stability with the gravity rules.
