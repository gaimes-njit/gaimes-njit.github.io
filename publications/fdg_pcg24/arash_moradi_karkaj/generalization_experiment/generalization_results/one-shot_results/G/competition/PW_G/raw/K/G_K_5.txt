To generate the uppercase letter "K", you can use the following series of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical straight block underneath the first horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical straight block next to the first one
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the second horizontal straight block underneath the two vertical blocks
```

These commands will create the uppercase letter "K" in the Tetris-like environment.
