To generate the uppercase letter "K," we can follow the instructions given in the example for the letter "G" and make some modifications.

The stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "K" would be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```
