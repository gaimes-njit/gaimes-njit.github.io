To create the uppercase English letter "L" using the given block types, the following stream of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands starts by placing a horizontal straight block (block type b31) at position 1. Then, a vertical straight block (block type b13) is placed on top of it, also at position 1. Another vertical straight block (block type b13) is placed next to it, at position 2. Two square blocks (block type b11) are then placed on top of the vertical blocks, at position 2. Finally, another horizontal straight block (block type b31) is placed on top of the square blocks, at position 1. This results in the formation of the letter "L" in the Tetris-like environment.
