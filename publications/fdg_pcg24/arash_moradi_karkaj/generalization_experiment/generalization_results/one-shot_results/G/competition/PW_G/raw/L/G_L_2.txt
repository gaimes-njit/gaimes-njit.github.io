To generate the uppercase letter "L", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

This will create a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, followed by a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 1 and 2.

This configuration resembles the uppercase letter "L" within the allowed space boundaries.
