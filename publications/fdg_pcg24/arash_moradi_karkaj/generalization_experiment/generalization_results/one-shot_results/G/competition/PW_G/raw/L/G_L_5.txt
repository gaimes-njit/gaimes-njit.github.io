To generate the uppercase letter "L", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will create a vertical straight block on the left side of the grid, followed by another vertical straight block next to it, forming the vertical part of the letter "L". Finally, a horizontal straight block will be placed at the top to complete the letter.

Note: Make sure to execute the commands consecutively, one after the other, to achieve the desired result.
