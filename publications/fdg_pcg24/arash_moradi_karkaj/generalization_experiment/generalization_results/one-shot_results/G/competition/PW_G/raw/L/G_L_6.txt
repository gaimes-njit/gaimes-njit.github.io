To construct the uppercase English letter "L," we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places the horizontal straight block at position 1.
- The second command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places the vertical straight block at position 1.
- The third command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block at position 2.

By following these commands, you can successfully generate the uppercase English letter "L" in the defined environment.
