To create the uppercase letter "L", we can start by placing a b31 block at the 2nd position along the width. Then, we can place a b13 block at the 1st position along the width, followed by another b13 block at the 2nd position along the width. Finally, we can place two b11 blocks at the 4th position along the width, and lastly another b31 block at the 2nd position along the width.

Here are the commands to create the uppercase letter "L":

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```
