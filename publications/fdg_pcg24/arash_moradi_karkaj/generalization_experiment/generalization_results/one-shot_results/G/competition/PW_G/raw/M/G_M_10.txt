To create the uppercase English letter "M" within the designated environment, you would need to use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b31',6)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "M" by stacking and positioning the block types as described in the task section, while adhering to the gravity rules and boundaries of the environment.
