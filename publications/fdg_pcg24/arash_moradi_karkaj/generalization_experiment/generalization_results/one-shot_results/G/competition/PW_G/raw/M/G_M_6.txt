To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',5)
ab_drop('b13',9)
ab_drop('b31',13)
ab_drop('b31',14)
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable and accurately represented "M" shape within the allowed space boundaries.
