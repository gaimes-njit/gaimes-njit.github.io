To generate the capital English letter "N", we can follow the instructions below:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2. This will serve as the foundation for the letter.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, right next to the foundation block.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, adjacent to the previous block.

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. To complete the top part of the letter, place two 1x1 square blocks (b11) at position 4.

```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

5. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to complete the bottom part of the letter.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "N" would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
