To generate the uppercase letter "N", you can follow the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the first vertical straight block on top of the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Place the second vertical straight block next to the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  // Place the second horizontal straight block next to the second vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Place the third vertical straight block next to the second horizontal block at position 3
```

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively, one after the other, to create the desired "N" shape within the defined boundaries.
