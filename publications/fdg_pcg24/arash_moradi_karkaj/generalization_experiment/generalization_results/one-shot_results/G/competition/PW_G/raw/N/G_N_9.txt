To generate the uppercase letter "N" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Place the first horizontal block (b31) at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place the first vertical block (b13) at position 1 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place the second vertical block (b13) at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Place the first small square block (b11) at position 4 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

5. Place the second small square block (b11) at position 4 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

6. Place the second horizontal block (b31) at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These commands will construct the shape of the letter "N" within the specified boundaries and gravity rules.
