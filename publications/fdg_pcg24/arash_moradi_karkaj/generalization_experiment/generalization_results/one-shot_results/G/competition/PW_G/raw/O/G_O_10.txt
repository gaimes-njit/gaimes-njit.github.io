To generate the uppercase English letter "O", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "O" by placing the block types in the defined environment, following the gravity rules. The blocks are placed consecutively, starting from the left side (X position 1).
