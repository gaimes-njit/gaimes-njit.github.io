To create the uppercase letter "O", we will need to use a combination of block types b31, b13, and b11.

Here is the stream of commands to construct the letter O:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Please note that these commands need to be executed consecutively and in the specified order. This will create the letter O within the boundaries of the allowed space.
