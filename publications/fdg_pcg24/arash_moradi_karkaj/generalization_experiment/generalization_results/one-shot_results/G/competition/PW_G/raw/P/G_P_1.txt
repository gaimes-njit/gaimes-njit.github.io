To generate the uppercase letter "P", we can follow the following set of ab_drop() commands:

1. Start by placing a b31 block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a b13 block on top of the previous block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another b13 block on top of the previous block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Place a b11 block on top of the previous block at position 4:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

5. Place another b11 block on top of the previous block at position 4:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

6. Finally, place another b31 block on top of the previous block at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The complete set of commands to generate the letter "P" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
