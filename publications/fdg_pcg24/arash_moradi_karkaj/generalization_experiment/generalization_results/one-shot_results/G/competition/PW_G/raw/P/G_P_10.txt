To create the uppercase letter "P", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation of the commands:
1. `ab_drop('b31', 1)` - This command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 along the width. This is the top part of the letter "P".
2. `ab_drop('b13', 1)` - This command places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width. This is the stem of the letter "P".
3. `ab_drop('b13', 2)` - This command places another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 along the width. This completes the stem of the letter "P".
4. `ab_drop('b11', 4)` - This command places a square block (b11) at position 4 along the width. This is the top part of the loop in the letter "P".
5. `ab_drop('b11', 4)` - This command places another square block (b11) at position 4 along the width. This completes the loop in the letter "P".
6. `ab_drop('b31', 2)` - This command places another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width. This is the bottom part of the letter "P".

By following these commands, you will be able to create the uppercase letter "P" within the defined environment.
