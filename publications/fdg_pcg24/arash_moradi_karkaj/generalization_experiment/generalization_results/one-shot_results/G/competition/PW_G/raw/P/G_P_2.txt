To generate the uppercase English letter "P", you can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
- First, you need to place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 along the width.
- Next, place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2 along the width. This will form the top part of the letter "P".
- Then, place two 1x1 square blocks ('b11') at position 4 along the width. These will form the vertical line of the letter "P".
- Finally, place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2 along the width. This will complete the bottom part of the letter "P" and form its shape.

By following these ab_drop() commands, you will generate the uppercase English letter "P" in the Tetris-like environment.
