To generate the uppercase English letter "P", we will need to use the following commands:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
4. Place a square block (b11) at position 4: `ab_drop('b11', 4)`
5. Place another square block (b11) at position 4: `ab_drop('b11', 4)`
6. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

The sequence of commands should resemble the letter "P" while following the gravity rules and staying within the allowed boundaries.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
``` 

Executing these commands in the given environment should result in the formation of the uppercase letter "P".
