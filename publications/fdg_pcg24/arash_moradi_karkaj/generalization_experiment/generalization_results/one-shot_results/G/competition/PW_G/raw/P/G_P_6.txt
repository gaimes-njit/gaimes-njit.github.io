To construct the uppercase letter "P" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2. This will form the foundation of the letter.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 and position 2. This will create the vertical portion of the letter.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Now, we need to add the two horizontal bars at the top and bottom of the vertical portion. Drop a square block (b11) at position 4 for both bars.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

4. Finally, to complete the letter "P", add another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, connecting the two vertical bars.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
