To generate the uppercase letter "P", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "P" accurately within the allowed space boundaries, following the gravity rules. Make sure to execute the commands consecutively, as shown above.
