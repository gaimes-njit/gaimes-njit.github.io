To generate uppercase English letter "Q", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place another square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
```

These commands will stack the blocks in a way that resembles the uppercase letter "Q" within the allowed space and gravity rules.
