To create the uppercase letter "R", we can follow the steps below:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, just below the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, next to the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Place a square block (b11) at position 4, below the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

5. Place another square block (b11) at position 4, right next to the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

6. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, below the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

By following these steps, we will have successfully created the uppercase letter "R" in the Tetris-like environment.
