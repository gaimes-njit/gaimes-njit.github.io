R: The foundation for the letter R can be made by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width. This can be done using the ab_drop('b31', 2) command. 

Next, we need to add the vertical straight blocks (b13) to form the diagonal segment of the letter R. Place a vertical straight block at position 1 and another one at position 2 using ab_drop('b13', 1) and ab_drop('b13', 2) commands respectively. 

To complete the letter R, add two 1x1 square blocks (b11) at position 4 using ab_drop('b11', 4) and ab_drop('b11', 4) commands. 

Finally, add another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to close the letter R using ab_drop('b31', 2) command.

Overall, the sequence of commands to generate the letter R would be:

``` 
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
