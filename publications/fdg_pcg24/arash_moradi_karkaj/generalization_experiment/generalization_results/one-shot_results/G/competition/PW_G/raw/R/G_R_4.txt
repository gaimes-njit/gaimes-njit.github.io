To generate the uppercase English letter "R", we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This sequence will construct the letter "R" in the defined environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
