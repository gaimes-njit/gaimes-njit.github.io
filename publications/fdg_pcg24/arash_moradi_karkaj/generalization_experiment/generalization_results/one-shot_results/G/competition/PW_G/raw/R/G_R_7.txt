To generate the uppercase letter "R", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place another square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 2
```

By following these commands, you will successfully generate the uppercase letter "R" in the Tetris-like environment.
