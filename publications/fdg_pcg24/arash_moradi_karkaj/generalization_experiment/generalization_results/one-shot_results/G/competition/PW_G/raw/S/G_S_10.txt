To generate the uppercase English letter "S", follow the below sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:
- The first three commands create the top horizontal line of the letter "S".
- The next three commands create the middle horizontal line of the letter "S".
- Finally, the last three commands create the bottom horizontal line of the letter "S".

Make sure to follow the command sequence and position the blocks correctly to form the desired letter "S" within the boundaries of the allowed space.
