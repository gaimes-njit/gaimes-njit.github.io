To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will create the letter "S" within the allowed space boundaries, following the stacking and stability rules.
