To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',1)  # Place 1x1 block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)  # Place another 1x1 block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)  # Place another 1x1 block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',4)  # Place another 1x1 block at position 4
ab_drop('b11',5)  # Place another 1x1 block at position 5
ab_drop('b13',5)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',4)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',5)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b11',6)  # Place another 1x1 block at position 6
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase English letter "S" within the allowed space and with stability according to the gravity rules.
