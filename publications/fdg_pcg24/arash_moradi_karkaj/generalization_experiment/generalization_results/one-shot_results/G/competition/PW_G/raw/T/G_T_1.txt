To generate the uppercase English letter "T", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',4)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the grid according to the specified block types, creating the shape of the letter "T" while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
