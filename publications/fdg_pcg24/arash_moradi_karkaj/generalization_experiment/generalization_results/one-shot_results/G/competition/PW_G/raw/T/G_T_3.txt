To generate the uppercase English letter "T", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

This will create a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 2 along the width, followed by a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1 and another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 2.
