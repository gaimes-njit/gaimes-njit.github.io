To generate the uppercase letter "T", you can follow these steps:

Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width.
``` 
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width.
``` 
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Follow it with another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 along the width.
``` 
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Then, place a small square block (b11) at position 4 along the width.
``` 
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

Finally, place another small square block (b11) at position 4 along the width to complete the top of the "T".
``` 
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

Here is the complete stream of commands to generate the letter "T":

``` 
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
