To create the uppercase English letter "U" using the given block types and the defined environment, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a b31 block at position 2 to form the left vertical line of the "U":
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Drop a b13 block at position 1 to form the top horizontal line of the "U":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Drop another b13 block at position 2 to complete the top horizontal line of the "U":
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Secure the top horizontal line by dropping two b11 blocks at position 4:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

5. Finally, drop a b31 block at position 2 to form the right vertical line of the "U":
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Your sequence of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "U" will look like this:

``` 
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
