To generate the uppercase letter "U", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b13',7)
ab_drop('b31',7)
```

These commands will place the block types in the specified positions to form the letter "U" within the allowed space and in accordance with the gravity rules.
