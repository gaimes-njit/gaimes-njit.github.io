U: The letter U can be constructed by placing a vertical straight block (b13) followed by two horizontal straight blocks (b31) in the middle, and another vertical straight block (b13) on the right side. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter U:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
```
