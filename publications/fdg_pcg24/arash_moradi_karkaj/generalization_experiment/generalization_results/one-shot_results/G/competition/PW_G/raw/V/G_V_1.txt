To create the uppercase letter "V" using the given block types and commands, you can follow the steps below:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block ('b31') at the 2nd position along the width: `ab_drop('b31',2)`. This will create the foundation for the letter.

2. Next, place a vertical straight block ('b13') at the 1st position along the width: `ab_drop('b13',1)`. This will form the left side of the letter.

3. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at the 2nd position along the width: `ab_drop('b13',2)`. This will complete the left side of the letter.

4. To add stability to the letter, place two 1x1 square blocks ('b11') at the 4th position along the width: `ab_drop('b11',4)`.
   
5. Finally, to create the right side of the letter, place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at the 2nd position along the width: `ab_drop('b31',2)`.

The complete sequence of commands to generate the letter "V" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```
