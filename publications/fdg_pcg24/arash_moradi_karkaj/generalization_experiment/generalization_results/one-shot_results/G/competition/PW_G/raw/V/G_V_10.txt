To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

1. ab_drop('b31',1) - Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1.
2. ab_drop('b13',3) - Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 3.

The resulting commands would be:
```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```
