To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries.
