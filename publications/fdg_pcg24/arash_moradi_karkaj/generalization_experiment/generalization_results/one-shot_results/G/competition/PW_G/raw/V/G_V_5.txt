To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will create the shape of the letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
