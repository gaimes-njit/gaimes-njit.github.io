To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:

1. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1.
2. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') next to the previous block at position 2.
3. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') on top of the two vertical blocks at position 2.

After executing these commands, you should have a stable structure resembling the letter "V" within the allowed space.
