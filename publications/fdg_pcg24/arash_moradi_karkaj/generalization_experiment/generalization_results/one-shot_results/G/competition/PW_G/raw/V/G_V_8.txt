Here is the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "V":

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the specified positions to form the letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries.
