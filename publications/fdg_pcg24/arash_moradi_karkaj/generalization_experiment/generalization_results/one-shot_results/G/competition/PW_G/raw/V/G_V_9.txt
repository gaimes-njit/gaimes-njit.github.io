To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can use a combination of block types b13 and b31. 

First, we need to create the two diagonal lines of the "V" shape. We can start by placing a b13 block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
Next, we place a b31 block starting from position 2 to create the diagonal line:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

To complete the "V" shape, we need to mirror the previous steps on the other side. We start by placing a b31 block at position 18:
```
ab_drop('b31', 18)
```
Finally, we place a b13 block at position 19 to complete the diagonal line:
```
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "V" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 18)
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```
