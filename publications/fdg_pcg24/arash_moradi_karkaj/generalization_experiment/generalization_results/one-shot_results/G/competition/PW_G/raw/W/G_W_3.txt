To create the uppercase letter "W" using the given block types and gravity rules, you can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place another square block at position 6
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 5
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "W" in the given Tetris-like environment. Remember to start constructing the shapes from position 1 along the width.
