To create the capital letter "W", we can use a combination of the mentioned block types to construct the shape. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
These commands will place the blocks in the required positions to form the letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries.
