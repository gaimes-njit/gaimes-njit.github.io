To generate the uppercase letter "W", we need to strategically place the block types in the given environment. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

By following the above sequence of commands, the blocks will be placed in a way that resembles the letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries and adhering to the gravity rules.
