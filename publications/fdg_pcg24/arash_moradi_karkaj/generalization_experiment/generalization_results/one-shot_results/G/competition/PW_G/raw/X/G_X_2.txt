To create the uppercase letter "X" using the given block types and gravity rules, the following sequence of ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in a way that forms the letter "X" within the allowed space boundaries and follows the gravity rules. The blocks are dropped consecutively, starting from the left side (X position 1), to create the desired shape.
