To generate the uppercase English letter "X" using the given block types and environment, follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 2 with `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.

2. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1 with `ab_drop('b13', 1)`.

3. Place another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 2 with `ab_drop('b13', 2)`.

4. Place a square block (`b11`) at position 4 with `ab_drop('b11', 4)`.

5. Place another square block (`b11`) at position 4 with `ab_drop('b11', 4)`.

6. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 2 with `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.
