To create the uppercase letter "X", we will use a combination of the block types mentioned in the prompt. Here is a sequence of ab_drop() commands that will generate the letter "X":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the required pattern to form the letter "X".
