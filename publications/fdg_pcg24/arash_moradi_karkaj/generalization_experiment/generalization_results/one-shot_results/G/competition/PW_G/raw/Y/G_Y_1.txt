To generate the uppercase letter "Y", we can break it down into three parts: the left vertical stroke, the diagonal stroke, and the right vertical stroke.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands needed to generate the letter "Y":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1) # Left vertical stroke - Start at position 1, drop a vertical straight block
ab_drop('b13', 2) # Left vertical stroke - Move one position to the right, drop another vertical straight block
ab_drop('b31', 3) # Diagonal stroke - Move two positions to the right, drop a horizontal straight block
ab_drop('b13', 4) # Right vertical stroke - Move three positions to the right, drop a vertical straight block
ab_drop('b13', 5) # Right vertical stroke - Move one position to the right, drop another vertical straight block
```

Make sure to enter the commands consecutively within the three backticks in the response section.
