To generate the uppercase letter "Y" using the given block types and environment, you can follow the sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This sequence will construct the letter "Y" within the allowed space and ensure structural stability according to the gravity rules.
