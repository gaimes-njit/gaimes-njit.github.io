To create the uppercase English letter "Y", we need to place the blocks in the following order:

- Place the first horizontal straight block (b31) at y = 2.
- Place the first vertical straight block (b13) at y = 1.
- Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at y = 2.
- Place the first square block (b11) at y = 4.
- Place the second square block (b11) at y = 4.
- Place the second horizontal straight block (b31) at y = 2.

The sequence of ab_drop() commands to achieve this is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```
