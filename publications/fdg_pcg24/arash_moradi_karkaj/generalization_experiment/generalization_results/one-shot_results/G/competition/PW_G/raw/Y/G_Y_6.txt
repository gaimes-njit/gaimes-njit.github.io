To generate the uppercase letter "Y" in the defined environment, you would need to use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

These commands will place the block types in the specified positions to create the letter "Y" while ensuring the stability with the gravity rules.
