To generate the uppercase letter "Y", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by creating the vertical line of the letter. Place two vertical blocks (b13) one on top of the other at position 2 along the width:
``` 
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

2. Next, create the diagonal slant of the letter. Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 1 along the width, just below the top vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

3. Complete the letter "Y" by adding the horizontal line at the bottom. Place two square blocks (b11) side by side at position 4 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

4. Finally, reinforce the diagonal slant by adding another horizontal block (b31) at position 2 along the width, just below the previous one:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```
