To generate the uppercase letter "Z", we need to follow the specified environment rules and use the provided block types. Here's the stream of commands to construct the letter "Z":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1. This forms the top part of the "Z".
2. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1. This forms the vertical line of the "Z".
3. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2. This completes the vertical line of the "Z".
4. Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2. This forms the bottom part of the "Z".

By following these commands, you will accurately represent and fit the uppercase English letter "Z" within the allowed space boundaries.
