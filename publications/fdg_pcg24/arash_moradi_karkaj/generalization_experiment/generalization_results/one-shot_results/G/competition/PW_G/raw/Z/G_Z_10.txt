To generate the uppercase letter "Z", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)      # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)      # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)      # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)      # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)      # Place another square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 2)      # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
```
