To generate the uppercase letter "Z" using the given block types and environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, which will serve as the foundation for the letter. Use the command:
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, just above the foundation block. Use the command:
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, next to the previous block. Use the command:
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   
4. To complete the top diagonal of the letter, place a square block (b11) at position 4. Use the command:
   ab_drop('b11', 4)
   
5. Place another square block (b11) at position 5, next to the previous block. Use the command:
   ab_drop('b11', 5)
   
6. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, just below the top diagonal. Use the command:
   ab_drop('b31', 2)

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "Z" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
