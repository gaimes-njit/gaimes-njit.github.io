To generate the letter "Z", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing two horizontal straight blocks (b31) at positions 1 and 2 to form the top of the letter "Z".
- Then, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 to form the diagonal of the letter "Z".
- Next, we continue with two horizontal straight blocks (b31) at positions 4 and 5 to complete the middle section of the letter "Z".
- Finally, we place two 1x1 square blocks (b11) at positions 6 and 7 and end with two horizontal straight blocks (b31) at positions 8 and 9 to form the bottom of the letter "Z".

Please note that the positions mentioned in the ab_drop() commands are relative to the X position 1 and the width of each block type. Make sure to follow the gravity rules and not exceed the height boundary of the allowed space.
