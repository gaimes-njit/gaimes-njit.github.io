To generate the uppercase letter "Z" using the given block types, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place the horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1. This will be the top part of the letter "Z".
2. Place the vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1. This will be the diagonal line of the letter "Z".
3. Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2. This will be the middle part of the letter "Z".
4. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2. This will be the other diagonal line of the letter "Z".
5. Place the final horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3. This will be the bottom part of the letter "Z".

Please note that the stream of commands should be executed consecutively in order to generate the letter "Z" accurately.
