To generate a structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) at the bottom layer (layer 0) to create a solid base for stability. For example:
```
structure[H-1][2] = 'b13'
structure[H-1][3] = 'b11'
structure[H-1][4] = 'b13'
```

3. Place a b31 block on top of the base to form the horizontal part of the "F" character. This block should be placed on a solid base to prevent overhangs. For example:
```
structure[H-2][3] = 'b31'
structure[H-2][4] = 'b31'
structure[H-2][5] = 'b31'
```

4. Place two b11 blocks vertically on top of the horizontal part to form the vertical parts of the "F" character. The blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing. For example:
```
structure[H-3][4] = 'b11'
structure[H-4][4] = 'b11'
```

5. Make sure the structure is not separated by checking that there are no empty spaces between the blocks. Adjust the position of the blocks if necessary.

6. Finally, use the `ab_drop()` function to drop each block onto the structure. The dropping position and order are crucial for stability. Use techniques from the block-stacking problem to determine the optimal positions and order.

Note: The specific order and positions for dropping the blocks may vary depending on the stability constraints and any additional constraints that may not have been mentioned. It is important to experiment and optimize the placement to ensure stability and meet all requirements.

Once the structure is generated, use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks onto the structure:

```
for row in structure:
    for block in row:
        if block != ' ':
            ab_drop(block, row.index(block))
```

This will drop each block onto the structure according to their positions.

Review the final structure and adjust as needed to ensure stability and meet all constraints.
