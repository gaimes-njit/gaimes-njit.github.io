To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Define the character "H" using the block types available (b11, b31, and b13). By analyzing the shape of the character "H," we can determine the placement of different block types to form the desired structure.

Step 2: Start by placing the base blocks (b11 or b13) at the bottom layer to create a stable foundation. This ensures that the structure does not collapse due to overhangs.

Step 3: Place the b31 blocks on top of the base blocks to form the vertical segments of the "H." These blocks should be aligned with the base blocks to maintain stability.

Step 4: Add additional b11 or b13 blocks on top of the vertical segments to complete the horizontal part of the "H."

Step 5: Place the remaining b11 blocks in a stable manner to connect the vertical and horizontal segments and maintain the stability of the structure.

Step 6: Iterate through the slots from left to right, determining the drop position for each block type using the ab_drop() function. The drop position should be carefully chosen to ensure stability and take into account the previously placed blocks.

By carefully following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all the hard constraints.
