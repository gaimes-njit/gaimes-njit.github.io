To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Define the necessary variables and parameters.

```
W = 20  # Number of slots (width)
H = 16  # Number of layers (height)

# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) to form the stable foundation.

```
# Place two b11 blocks on the base layer to form a solid base
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 13)
```

Step 3: Place the central b31 block on top of the base blocks.

```
# Place a b31 block on top of the base blocks
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 4: Place the upper b11 block to complete the structure.

```
# Place a b11 block on top of the central b31 block
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

Step 5: Finalize the structure by placing b11 blocks to connect the upper and lower parts.

```
# Place three b11 blocks to connect the upper and lower parts of the structure
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

This arrangement will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" while satisfying all hard constraints. You can further optimize the placement of blocks to minimize boundary intrusion if desired.
