To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "P" using the ab_drop() function and meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully determine the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
W = 20  # width of the map
H = 16  # height of the map

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]  # empty structure grid
```

2. Determine the order of dropping the blocks. Since the b31 block must be placed on a solid base to prevent overhangs, we need to drop the base blocks (b11 or b13) first, and then drop the b31 block on top.

3. Drop the first base block (b11) to create a stable base:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop a b11 block at slot 9
```

4. Drop the second base block (b11 or b13):
```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Drop a b11 block at slot 10
```
Note: The specific slot numbers are chosen based on the desired shape of the character "P" represented by the stable structure.

5. Drop the third base block (b11 or b13):
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop a b13 block at slot 9
```
Note: The b13 block is placed vertically to form the upright part of the character "P".

6. Drop the b31 block on top of the base blocks to complete the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop a b31 block at slot 9
```
Note: The b31 block is placed horizontally to form the curved part of the character "P" on top of the upright part.

7. The resulting structure will resemble the character "P" and meet all hard constraints, including stability and no boundary intrusion.

Note: The specific slot numbers and block types used in steps 3 to 6 can be adjusted to create different variations of the character "P" structure. The key is to ensure stability and fulfillment of the constraints.
