To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X", we can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base blocks (b11) at the bottom of the structure to form a solid base.
```
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop('b11', i)
```

Step 3: Place the connecting blocks (b13) diagonally to form the center of the "X".
```
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop('b13', i)
    ab_drop('b13', W-1-i)
```

Step 4: Place the top blocks (b31) horizontally above the connecting blocks to complete the "X" shape.
```
for i in range(1, W-1):
    ab_drop('b31', i)
```

Step 5: Check the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

- Stability:
    - The b31 blocks are placed on top of the base blocks (b11 or b13) to ensure stability.
    - The blocks are placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
    - The structure is connected without any separation.

- No boundary intrusion:
    - By following the drop positions given in the steps above, the blocks should not intrude on the map's boundaries.

Step 6: Print the final structure grid to see the result.
```
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The code provided above is a high-level implementation of the steps required to generate the structure resembling the character "X" while meeting all the given constraints. You may need to modify the code according to the specific requirements or additional constraints.
