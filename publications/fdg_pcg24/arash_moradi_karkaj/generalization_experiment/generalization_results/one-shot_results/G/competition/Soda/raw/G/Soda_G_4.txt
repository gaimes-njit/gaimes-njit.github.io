To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "G" in Tetris, we can break it down into multiple blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop a row block (b31) with x_position=8 to create the base of the "G".
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

2. Drop a column block (b13) with x_position=9, starting from the second row, to create the vertical part of the "G".
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

3. Drop a column block (b13) with x_position=7, starting from the third row, to create the horizontal part of the "G".
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

4. Drop a column block (b13) with x_position=9, starting from the fourth row, to complete the vertical part of the "G".
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

5. Drop a column block (b13) with x_position=8, starting from the fourth row, to join the horizontal and vertical parts of the "G".
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

6. Drop a square block (b11) with x_position=8, starting from the fourth row, to close the top of the "G".
```
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will create a structure resembling the capital letter "G" in Tetris, with optimal stability and similarity.
