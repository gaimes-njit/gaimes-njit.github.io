To build the letter "K" in the level, we need to place a total of 7 blocks in a specific order.

Step 1: Place the base blocks
The base of the "K" consists of a row block ("b31") and a column block ("b13").
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Step 2: Place the vertical bar
Next, we need to place a column block ("b13") vertically on top of the base.
```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Step 3: Place the diagonal extensions
To form the diagonal extensions of the "K", we need to place two row blocks ("b31") diagonally. One on the top-left and the other on the top-right of the vertical bar.
```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal bar
Finally, we need to place a row block ("b31") horizontally at the top to complete the letter "K".
```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Complete implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
