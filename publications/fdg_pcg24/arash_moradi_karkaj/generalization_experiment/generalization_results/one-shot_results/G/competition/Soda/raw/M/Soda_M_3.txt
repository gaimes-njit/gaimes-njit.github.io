To create the letter "M" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks. Here is the step-by-step implementation to create the "M" shape:

1. Begin by placing a row block ("b31") at the bottom of the grid, centered at x_position=5.
2. Place a column block ("b13") above the row block, centered at x_position=5.
3. Finally, place another row block ("b31") above the column block, centered at x_position=5.

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
# Step 1: Place the first row block at the bottom.
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# Step 2: Place the column block above the row block.
ab_drop("b13", 5)

# Step 3: Place the second row block above the column block.
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

This implementation ensures stability by starting from the bottom and building the structure upwards. The resulting shape will resemble the letter "M" in the level.
