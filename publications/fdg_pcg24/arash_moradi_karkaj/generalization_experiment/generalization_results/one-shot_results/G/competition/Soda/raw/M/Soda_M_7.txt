To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "M", we can break it down into three blocks: a bottom row block, a middle column block, and another bottom row block. 
To maintain stability, we will start by placing the bottom row blocks and then stack the middle column block on top of them.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)    # Place the first bottom row block at column 8
ab_drop("b11", 9)    # Place the middle block of the bottom row at column 9
ab_drop("b31", 10)   # Place the last bottom row block at column 10
ab_drop("b13", 9)    # Place the middle column block at column 9 (centered horizontally)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top construction approach, ensuring stability. The blocks are centered horizontally at the desired positions to resemble the letter "M".
