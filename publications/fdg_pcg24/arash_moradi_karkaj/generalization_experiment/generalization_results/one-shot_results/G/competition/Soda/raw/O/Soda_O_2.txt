To generate a structure that looks like a capital "O" in the level, we can start by placing a row block (`b31`) horizontally in the middle of the grid. This will serve as the base of the "O". 

Next, we can place two column blocks (`b13`) on each side of the row block to form the sides of the "O". We need to ensure that the column blocks are placed in a way that the overall structure remains stable.

Finally, we can place a square block (`b11`) on top of the row block to complete the "O" shape.

Here is the complete implementation:

`ab_drop("b31", 9)` // Place the row block horizontally at x_position=9
`ab_drop("b13", 8)` // Place the column block on the left side at x_position=8
`ab_drop("b13", 10)` // Place the column block on the right side at x_position=10
`ab_drop("b11", 9)` // Place the square block on top at x_position=9

This implementation will generate a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "O".
