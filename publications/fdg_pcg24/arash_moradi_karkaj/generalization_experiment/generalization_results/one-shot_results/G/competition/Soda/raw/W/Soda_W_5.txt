To build the structure that resembles the letter "W" in Tetris, we can break it down into three blocks and stack them in a bottom-to-top fashion. The bottom-most block will be a column block "b13", followed by two row blocks "b31" stacked on top of each other. Here is the implementation:

```
# Drop the bottom block (column block)
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# Drop the first row block
ab_drop("b31", 3)

# Drop the second row block
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```

In this implementation, the column block is dropped at x_position=8 to center it in the middle of the grid. The first row block is dropped at x_position=3, and the second row block is dropped at x_position=13. By stacking these blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, we will achieve a structure that resembles the letter "W" when viewed from the top.
