To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "C" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully choose the block types and their drop positions to meet the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints.

Here's an example approach to achieve the goal:

1. Drop the b13 block at slot 2 to create the bottom curve of the "C" shape. This block will start at layer 1 to avoid boundary intrusion.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Drop the b13 block at slot 2 again, but this time at layer 4 to create the middle curve of the "C" shape.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Drop the b11 block at slot 3 and layer 6 to create the top curve of the "C" shape.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

By following these steps, the `ab_drop()` function will create a stable structure that resembles the character "C" without intruding on the boundary of the map.

Note: The exact drop positions and block types may vary depending on the specific constraints and requirements of the block stacking problem.
