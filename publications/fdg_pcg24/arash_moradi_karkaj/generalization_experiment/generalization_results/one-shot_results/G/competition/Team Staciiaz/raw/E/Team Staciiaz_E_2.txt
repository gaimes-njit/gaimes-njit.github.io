To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "E" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions W x H:
   
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the b31 block at slot 3, layer 13 to create the vertical part of the "E":
   
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 3)
   ```

3. Drop the b31 block at slot 3, layer 9 to create the middle horizontal part of the "E":
   
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 3)
   ```

4. Drop the b31 block at slot 3, layer 5 to create the bottom horizontal part of the "E":
   
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 3)
   ```

5. Drop the b13 block at slot 3, layer 1 to close the bottom part of the "E":
   
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

6. Drop the b31 block at slot 10, layer 9 to create the top horizontal part of the "E":
   
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

7. Drop the b31 block at slot 10, layer 5 to create the middle horizontal part of the "E":
   
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

8. Drop the b13 block at slot 10, layer 1 to close the top part of the "E":
   
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 10)
   ```

9. The resulting structure will resemble the character "E" and meet all the constraints.

Here's the code snippet that implements these steps:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Drop the b31 block at slot 3, layer 13
ab_drop('b31', 3)

# Step 3: Drop the b31 block at slot 3, layer 9
ab_drop('b31', 3)

# Step 4: Drop the b31 block at slot 3, layer 5
ab_drop('b31', 3)

# Step 5: Drop the b13 block at slot 3, layer 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)

# Step 6: Drop the b31 block at slot 10, layer 9
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Step 7: Drop the b31 block at slot 10, layer 5
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Step 8: Drop the b13 block at slot 10, layer 1
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# The resulting structure will resemble the character "E"
```

Note: It is important to ensure that the blocks are dropped in the correct order and position to maintain stability and avoid boundary intrusion.
