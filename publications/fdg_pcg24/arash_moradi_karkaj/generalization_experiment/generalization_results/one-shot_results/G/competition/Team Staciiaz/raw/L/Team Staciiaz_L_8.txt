To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function strategically. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve the goal:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the b11 block at slot 1 to create the bottom-left corner of the "L" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 1)
   ```

   The structure should now look like:

   ```
   [[' '],
    ['x'],
    [' '],
    [' '],
    ...
   ```

3. Drop the b13 block at slot 1 to create the vertical part of the "L" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

   The structure should now look like:

   ```
   [[' '],
    ['x'],
    [' '],
    ['x'],
    [' '],
    ...
   ```

4. Drop the b31 block at slot 4 to create the horizontal part of the "L" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 4)
   ```

   The structure should now look like:

   ```
   [[' '],
    ['x'],
    [' '],
    ['x'],
    [' '],
    [' ', ' ', ' ', 'x', 'x', 'x', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
    ...
   ```

5. Drop the b13 block at slot 6 to create the top part of the "L" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 6)
   ```

   The structure should now look like:

   ```
   [[' '],
    ['x'],
    [' '],
    ['x'],
    [' '],
    [' ', ' ', ' ', 'x', 'x', 'x', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'x', ' ' ,' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
    ...
   ```

6. Complete the remaining slots and layers with empty spaces to satisfy the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. For example, fill the remaining slots with empty spaces:
   ```python
   for x in range(W):
       for y in range(H):
           if structure[y][x] == ' ':
               structure[y][x] = 'x'
   ```

   The final structure should look like:

   ```
   [['x'],
    ['x'],
    ['x'],
    ['x'],
    ['x'],
    ['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
    ...
   ```

By following this step-by-step approach, you can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" and meets all the specified constraints.
