To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "M" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to determine the dropping positions and order of blocks based on the block-stacking problem techniques. Here is an approach to meet all the constraints:

1. Drop the first block (b31) at slot 8 using the `ab_drop()` function. This block will be dropped from layer 15 to layer 14.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

2. Drop the second block (b31) at slot 9. This block will be dropped from layer 15 to layer 14.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Drop the third block (b11) at slot 7. This block will be dropped from layer 14 to layer 13.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```

4. Drop the fourth block (b11) at slot 10. This block will be dropped from layer 14 to layer 13.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

5. Drop the fifth block (b13) at slot 6. This block will be dropped from layer 13 to layer 10.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

6. Drop the sixth block (b13) at slot 11. This block will be dropped from layer 13 to layer 10.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

7. Drop the seventh block (b31) at slot 5. This block will be dropped from layer 10 to layer 9.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

8. Drop the eighth block (b31) at slot 12. This block will be dropped from layer 10 to layer 9.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

9. Drop the ninth block (b11) at slot 4. This block will be dropped from layer 9 to layer 8.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

10. Drop the tenth block (b11) at slot 13. This block will be dropped from layer 9 to layer 8.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 13)
```

11. Drop the eleventh block (b31) at slot 3. This block will be dropped from layer 8 to layer 7.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

12. Drop the twelfth block (b31) at slot 14. This block will be dropped from layer 8 to layer 7.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

13. Drop the thirteenth block (b11) at slot 2. This block will be dropped from layer 7 to layer 6.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

14. Drop the fourteenth block (b11) at slot 15. This block will be dropped from layer 7 to layer 6.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 15)
```

15. Drop the fifteenth block (b31) at slot 1. This block will be dropped from layer 6 to layer 5.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

16. Drop the sixteenth block (b31) at slot 16. This block will be dropped from layer 6 to layer 5.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 16)
```

17. Drop the seventeenth block (b11) at slot 0. This block will be dropped from layer 5 to layer 4.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

18. Drop the eighteenth block (b11) at slot 17. This block will be dropped from layer 5 to layer 4.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 17)
```

19. Drop the nineteenth block (b13) at slot 6. This block will be dropped from layer 4 to layer 1.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

20. Drop the twentieth block (b13) at slot 11. This block will be dropped from layer 4 to layer 1.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

After following these steps, the `structure` grid will represent a stable structure that looks like the character "M".
