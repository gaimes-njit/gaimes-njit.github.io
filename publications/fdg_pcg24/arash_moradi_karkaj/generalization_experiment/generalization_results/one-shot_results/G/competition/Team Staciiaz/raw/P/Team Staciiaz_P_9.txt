To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "P" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in a strategic way. Here is one possible approach:

1. First, we need to drop the base of the structure. We can use the `ab_drop('b31', 7)` to drop a horizontal block of width 3 units centered at slot 7 on the bottom layer (layer 0).

2. Next, we can drop the vertical part of the "P" shape. We can use the `ab_drop('b13', 7)` to drop a vertical block of height 3 units centered at slot 7 on the layer above the base (layer 1).

3. To complete the structure, we can drop another horizontal block on top of the vertical part. We can use the `ab_drop('b31', 7)` to drop a horizontal block of width 3 units centered at slot 7 on the layer above the previous block (layer 2).

By following this strategy, we ensure that the blocks are dropped in a stable manner, with the weight distribution evenly spread and no boundary intrusion.

Note: The specific slot numbers and block types used above are for illustrative purposes only. You can experiment with different slot numbers and block types to create variations of the structure that still meet the constraints.
