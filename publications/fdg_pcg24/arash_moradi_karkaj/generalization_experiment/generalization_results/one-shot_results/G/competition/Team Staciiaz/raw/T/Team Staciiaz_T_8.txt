To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "T" and satisfies all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner.

Here is a step-by-step approach to create the structure:

1. First, we need to drop the base of the "T" structure. Since the base should be stable and not intrude on the boundary, we should drop a horizontal block `b31` centered at slot 9 (W/2).

   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

2. Next, we need to drop the vertical part of the "T" structure. To ensure stability, we should drop a vertical block `b13` centered at slot 9 (W/2) and placed above the base, on the 6th layer (H/4 + 1). 

   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

3. Now, we need to drop the horizontal part of the "T" structure. Again, to ensure stability, we should drop a horizontal block `b31` centered at slot 9 (W/2) and placed above the vertical part, on the 11th layer (3 * H/4 + 1).

   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

After following these steps, the `structure` grid will represent a stable structure that looks like the character "T" and satisfies the constraints.

Keep in mind that the `ab_drop()` function will handle the position and order of dropping blocks, ensuring stability and avoiding boundary intrusion.
