To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "V" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop the blocks in the structure.

First, we need to initialize the structure using the provided code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

Next, we can begin dropping the blocks to form the "V" shape. We can start by dropping a vertical block (`b13`) in the center of the structure, aligned with slot 9:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

This will create the central part of the "V" shape. Next, we can drop two horizontal blocks (`b31`) on top of the vertical block to complete the "V" shape:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

By dropping the blocks in this order, we ensure that the structure is stable and doesn't intrude on the boundaries of the map.

Here's the complete code:

```python
def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # Function implementation (as provided)
    pass

W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "V" and meets all the constraints.
