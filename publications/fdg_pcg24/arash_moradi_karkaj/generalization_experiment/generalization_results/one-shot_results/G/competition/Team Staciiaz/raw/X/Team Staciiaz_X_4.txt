To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "X" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in a strategic manner.

First, we need to create a stable base for the structure by dropping a horizontal block (`b31`) at the center slot (`W//2`) at the bottom layer (`H-1`). This will provide a solid foundation for the rest of the structure.

Next, we can start building the diagonal lines of the "X" shape. We can drop vertical blocks (`b13`) at the leftmost (`0`) and rightmost (`W-1`) slots, at increasing heights from the base layer. We can use a loop to iterate from the bottom layer (`H-1`) to the top layer (`0`), and for each layer, we can drop the vertical block at the corresponding height.

To ensure stability, we need to drop the blocks in a specific order. We should start by dropping the blocks at the lower heights first before moving upwards. This will ensure that the weight is distributed evenly and the structure remains stable.

Here is an example implementation of the `ab_drop()` function to generate the stable structure:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    def get_highest_empty_y_position(x):
        for y in range(H - 1, -1, -1):
            if structure[y][x] == ' ':
                return y
        return -1

    block_shapes = {
        'b11': [(0, 0)],
        'b31': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)],
        'b13': [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (-2, 0)]
    }

    highest_empty_height = get_highest_empty_y_position(x_position)

    if x_position < 0 or x_position >= W:
        print("Invalid x_position")
        return

    if block_type not in block_shapes:
        print("Invalid block type")
        return

    for dx, dy in block_shapes[block_type]:
        y = highest_empty_height + dy
        if y < 0 or y >= H:
            print(f"Invalid x_position for block type '{block_type}'")
            return
        structure[y][x_position + dx] = 'x'
```

Using the `ab_drop()` function, we can generate the stable structure by following these steps:

1. Drop a horizontal block (`b31`) at the center slot (`W//2`) at the bottom layer (`H-1`) to create a stable base.
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

2. Build the left diagonal line of the "X" shape. Start from the bottom layer (`H-1`) and drop a vertical block (`b13`) at slot `0` at the current layer height. Repeat this step for each layer, moving upwards.
```python
for layer in range(H-1, -1, -1):
    ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Build the right diagonal line of the "X" shape. Start from the bottom layer (`H-1`) and drop a vertical block (`b13`) at the rightmost slot (`W-1`) at the current layer height. Repeat this step for each layer, moving upwards.
```python
for layer in range(H-1, -1, -1):
    ab_drop('b13', W-1)
```

After executing these steps, the `structure` variable will contain the stable structure that looks like the character "X" and meets all the constraints.
