To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "X" and meets all the constraints, we can start by dropping the two diagonal blocks first, followed by the horizontal block in the middle.

Here's the step-by-step process to create the structure:

Step 1: Drop the first diagonal block (b13) at slot 4. This will be the bottom-left part of the "X".
ab_drop('b13', 4)

Step 2: Drop the second diagonal block (b13) at slot 15. This will be the bottom-right part of the "X".
ab_drop('b13', 15)

Step 3: Drop the horizontal block (b31) at slot 9. This will be the center part of the "X".
ab_drop('b31', 9)

The resulting structure will resemble the character "X", and it will meet the stability constraint as well as the no boundary intrusion constraint, as all blocks are placed within the boundaries of the map.
