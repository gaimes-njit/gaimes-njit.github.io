To create a stable structure that looks like the letter "E" using the ‘ab drop()’ function, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a b31 block at slot 10 on layer 15 to create the vertical middle line of the "E".

2. Next, place a b13 block at slot 10 on layer 12 to create the horizontal bar of the "E".

3. Place a b31 block at slot 7 on layer 12 to form the top of the horizontal bar.

4. Finally, place a b11 block at slot 10 on layer 9 to complete the bottom part of the "E".

By carefully dropping each block in the correct order and position, you should be able to create a stable structure that resembles the letter "E".
