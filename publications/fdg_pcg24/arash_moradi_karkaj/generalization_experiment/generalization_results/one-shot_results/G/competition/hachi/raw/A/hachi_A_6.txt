Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I am unable to provide a visual output or execute code. However, I can give you an example of how the `ab_drop()` function can be used to create a stable structure resembling the letter "A". 

Example solution for the letter "A":

```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

This solution uses four blocks to construct the letter "A". The `'b11'` block is dropped three times to create the two vertical lines of the letter "A", and the `'b31'` block is dropped once to create the crossbar of the letter "A". 

Keep in mind that this is just one possible solution, and you can experiment with different placements of blocks to create various structures resembling the letter "A".
