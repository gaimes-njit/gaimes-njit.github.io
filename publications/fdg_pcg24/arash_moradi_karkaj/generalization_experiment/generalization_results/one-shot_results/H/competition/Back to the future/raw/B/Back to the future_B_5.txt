To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "B" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided `structure` variable and the dimensions W (width) and H (height).

2. First, drop a vertical block (b13) at the center of the bottom layer (layer 0) using `ab_drop('b13', W//2)`.

3. Check if the dropped block is stable. If not, adjust the drop position until it is stable. Repeat this step until the block is stable.

4. Drop a square block (b11) right above the previously dropped block at the center slot using `ab_drop('b11', W//2)`.

5. Drop a horizontal block (b31) above the square block at the center slot using `ab_drop('b31', W//2)`.

6. Check if the structure from [2,5] to [3,5-7] is stable. If not, adjust the drop positions until they are stable. Repeat this step until the blocks are stable.

7. Drop a vertical block (b13) above the horizontal block at the center slot using `ab_drop('b13', W//2)`.

8. Check if the structure from [4-6,5] to [6-8,5] is stable. If not, adjust the drop positions until they are stable. Repeat this step until the block is stable.

9. The generated structure will resemble the uppercase character "B" if all the hard constraints and stability requirements are satisfied.

Note: The exact coordinates and number of adjustments needed may vary depending on the initial state of the structure and the order of the blocks that are dropped. It is important to ensure stability at each step before proceeding to the next.
