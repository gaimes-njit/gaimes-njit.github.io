To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "H" and meets all the hard constraints, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer by dropping the vertical block b13 at the center slot.

```
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

3. Calculate the stable support slots for the horizontal blocks b31. The stable support slots will be the center slot and the slots adjacent to it.

```
support_slots = [W//2-1, W//2, W//2+1]
```

4. Drop the horizontal block b31 on the layer above the base layer at one of the stable support slots.

```
ab_drop('b31', support_slots[0])
```

5. Drop the vertical block b13 above the horizontal block b31 at the center slot.

```
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

6. Increase the support slots for the next horizontal block b31 to maintain stability.

```
support_slots = [W//2-2, W//2-1, W//2, W//2+1, W//2+2]
```

7. Drop the horizontal block b31 above the previous vertical block b13 at one of the stable support slots.

```
ab_drop('b31', support_slots[0])
```

8. Drop the vertical block b13 above the horizontal block b31 at the center slot.

```
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

9. Repeat steps 6-8 to build the upper part of the structure.

10. Once the structure is complete, check if it resembles the uppercase character "H" by visually inspecting the structure.

11. If necessary, modify the structure by adjusting the placement of the blocks to meet the similarity constraint.

12. Repeat steps 2-11 with different slot configurations and block types to generate diverse structures that resemble the uppercase character "H".

Note: It's important to perform stability checks before each call to ab_drop to ensure that the entire structure remains stable during each drop.
