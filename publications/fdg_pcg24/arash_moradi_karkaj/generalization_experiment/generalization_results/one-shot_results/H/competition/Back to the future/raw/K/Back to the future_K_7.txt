To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "K" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code: 

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Begin by dropping the first part of the "K" shape, which is a b31 block, using the `ab_drop()` function. Choose an appropriate slot position for stability. For example, we can choose slot 4 for the center of the block:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
The block will land on layer 15 and its center will be aligned with slot 4.

3. Next, drop the second part of the "K" shape, which is another b31 block, on top of the first block. Choose a slot position that supports the stability of the structure. For example, we can choose slot 5:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```
The block will land on layer 14 and its center will be aligned with slot 5.

4. Now, drop the third part of the "K" shape, which is a b13 block, to complete the vertical stroke of the "K". Choose a slot position that supports the stability of the structure. For example, we can choose slot 5:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
The block will land on layer 13 and its center will be aligned with slot 5.

5. To create the diagonal stroke of the "K", drop a b11 block in the slot to the left of the vertical stroke. Choose a slot position that supports the stability of the structure. For example, we can choose slot 3:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```
The block will land on layer 12 and its center will be aligned with slot 3.

6. Finally, drop another b11 block in the slot to the right of the vertical stroke. Choose a slot position that supports the stability of the structure. For example, we can choose slot 7:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```
The block will land on layer 12 and its center will be aligned with slot 7.

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 multiple times, dropping additional diagonal strokes of the "K" at different heights to create a diverse and varied structure that still resembles the uppercase character "K".

Note: Before each call to `ab_drop()`, make sure to check the stability of the structure using appropriate stability checks to avoid any accidents.
