To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "L" using the `ab_drop()` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Create an empty structure grid using the `Map Initialization` code provided.

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and center it in the middle slot (slot 9) using the `ab_drop()` function. This will form the vertical part of the "L" shape.

3. Next, drop a b31 block directly on top of the b13 block, centered in the same slot (slot 9). This will form the horizontal part of the "L" shape.

4. To ensure stability and support for the horizontal part, drop a b11 block on the layer above the b31 block, aligned with the end of the b31 block (slot 11).

5. To add more stability to the structure, drop another b11 block on the layer above the previous b11 block, aligned with the center of the b31 block (slot 9).

6. Finally, drop a b11 block on the top layer (layer 15) at the same slot as the previous b11 block (slot 9).

The resulting structure will meet all the hard constraints and resemble the uppercase character "L".
