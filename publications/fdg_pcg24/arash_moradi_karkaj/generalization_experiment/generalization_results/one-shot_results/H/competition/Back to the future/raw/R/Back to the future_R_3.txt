To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "R" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a strategic manner. Here is one possible approach to achieve the goal:

1. Start by dropping the b31 block centered at slot 9 (y=9) on layer 14. This will be the main vertical part of the "R". The drop position can be calculated using the `ab_drop()` function. Store the drop coordinates.

2. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 9 (y=9) on layer 11. This will be the horizontal part of the "R". Check the stability of the structure and adjust the drop position if needed. Store the drop coordinates.

3. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 9 (y=9) on layer 10. This will be the downward stroke of the "R". Check the stability and adjust the drop position if needed. Store the drop coordinates.

4. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 9 (y=9) on layer 6. This will be the base of the "R". Check the stability and adjust the drop position if needed. Store the drop coordinates.

5. Drop a b11 block centered at slot 10 (y=10) on layer 5. This will be a support for the previous b31 block. Check the stability and adjust the drop position if needed. Store the drop coordinates.

6. Drop a b11 block centered at slot 8 (y=8) on layer 5. This will be another support for the previous b31 block. Check the stability and adjust the drop position if needed. Store the drop coordinates.

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to add additional supports to make the structure more stable.

8. Continue dropping blocks to generate the remaining structures of the "R". Use a combination of b11, b13, and b31 blocks to achieve a similar overall shape to the uppercase letter "R".

9. Make sure to check the stability of the structure after each block drop and adjust the drop position if needed.

10. Finally, ensure that the generated structure is diverse and does not always result in the same configuration. You can introduce some randomness in the block placement by randomly choosing the slot positions for each block drop.

Remember to implement the necessary checks for stability and boundary intrusion as per the given constraints.
