To generate a stable structure that resembles the letter "K", we can break down the letter into three parts: the vertical stem, the top horizontal stroke, and the bottom diagonal stroke.

We'll start by dropping the vertical stem using the 'b13' block type. We'll position it at the center of the grid and drop it to the highest possible position:
ab_drop('b13', 9)

Next, we'll drop the top horizontal stroke using the 'b31' block type. We'll position it at the center of the grid and drop it just above the vertical stem to provide stability:
ab_drop('b31', 9)

Finally, we'll drop the bottom diagonal stroke using the 'b11' block type. We'll position it slightly to the left of the center of the grid and drop it to the lowest possible position:
ab_drop('b11', 7)

The code to generate the stable structure resembling the letter "K" is as follows:

ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
