# Solution

Since we need to generate a structure that resembles the letter "L", we can start by dropping the blocks in a specific order to form the basic shape of the letter. 

First, we drop a vertical block ('b13') at the bottom left corner of the map to form the vertical part of the letter "L". 

Then, we drop a horizontal block ('b31') just above the vertical block to form the horizontal part of the letter "L". 

Finally, we drop two vertical blocks ('b13') on top of each other to extend the length of the vertical part of the letter "L".

To summarize, the solution to generate the letter "L" using the ab_drop() function would be as follows:

ab_drop('b13', 0)   # Drop vertical block at left bottom corner
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Drop horizontal block above vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Drop vertical block above horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Drop another vertical block above previous vertical block
