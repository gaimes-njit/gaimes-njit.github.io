To generate a stable structure that resembles the capital English letter "R", we can follow these steps using the ab_drop() function:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Place two b11 blocks on the bottom layer to form the legs of the letter "R". This will provide a stable base for the structure:

ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 14)

3. Place a b31 block on top of the left leg to form the vertical part of the letter "R":

ab_drop('b31', 7)

4. Place two b11 blocks on both sides of the b31 block to form the top horizontal part of the letter "R":

ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 8)

5. Place two b11 blocks above the top horizontal part to complete the letter "R":

ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 8)

The final structure will resemble the capital English letter "R".
