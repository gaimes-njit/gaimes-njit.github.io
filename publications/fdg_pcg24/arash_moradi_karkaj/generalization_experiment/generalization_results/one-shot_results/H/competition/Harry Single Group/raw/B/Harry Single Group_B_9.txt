To form a shape resembling the letter "B" using the available props and ab_drop function, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the map with all cells set to 0.
```
map = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

Step 2: Place the b13 brick vertically on the ground at x_position = 5. This will occupy cells (5, 0), (5, 1), and (5, 2).
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Step 3: Place the b31 brick horizontally on top of the b13 brick at x_position = 6. This will occupy cells (5, 3), (6, 3), and (7, 3).
```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

To ensure stability and avoid boundary collisions, we need to make sure that the cells of each brick do not exceed the field boundaries and the structure remains stable.

Let's implement the code to generate the required structure:

```python
map = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    if x == 'b31':
        # Check if the brick will collide with the boundaries or other bricks
        if y < 0 or y + 2 >= 20 or map[0][y] == 1 or map[0][y + 1] == 1 or map[0][y + 2] == 1:
            return
        # Check stability with the brick below
        if y - 1 >= 0 and (map[1][y - 1] != map[1][y + 1] or map[1][y - 1] != map[1][y + 2]):
            return
        # Drop the brick to the ground
        for i in range(3):
            map[i][y] = map[i][y + 1] = map[i][y + 2] = 1

    elif x == 'b13':
        # Check if the brick will collide with the boundaries or other bricks
        if y < 0 or y >= 20 or map[0][y] == 1:
            return
        # Check stability with the brick below
        if y - 1 >= 0 and (map[1][y - 1] != 0 or map[1][y] != 0 or map[1][y + 1] != 0):
            return
        # Drop the brick to the ground
        for i in range(3):
            map[i][y] = 1

# Place bricks to form the shape resembling the letter "B"
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

After executing the above code, the map will contain the required structure resembling the letter "B".
