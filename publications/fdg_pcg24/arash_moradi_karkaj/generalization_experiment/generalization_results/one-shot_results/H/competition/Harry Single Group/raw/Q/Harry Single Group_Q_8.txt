The key to generating the shape resembling the letter "Q" using the ab_drop() function is to carefully plan the placement of each brick. 

To ensure stability, we will stack the bricks in a way that maintains a balance on both sides of the pivot point. In this case, the pivot point will be the center of the Q shape. 

Here is how we can generate the Q shape:

1. Initialize the field by creating an empty 2D array of size 20x16.

```
field = [[' ' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Start by placing the large vertical brick (b13) at the center-bottom of the field.

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

This will place the brick at the y-axis position 9, occupying cells (9, 0), (9, 1), and (9, 2).

3. Next, place the small horizontal brick (b11) to the right of the vertical brick, slightly above its center.

```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

This will place the brick at the y-axis position 10, occupying cell (10, 3).

4. Finally, place the large horizontal brick (b31) on top of the vertical brick, spanning across its entire width, slightly shifted to the right.

```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

This will place the brick at the y-axis position 8, occupying cells (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 0), (13, 0), and (14, 0).

The final structure will resemble the letter "Q" and will satisfy the stability requirements since the bricks are balanced around the pivot point.

Note: Ensure that the ab_drop() function takes care of avoiding boundary collisions and stopping when cells are already occupied.
