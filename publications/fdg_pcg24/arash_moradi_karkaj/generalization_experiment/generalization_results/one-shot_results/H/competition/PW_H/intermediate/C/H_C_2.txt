To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we need to create a curved shape. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "C" in the defined environment:

ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Create the left vertical line of the letter "C"
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Create the right vertical line of the letter "C"
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Create the horizontal line of the letter "C"

Ensure to place these commands consecutively between three backticks (```).

The final sequence of commands to generate the letter "C" is:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
