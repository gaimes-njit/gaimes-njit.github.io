To generate the uppercase letter "A", we can use a combination of the block types mentioned: b11, b31, and b13.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "A":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place b13 at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place b13 at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place b31 at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place b13 at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place b13 at position 3
```

These commands will construct the uppercase letter "A" in the given environment, following the gravity rules.
