To create the uppercase English letter "A", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
```

This will generate the letter "A" in the Tetris-like environment.
