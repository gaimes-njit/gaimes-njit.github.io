To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we need to stack the blocks in the following pattern:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # bottom horizontal line of the 'A'
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # left vertical line of the 'A'
ab_drop('b13', 4)    # right vertical line of the 'A'
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # top horizontal line of the 'A'
```

Please note that the pattern should be constructed from left to right, starting from the X position 1.
