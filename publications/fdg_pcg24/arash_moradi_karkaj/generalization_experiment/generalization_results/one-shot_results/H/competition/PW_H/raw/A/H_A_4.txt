To create the uppercase letter "A", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

This will first create the two legs of the "A" shape by placing two vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 1 and 3 along the width. Then, a horizontal straight block ('b31') is placed in the middle (position 2) to create the crossbar of the "A". Finally, two more vertical straight blocks are placed at positions 1 and 3 to complete the upper part of the letter.
