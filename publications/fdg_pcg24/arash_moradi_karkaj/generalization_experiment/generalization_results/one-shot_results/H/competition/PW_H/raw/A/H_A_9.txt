To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left and right sides of the grid:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

2. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle, between the two vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

3. Place the two vertical straight blocks (b13) on top of the horizontal block, aligned with the existing vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "A" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```
