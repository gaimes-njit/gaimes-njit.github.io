To generate the uppercase English letter "B" using the ab_drop() commands and the provided block types in the defined environment, the following stream of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "B" by stacking blocks in the correct positions and ensuring structural stability according to the gravity rules.
