To create the uppercase letter "B" using the block types provided, you can follow the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the required positions to form the letter "B" within the allowed space boundaries and complying with the gravity rules.
