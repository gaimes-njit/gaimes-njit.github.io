To generate the uppercase English letter "B", we need to use a combination of the block types b31 and b13 in a specific pattern. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "B" in the defined environment:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Bottom horizontal line
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)

ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Vertical line on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 4)

ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Top horizontal line
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "B" in the Tetris-like environment. Make sure to place each block one by one and follow the specified positions and orientations.
