To generate the uppercase letter "B", we can break it down into three parts: the top horizontal bar, the vertical line in the middle, and the bottom horizontal bar. We will use the block types b31 and b13 to construct the letter.

Here are the commands to generate the letter "B":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)      # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)      # Place the second vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)      # Place the horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)      # Place the third vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)      # Place the fourth vertical block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "B" within the allowed space and follow the gravity rules.
