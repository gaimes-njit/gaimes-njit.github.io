To create the uppercase letter "B", we need to first create the foundation of the letter, then add the middle and upper parts. Here is the stream of commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

These commands will create the letter "B" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and staying within the boundaries.
