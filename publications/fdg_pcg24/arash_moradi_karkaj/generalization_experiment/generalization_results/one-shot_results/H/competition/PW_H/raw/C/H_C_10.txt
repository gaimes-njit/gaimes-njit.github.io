To create the uppercase English letter "C", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "C" in the defined environment with proper stacking and stability.
