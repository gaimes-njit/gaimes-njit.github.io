To generate the uppercase letter "C", you would need to use the following stream of commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation: 
- The first command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places a vertical straight block at position 1 along the width, creating the vertical line of the "C".
- The second command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places a horizontal straight block at position 2, extending to positions 3 and 4. This creates the top part of the "C".
- The third command `ab_drop('b31', 4)` places another horizontal straight block at position 4, extending to positions 5 and 6. This completes the top part of the "C".
- The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places another horizontal straight block at position 2, extending to positions 3 and 4. This creates the bottom part of the "C".
- The fifth command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places another vertical straight block at position 1 along the width, creating the left side of the bottom part of the "C".
- The sixth command `ab_drop('b13', 3)` places another vertical straight block at position 3 along the width, creating the right side of the bottom part of the "C".

By following these commands and using the block types provided, you will be able to generate the uppercase English letter "C" within the defined environment.
