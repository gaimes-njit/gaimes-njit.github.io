To generate the uppercase English letter "C", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',7)
ab_drop('b13',11)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',7)
```

Explanation:
- The first `ab_drop('b13',1)` command places a vertical straight block at position 1, which forms the left side of the letter "C".
- The next `ab_drop('b31',1)` command places a horizontal straight block at position 1, which connects the top and bottom of the letter "C".
- The subsequent `ab_drop('b13',4)` and `ab_drop('b13',7)` commands place vertical straight blocks at positions 4 and 7, respectively, which form the right side of the letter "C".
- The next `ab_drop('b31',1)` command places another horizontal straight block at position 1, further connecting the top and bottom of the letter "C".
- Finally, the last `ab_drop('b13',1)`, `ab_drop('b13',4)`, and `ab_drop('b13',7)` commands place vertical straight blocks at positions 1, 4 and 7, respectively, which complete the left side of the letter "C".

Together, these commands will generate the uppercase English letter "C" within the boundaries of the given environment.
