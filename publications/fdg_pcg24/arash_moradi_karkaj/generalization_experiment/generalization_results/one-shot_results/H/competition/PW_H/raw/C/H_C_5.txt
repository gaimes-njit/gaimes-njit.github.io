To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block on the left side
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the vertical straight block on the right side
```

This will create a shape that resembles the letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries.
