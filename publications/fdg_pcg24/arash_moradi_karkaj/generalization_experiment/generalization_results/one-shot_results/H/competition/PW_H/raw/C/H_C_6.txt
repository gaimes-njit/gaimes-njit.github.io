To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place the vertical straight block on the leftmost side
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place the horizontal straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place another vertical straight block on the leftmost side
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place another vertical straight block on the rightmost side
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place another vertical straight block on the leftmost side
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place another vertical straight block on the rightmost side
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries.
