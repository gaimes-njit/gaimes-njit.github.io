To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Lower horizontal line
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Left vertical line
ab_drop('b13', 8)   # Upper vertical line
ab_drop('b31', 12)  # Upper horizontal line
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Right vertical line
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable and accurate representation of the letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries.
