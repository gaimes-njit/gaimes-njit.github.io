To create the uppercase letter "C", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

This will result in a letter "C" shape formed by stacking and arranging the given block types within the allowed space boundaries.
