To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we need to create the following shape:

```
   b31
  b13
  b13
   b31
```

Here are the commands to construct the letter "C":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Please note that the commands should be executed consecutively, starting from the top-left corner of the grid.
