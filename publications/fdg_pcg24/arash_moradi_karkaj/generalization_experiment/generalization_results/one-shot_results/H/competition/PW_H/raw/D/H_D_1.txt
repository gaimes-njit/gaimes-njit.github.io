To generate the uppercase letter "D", we can use a combination of block types b13 and b31. The steps to construct the letter are as follows:

1. Start by placing two b13 vertical blocks in the first and third column: 
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

2. Next, place a b31 horizontal block in the second column, forming the middle part of the letter: 
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

3. Finally, place two more b13 vertical blocks in the first and third column, aligning with the previously placed blocks: 
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

The stream of commands to generate the letter "D" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
