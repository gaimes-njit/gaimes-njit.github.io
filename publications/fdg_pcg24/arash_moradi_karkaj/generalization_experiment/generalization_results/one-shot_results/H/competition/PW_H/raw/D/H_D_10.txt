To create the uppercase letter "D" using the given block types and rules, we will need to carefully stack and position the blocks. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "D":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Bottom horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Middle horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Top horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Right vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Left vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Top right vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Bottom right vertical block
```

Explanation:
1. We start by placing the bottom horizontal block (b31) at position 1.
2. Next, we place the middle horizontal block (b31) at position 2.
3. Then, we place the top horizontal block (b31) at position 3.
4. After that, we position the right vertical block (b13) at position 3.
5. Following that, we position the left vertical block (b13) at position 1.
6. Then, we position the top right vertical block (b13) at position 3.
7. Finally, we position the bottom right vertical block (b13) at position 1.

By following these ab_drop() commands, we will be able to create the uppercase letter "D" while ensuring structural stability and adherence to the gravity rules.
