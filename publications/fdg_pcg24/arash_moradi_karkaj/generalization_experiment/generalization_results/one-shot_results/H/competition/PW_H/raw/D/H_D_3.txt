To generate the uppercase letter "D", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions (1, 1) and (1, 2) to form the left vertical stroke of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (2, 1) to connect the two vertical blocks and form the top horizontal stroke of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Add another vertical straight block (b13) at position (3, 1) to complete the right vertical stroke of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. To ensure stability and prevent the blocks from falling, we can add some additional blocks below. For example, we can place a square block (b11) at position (3, 2):
```
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the letter "D" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```
