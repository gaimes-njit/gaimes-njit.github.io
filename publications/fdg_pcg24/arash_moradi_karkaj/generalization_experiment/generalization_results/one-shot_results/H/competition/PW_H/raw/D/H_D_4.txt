Here's how you can generate the uppercase English letter "D" using the ab_drop() commands and the block types:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Place vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Place vertical straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "D" within the allowed space boundaries and comply with the gravity rules.
