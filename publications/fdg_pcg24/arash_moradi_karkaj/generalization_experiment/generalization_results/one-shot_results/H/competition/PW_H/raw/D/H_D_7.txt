To generate the uppercase letter "D", we will need to use a combination of block types b31 and b13. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "D":

ab_drop('b13',1)  // Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',2)  // Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',4)  // Place the second vertical straight block at position 4

This sequence of commands will create a stable and accurate representation of the letter "D" within the allowed space boundaries.
