To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

These commands will create the letter "D" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and ensuring structural stability.
