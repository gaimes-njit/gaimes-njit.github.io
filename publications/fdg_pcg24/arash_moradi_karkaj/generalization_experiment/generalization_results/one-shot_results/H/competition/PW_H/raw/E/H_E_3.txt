To generate the uppercase letter "E" using the given block types, we need to follow the step-by-step instructions:

1. Start from the leftmost position (X=1).
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at X=1 and Y=2. (`ab_drop('b13', 1)`)
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at X=1 and Y=4. (`ab_drop('b13', 1)`)
4. Move to X=2 and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at Y=1. (`ab_drop('b31', 2)`)
5. Move to X=4 and place a vertical straight block (b13) at Y=2. (`ab_drop('b13', 4)`)
6. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at X=4 and Y=4. (`ab_drop('b13', 4)`)

The stream of commands to generate the letter "E" is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```
