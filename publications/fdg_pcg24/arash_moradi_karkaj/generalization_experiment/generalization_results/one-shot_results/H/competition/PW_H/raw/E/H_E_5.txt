To generate uppercase English letter "E", we can break it down into three parts: the vertical line in the middle, the horizontal line at the top, and the horizontal line at the bottom.

Here are the ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "E":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will construct an uppercase English letter "E" in the defined environment.
