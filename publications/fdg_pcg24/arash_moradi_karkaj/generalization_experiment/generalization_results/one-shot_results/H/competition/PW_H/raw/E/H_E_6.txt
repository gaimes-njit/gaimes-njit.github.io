To generate the letter "E", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',3)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "E" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and within the specified boundaries.
