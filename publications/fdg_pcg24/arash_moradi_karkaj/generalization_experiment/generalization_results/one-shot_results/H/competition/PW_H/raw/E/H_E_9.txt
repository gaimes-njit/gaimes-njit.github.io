To generate the uppercase letter "E" using the provided block types in the defined environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Place the first vertical straight block (b13) at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
2. Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at position 3: `ab_drop('b13', 3)`
3. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`
4. Place the third vertical straight block (b13) at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
5. Place the fourth vertical straight block (b13) at position 3: `ab_drop('b13', 3)`

The final set of commands to generate the letter "E" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Please make sure to execute these commands consecutively.
