To generate the uppercase English letter "F" using the ab_drop() command and the given block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Place the two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the grid to form the two vertical lines of the letter "F":
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

2. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle of the grid, aligning it with the top of the vertical lines, to form the horizontal line of the letter "F":
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

3. Place two more vertical straight blocks (b13) on top of the existing vertical lines, aligned with the top of the horizontal line, to complete the top part of the letter "F":
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

The final stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "F" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
