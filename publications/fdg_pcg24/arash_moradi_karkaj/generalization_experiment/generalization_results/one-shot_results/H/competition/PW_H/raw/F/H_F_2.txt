To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Explanation:

1. The first two ab_drop() commands place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width. This creates the vertical lines of the letter "F".

2. The third ab_drop() command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width. This creates the horizontal line of the letter "F".

3. The last two ab_drop() commands place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width. This adds the final vertical lines to complete the letter "F".

By following these commands, the letter "F" will be accurately represented and fit within the allowed space boundaries.
