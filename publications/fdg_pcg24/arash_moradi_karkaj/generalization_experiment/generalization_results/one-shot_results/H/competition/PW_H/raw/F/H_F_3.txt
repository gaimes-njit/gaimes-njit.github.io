To generate the uppercase English letter "F" in the given environment, we will use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

Explanation:
- The first two commands (`ab_drop('b13',1)` and `ab_drop('b13',3)`) create the two vertical bars of the letter "F".
- The third command (`ab_drop('b31',2)`) creates the horizontal bar of the letter "F".
- The fourth and fifth commands (`ab_drop('b13',1)` and `ab_drop('b13',2)`) create the upper part of the horizontal bar to complete the letter "F".

Please note that these commands should be executed consecutively to construct the letter "F" accurately within the allowed space boundaries.
