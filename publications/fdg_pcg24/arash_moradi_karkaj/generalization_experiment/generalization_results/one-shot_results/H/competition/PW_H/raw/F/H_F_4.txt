To create the letter "F" using the provided block types in the given environment, you can follow the following sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 in the width.
2. Next, place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3 in the width.
3. Then, place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2 in the width.
4. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 in the width, above the previously placed blocks.
5. Finally, place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3 in the width, above the previously placed blocks.

This sequence of commands will result in the formation of the uppercase letter "F" within the specified boundaries and gravity rules.
