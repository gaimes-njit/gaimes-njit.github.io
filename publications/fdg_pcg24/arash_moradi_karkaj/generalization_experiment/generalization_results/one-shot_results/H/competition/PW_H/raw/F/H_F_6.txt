To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # place vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # place horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # place vertical straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "F" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
