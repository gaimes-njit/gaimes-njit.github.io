To create the letter "F" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width. This will form the foundation of the letter.  Use the ab_drop() command to place each block in the correct position.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Next, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width. This will form the middle part of the letter.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Finally, place two more vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width. This will complete the top part of the letter.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the letter "F" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
