To create the uppercase letter "F" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width to form the vertical lines of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

2. Next, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width to connect the two vertical lines in the middle:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

3. Finally, add two more vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width to complete the top part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

The complete set of commands to generate the uppercase letter "F" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```
