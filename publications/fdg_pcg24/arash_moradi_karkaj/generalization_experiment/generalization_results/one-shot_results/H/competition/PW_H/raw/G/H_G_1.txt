To generate the uppercase letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing the foundation of the letter "G" using two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width. This will create the vertical portion of the letter.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Next, we need to add the horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle of the letter, at position 2 along the width. This will create the horizontal portion of the letter.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Finally, we can add two more vertical straight blocks (b13) on top of the existing blocks, again at positions 1 and 3 along the width. This will complete the letter "G".

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the letter "G" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
