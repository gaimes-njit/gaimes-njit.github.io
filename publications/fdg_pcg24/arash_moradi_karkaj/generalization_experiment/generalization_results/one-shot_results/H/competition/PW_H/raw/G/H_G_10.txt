To generate the uppercase letter "G" in the given environment using the mentioned block types, the following stream of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing a vertical straight block at position 1 to form the vertical line of the letter "G" - `ab_drop('b13',1)`.
2. Next, place a horizontal straight block at position 2 to form the top part of the letter "G" - `ab_drop('b31',2)`.
3. Place another vertical straight block at position 4 to complete the vertical line of the letter "G" - `ab_drop('b13',4)`.
4. Add another vertical straight block at position 5 to complete the bottom part of the letter "G" - `ab_drop('b13',5)`.
5. Finally, add three 1x1 square blocks at positions 1, 2, and 3 to form the circular part of the letter "G" - `ab_drop('b11',1)`, `ab_drop('b11',2)`, `ab_drop('b11',3)`.

The resulting shape of the blocks will resemble the uppercase letter "G".
