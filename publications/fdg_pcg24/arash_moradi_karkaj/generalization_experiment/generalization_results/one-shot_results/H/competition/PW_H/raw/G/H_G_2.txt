To generate the capital letter "G" using the given command and block types, we need to carefully place the blocks in a way that resembles the shape of the letter. Here is a set of ab_drop() commands that will construct the letter "G" within the defined environment:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to create the top horizontal stroke of the "G".
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to create the vertical stroke of the "G".
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 4 to create the right side of the top loop of the "G".
4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4 to close the top loop of the "G".
5. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4 to create the right side of the bottom loop of the "G".
6. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to create the bottom horizontal stroke of the "G".
7. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 to continue the bottom horizontal stroke of the "G".
8. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4 to complete the bottom horizontal stroke of the "G".
9. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4 to close the bottom loop of the "G".

By following these commands, the blocks will stack and create the uppercase English letter "G" within the allowed space boundaries.
