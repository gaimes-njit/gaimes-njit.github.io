To construct the uppercase letter "G" in the given environment, we need to place the blocks in a specific sequence. Here are the ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "G":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)   # Place a square block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 5)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 6)   # Place a square block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 6)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 7)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Place a square block at position 10
ab_drop('b11', 11)  # Place a square block at position 11
ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 11
ab_drop('b11', 12)  # Place a square block at position 12
ab_drop('b31', 12)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 12
ab_drop('b31', 13)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 13
ab_drop('b13', 13)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 13
ab_drop('b11', 14)  # Place a square block at position 14
ab_drop('b11', 15)  # Place a square block at position 15
```

By executing these commands consecutively, we will be able to construct the uppercase letter "G" while maintaining stability according to the given gravity rules.
