To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Create the foundation of the letter by stacking two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Add the upper part of the letter by stacking a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the foundation blocks:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Complete the letter by stacking two vertical straight blocks (b13) on top of the upper part:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "G" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
