Here is a stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "H" using the given block types in the defined environment:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

The first two commands `ab_drop('b13',1)` and `ab_drop('b13',3)` create the foundation of the letter "H" by placing two vertical straight blocks with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units.

The third command `ab_drop('b31',2)` places a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit in the middle to form the crossbar of the letter "H".

Finally, the last two commands `ab_drop('b13',1)` and `ab_drop('b13',3)` place two more vertical straight blocks on top of the crossbar to complete the letter "H".

This sequence of commands ensures that the blocks are placed consecutively and structurally stable according to the gravity rules in the defined environment.
