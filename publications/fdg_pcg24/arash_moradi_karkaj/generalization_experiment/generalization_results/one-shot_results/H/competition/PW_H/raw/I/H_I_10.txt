To generate the uppercase English letter "I", you will need to use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

This sequence will create a vertical straight block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units, resembling the letter "I". Remember to start constructing the shapes from the X position 1.
