To generate the uppercase letter "I" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) in the first and last columns of the grid:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) in the second column to connect the two vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Finally, place two more vertical straight blocks (b13) in the first and last columns to complete the letter "I":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```

The complete sequence of commands to generate the uppercase letter "I" is:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 19)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```
