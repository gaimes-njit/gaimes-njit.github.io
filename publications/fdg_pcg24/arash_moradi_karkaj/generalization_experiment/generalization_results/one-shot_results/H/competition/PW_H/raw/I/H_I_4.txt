To generate the uppercase English letter "I", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1.
- Then, we place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2.
- Finally, we place the last vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3.

This arrangement will form the letter "I" in the Tetris-like environment.
