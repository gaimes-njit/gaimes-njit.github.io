To generate the uppercase letter "I" using the provided block types and environment, you would need to use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place vertical straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "I" within the defined environment while maintaining stacking and stability according to the gravity rules.
