To create the uppercase letter "I" using the given block types, you can follow these commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place another vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place a horizontal block at position 2
```

These commands will construct the letter "I" within the allowed space boundaries, following the gravity rules.
