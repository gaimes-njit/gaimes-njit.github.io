To generate the uppercase English letter "I", follow these steps:

1. Start by placing the vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
2. Place the vertical straight block (b13) at position 3, right next to the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
3. To complete the letter "I", place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, in between the two vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "I" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
