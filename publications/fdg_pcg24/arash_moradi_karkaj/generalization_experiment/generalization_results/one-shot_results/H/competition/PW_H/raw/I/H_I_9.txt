To generate the uppercase English letter "I", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1.
- The second command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1, just below the first block.
- Repeat this process for a total of 5 blocks to create the letter "I".

Ensure that you follow the gravity rules and avoid exceeding the height boundary of the grid.
