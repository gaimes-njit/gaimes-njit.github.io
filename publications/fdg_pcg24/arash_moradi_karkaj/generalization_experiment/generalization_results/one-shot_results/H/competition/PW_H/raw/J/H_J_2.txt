To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we will need to place the blocks in the following order:

1. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2.
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 3.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

5. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 3.
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 3)
   ```

After executing these commands consecutively, the blocks should form the uppercase English letter "J" within the defined environment.
