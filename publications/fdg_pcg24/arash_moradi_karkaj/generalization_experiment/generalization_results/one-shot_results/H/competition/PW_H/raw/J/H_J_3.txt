To generate the uppercase letter "J", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

5. Place the final vertical straight block (b13) at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

The complete set of commands to generate the uppercase letter "J" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)

```
