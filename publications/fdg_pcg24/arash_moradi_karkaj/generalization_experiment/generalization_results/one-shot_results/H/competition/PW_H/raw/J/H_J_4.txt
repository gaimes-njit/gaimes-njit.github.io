To create the uppercase English letter "J", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)           # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)           # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 3)           # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)           # Place the horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 4)           # Place the vertical straight block at position 4
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "J" in the Tetris-like environment while ensuring stacking and stability.
