To generate the uppercase English letter "J" using the ab_drop() command and block types in the defined environment, the following commands should be used:

``` Python
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place square block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "J" in the specified environment, with blocks arranged to resemble the letter accurately while maintaining structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
