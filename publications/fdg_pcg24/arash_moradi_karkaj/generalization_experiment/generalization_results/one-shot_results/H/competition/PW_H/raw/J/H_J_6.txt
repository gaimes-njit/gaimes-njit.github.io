To generate the uppercase English letter "J", you can use the following stream of commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first three commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)`, `ab_drop('b13', 2)`, `ab_drop('b13', 3)` create the vertical part of the letter "J" using three blocks of type `b13`.
- The last command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` creates the horizontal part of the letter "J" using a block of type `b31`. It is positioned in the middle of the vertical part.

Make sure to follow the gravity rules and start constructing the shapes from the X position 1.
