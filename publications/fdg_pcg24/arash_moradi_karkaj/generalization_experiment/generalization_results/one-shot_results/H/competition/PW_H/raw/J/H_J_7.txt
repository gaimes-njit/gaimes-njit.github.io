To generate the uppercase letter "J", we can follow the following steps:

1. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to create the vertical stem of the letter J.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to create the top bar of the letter J.
3. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 3 to complete the hook of the letter J.

The stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter J would be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```
