To generate the uppercase letter "J" using the given command and block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1 along the width. This will form the lower part of the letter "J". Use the command `ab_drop('b13', 1)`.

2. Place another vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 3 along the width. This will complete the lower part of the letter "J". Use the command `ab_drop('b13', 3)`.

3. To form the curved part of the letter "J", place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 2 along the width. This will be placed above the lower part of the letter. Use the command `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.

4. Finally, complete the upper part of the letter "J" by placing two vertical straight blocks (`b13`) at positions 1 and 3 along the width. Use the commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)` and `ab_drop('b13', 3)`.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "J":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
