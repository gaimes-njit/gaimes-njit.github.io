To construct the uppercase letter "J", we can follow the following steps:

1. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width, right below the previous block: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width, right below the previous block: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`
4. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width, right below the previous block: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
5. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width, right below the previous block: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`

The final stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "J" is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
