To create the uppercase letter "K", we can break it down into three parts: the left vertical line, the diagonal line, and the right vertical line.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop commands to create the letter "K":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical line on the left
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical line on the left
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the diagonal line
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the third vertical line on the right
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the fourth vertical line on the right
```

By following these commands, the blocks will be placed in the specified positions to form the uppercase letter "K".
