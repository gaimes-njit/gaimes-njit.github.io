To create the uppercase letter "K" in the Tetris-like environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the left vertical block (b13) in positions (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) to form the left vertical line of the letter "K".
2. Place the horizontal block (b31) in positions (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) to form the top horizontal line of the letter "K".
3. Place the right vertical block (b13) in positions (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3) to form the right vertical line of the letter "K".

Here are the commands to create the letter "K":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Please note that the commands should be executed sequentially, one after another.
