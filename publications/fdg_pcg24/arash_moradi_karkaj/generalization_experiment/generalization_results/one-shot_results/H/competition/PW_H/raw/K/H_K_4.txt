To create the capital letter "K", we need to stack and place the blocks in the following order:

1. Place the first vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Place the third vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

5. Place the fourth vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

So, the complete stream of commands to create the capital letter "K" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
