To create the letter "K" using the given block types and environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the first vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
2. Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at position 3.
3. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These commands will create the letter "K" in the specified environment while ensuring stability and adherence to the gravity rules.
