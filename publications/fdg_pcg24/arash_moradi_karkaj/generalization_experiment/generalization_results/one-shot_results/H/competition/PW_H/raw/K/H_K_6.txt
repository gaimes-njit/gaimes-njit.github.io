To generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can use the following stream of commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',4)   # Place vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',4)   # Place horizontal straight block at position 4
```

This series of commands will create a stable and accurate representation of the letter "K" within the allowed space boundaries.
