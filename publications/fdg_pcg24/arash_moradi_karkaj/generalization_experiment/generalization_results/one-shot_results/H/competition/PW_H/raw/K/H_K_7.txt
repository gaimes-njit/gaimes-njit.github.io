To generate the uppercase letter "K" using the given block types, we can break it down into three parts: the left vertical stroke, the diagonal stroke, and the right vertical stroke.

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "K":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the left vertical stroke
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place the diagonal stroke
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Continue the diagonal stroke
ab_drop('b31', 3)  // Complete the diagonal stroke
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the right vertical stroke
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

By following these commands, the blocks will be placed in the correct positions to form the uppercase letter "K" within the allowed space boundaries.
