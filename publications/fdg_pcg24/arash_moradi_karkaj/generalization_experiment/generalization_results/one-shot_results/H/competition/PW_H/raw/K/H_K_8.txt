To generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the first vertical straight block on the left side
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal straight block on top of the vertical block
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place another horizontal straight block next to the first one
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place the second vertical straight block on the right side
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place the third vertical straight block on the right side
```

This will create the letter "K" within the allowed space boundaries.
