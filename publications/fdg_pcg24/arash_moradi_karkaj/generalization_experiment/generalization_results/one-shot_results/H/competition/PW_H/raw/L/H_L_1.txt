To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we can use the following stream of commands using the block types provided:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "L" within the allowed space boundaries and ensure structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
