To generate the uppercase letter "L", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)     # Place first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)     # Place vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',2)     # Place vertical block at position 2 to complete the L shape
```

This will create a stable L shape using the block types provided.
