To generate the uppercase letter "L", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

This will first create the vertical part of the "L" using three vertical straight blocks (b13) placed sequentially from left to right. Then, a horizontal straight block (b31) will be placed at the top-right corner to complete the shape.

Please note that the instructions assume the starting X position is 1, so all blocks will be placed accordingly.
