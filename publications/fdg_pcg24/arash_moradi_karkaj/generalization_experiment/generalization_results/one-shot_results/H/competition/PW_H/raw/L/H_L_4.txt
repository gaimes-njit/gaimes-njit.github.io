To generate the uppercase English letter "L", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
- First, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to form the base of the "L" shape.
- Then, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to form the vertical part of the "L" shape.
- Finally, place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 to complete the "L" shape.

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "L" in the defined environment.
