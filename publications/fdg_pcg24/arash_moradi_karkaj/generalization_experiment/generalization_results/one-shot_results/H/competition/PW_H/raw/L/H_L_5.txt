To generate the uppercase letter "L", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place four vertical straight blocks ('b13') at position 1 to create the vertical part of the letter "L".
- Then, we place three horizontal straight blocks ('b31') starting from position 4 to create the horizontal part of the letter "L".

This arrangement will generate the uppercase letter "L" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring stability according to the gravity rules.
