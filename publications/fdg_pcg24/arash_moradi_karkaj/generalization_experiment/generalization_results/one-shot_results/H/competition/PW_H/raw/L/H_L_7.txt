To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we can follow the following steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the grid to form the vertical part of the letter "L":
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) above the previously placed blocks to complete the horizontal part of the letter "L":
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "L" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Remember to execute the commands consecutively and ensure that the blocks are placed within the boundaries of the grid.
