To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place a vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place a vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place a vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place a horizontal block at position 4
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "L" by stacking and arranging the blocks according to the specified rules.
