To generate the uppercase English letter "M", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical straight block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the second vertical straight block on the right side
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the third vertical straight block on the right side
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place the fourth vertical straight block on the right side
```

Make sure to execute these commands consecutively in the order provided to construct the letter "M" accurately within the defined environment.
