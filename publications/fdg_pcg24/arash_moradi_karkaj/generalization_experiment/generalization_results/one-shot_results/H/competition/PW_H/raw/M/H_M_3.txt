To generate the uppercase letter "M", we will start by creating the two outer vertical lines and then filling the middle portion. Here are the ab_drop() commands to accomplish this:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Create the left vertical line of the 'M'
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Create the right vertical line of the 'M'
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Create the middle portion of the 'M'
```

By executing these commands one by one, the desired letter "M" will be constructed inside the allowed space.
