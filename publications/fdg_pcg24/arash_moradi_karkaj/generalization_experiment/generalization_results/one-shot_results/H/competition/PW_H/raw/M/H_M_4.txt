To generate the uppercase letter "M", we can break it down into three parts: the left slant, the middle slant, and the right slant. Here's how we can construct each part using the given block types:

1. Left slant:
- Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
- Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3.

2. Middle slant:
- Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2.

3. Right slant:
- Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
- Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3.

Putting it all together, here's the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "M":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```
