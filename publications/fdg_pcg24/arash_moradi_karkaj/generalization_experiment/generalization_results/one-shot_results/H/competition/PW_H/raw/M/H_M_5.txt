To generate the uppercase English letter "M" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the first vertical straight block (b13) at the leftmost position (x = 1) and with its bottom at the height boundary (y = 15).
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at position x = 3, right next to the first block, and also with its bottom at the height boundary.
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position x = 2, between the two vertical blocks, and also with its bottom at the height boundary.
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Place the third vertical straight block (b13) at position x = 1, right below the first vertical block, and with its bottom at the height boundary.
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

5. Place the fourth vertical straight block (b13) at position x = 3, right below the second vertical block, and with its bottom at the height boundary.
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

By following these steps, we can generate the uppercase English letter "M" using the provided block types.
