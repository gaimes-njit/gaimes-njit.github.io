To create the letter "M", we need to stack the blocks in a specific pattern to resemble the letter shape. Here's the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "M":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place single block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',4)   # Place horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b11',5)   # Place single block at position 5
ab_drop('b13',6)   # Place vertical block at position 6
ab_drop('b31',7)   # Place horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop('b11',8)   # Place single block at position 8
ab_drop('b31',9)   # Place horizontal block at position 9
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "M" within the allowed space boundaries and adhere to the stacking and stability rules.
