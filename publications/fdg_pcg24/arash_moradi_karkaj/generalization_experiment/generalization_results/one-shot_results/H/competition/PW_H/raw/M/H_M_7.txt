To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can break it down into three parts: the left side, the middle, and the right side.

1. Left Side:
To construct the left side of the "M", we can use two vertical straight blocks (b13). Place the first block at positions (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3), and the second block at positions (1,4), (1,5), and (1,6). This will create the slanted left side of the "M".

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

2. Middle:
To construct the middle of the "M", we can use a horizontal straight block (b31). Place the block at positions (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4). This will create the horizontal line in the middle of the "M".

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

3. Right Side:
To construct the right side of the "M", we can use two vertical straight blocks (b13) again. Place the first block at positions (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3), and the second block at positions (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6). This will create the slanted right side of the "M".

```
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',6)
```

Combining all three parts will give us the uppercase English letter "M".

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',6)
```
