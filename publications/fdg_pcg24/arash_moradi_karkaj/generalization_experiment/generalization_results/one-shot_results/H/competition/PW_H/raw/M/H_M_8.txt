To generate the uppercase letter "M", we need to follow the provided instructions and use the ab_drop() command to place the block types in the defined environment. Here is the stream of commands to construct the letter "M":

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width to create the left side of the letter "M".
- Then, we place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 to complete the left side.
- Next, we place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to create the middle part of the letter "M".
- After that, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, overlapping the middle part, to create the left-middle part of the letter "M".
- Finally, we place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 4, overlapping the middle part, to create the right-middle part of the letter "M".

By following these commands in order, we will successfully generate the uppercase letter "M" within the defined environment.
