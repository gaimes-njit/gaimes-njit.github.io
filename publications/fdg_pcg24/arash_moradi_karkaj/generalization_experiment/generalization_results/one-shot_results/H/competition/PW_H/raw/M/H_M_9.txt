To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can use a combination of the block types b13 and b31. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to construct the letter "M" using the ab_drop() command:

1. Start by creating the left vertical stroke of the "M" using the b13 block type:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

2. Move to the middle section of the "M" and create the horizontal stroke using the b31 block type:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

3. Finally, create the right vertical stroke of the "M" using the b13 block type:
```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

When executed in the specified environment, these commands will construct the uppercase English letter "M" while adhering to the stacking and stability rules.
