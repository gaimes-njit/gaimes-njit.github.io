To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width to form the two vertical lines of the letter "N":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width to connect the two vertical lines:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width again to complete the letter "N":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

The final sequence of commands to generate the letter "N" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
