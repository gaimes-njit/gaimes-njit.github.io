To generate the uppercase letter "N" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these steps:

Step 1:
Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width. This will form the foundational part of the letter "N".

Command:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Grid Status:
```
  b13    
  b13    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
```

Step 2:
Next, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width. This will form the middle part of the letter "N".

Command:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

Grid Status:
```
  b31    
  b13    
  b13    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
```

Step 3:
Finally, place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width, above the previous blocks. This will complete the upper part of the letter "N".

Command:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Grid Status:
```
  b31    
  b13    
  b13    
  b13    
  b13    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
```

After following these steps, you will have successfully generated the uppercase letter "N" within the allowed space boundaries and in accordance with the gravity rules.
