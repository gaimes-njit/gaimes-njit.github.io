To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can start by building the left side of the letter using the vertical straight block (b13). Then, we can add the middle part of the letter using the horizontal straight block (b31), and finally complete the letter by adding the right side using another vertical straight block (b13).

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "N":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the first vertical straight block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Place the second vertical straight block on the left side
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place the horizontal straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the third vertical straight block on the right side
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Place the fourth vertical straight block on the right side
```

After executing these commands, you should have successfully generated the uppercase English letter "N" in the Tetris-like environment.
