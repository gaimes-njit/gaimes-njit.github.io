To generate the uppercase letter "N" using the ab_drop() command and the given block types, here is the stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b13',7)
```

Explanation:
1. The first three commands (ab_drop('b13',1), ab_drop('b13',2), ab_drop('b13',3)) create the left side of the letter "N" by stacking three vertical blocks on top of each other.
2. The fourth command (ab_drop('b31',4)) creates the middle part of the letter "N" by stacking a horizontal block with a width of 3 units.
3. The last three commands (ab_drop('b13',5), ab_drop('b13',6), ab_drop('b13',7)) create the right side of the letter "N" by stacking three vertical blocks on top of each other.

Please note that the commands should be executed consecutively in the given order to create the desired letter "N".
