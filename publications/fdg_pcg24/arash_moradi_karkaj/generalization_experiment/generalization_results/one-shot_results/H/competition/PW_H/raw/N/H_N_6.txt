To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical blocks, one on top of the other, on the left side of the grid:
```python
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

2. Move to the right side of the grid and place a horizontal block to connect the two vertical blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

3. Finally, place two more vertical blocks on top of the horizontal block to complete the letter "N":
```python
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "N" would be:
```python
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
