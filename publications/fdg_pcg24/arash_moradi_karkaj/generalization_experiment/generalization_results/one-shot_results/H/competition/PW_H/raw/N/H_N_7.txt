To generate the uppercase English letter "N", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "N" using the block types provided and following the given rules. Each command places a block one by one, starting from the left side (X position 1) and stacking them vertically according to the 2D gravity rules.
