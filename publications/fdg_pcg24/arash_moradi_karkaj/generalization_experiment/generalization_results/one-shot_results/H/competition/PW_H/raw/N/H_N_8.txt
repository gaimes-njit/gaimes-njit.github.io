To generate the uppercase English letter "N" using the given command and block types, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Explanation:

- First, we drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to create the left side of the "N".
- Next, we drop a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to create the diagonal line of the "N".
- Then, we drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position 4 to continue the left side of the "N".
- After that, we drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 5 to complete the diagonal line of the "N".
- Finally, we drop a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 7 and 9 to create the right side of the "N".

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "N" within the defined environment and gravity rules.
