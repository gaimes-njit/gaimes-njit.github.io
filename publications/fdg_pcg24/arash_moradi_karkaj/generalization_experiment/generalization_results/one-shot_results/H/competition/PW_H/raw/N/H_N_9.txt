To generate the uppercase English letter "N" using the given block types and environment, we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase English letter "N" within the given environment while maintaining stacking and stability.
