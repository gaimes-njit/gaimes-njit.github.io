To generate the uppercase English letter "O", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at position 1 and 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Move to the middle and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Finally, place two more vertical straight blocks (b13) at position 1 and 3 along the width, just above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

The complete set of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "O" is as follows:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
