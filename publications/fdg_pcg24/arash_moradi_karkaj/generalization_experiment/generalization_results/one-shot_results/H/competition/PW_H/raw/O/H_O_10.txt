To generate the capital letter "O", we can follow these steps:

First, create the foundation of the "O" by stacking two vertical straight blocks (b13) on top of each other. Place the first block at position 1 and the second block at position 3.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Next, create the middle part of the "O" by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Finally, create the upper part of the "O" by stacking two vertical straight blocks (b13) on top of each other. Place the first block at position 1 and the second block at position 3.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the letter "O" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
