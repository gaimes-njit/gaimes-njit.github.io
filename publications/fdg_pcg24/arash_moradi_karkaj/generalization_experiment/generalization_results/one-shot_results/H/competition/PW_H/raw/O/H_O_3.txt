To generate the uppercase English letter "O" using the given block types and environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the left vertical straight block (b13) at positions (1, 3) and (1, 4):
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place the right vertical straight block (b13) at positions (3, 3) and (3, 4):
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Place the top horizontal straight block (b31) at position (2, 2):
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Place the bottom horizontal straight block (b31) at position (2, 5):
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These commands will create a stable letter "O" shape within the defined boundaries.
