To create the uppercase English letter "O", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4.
4. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.

This sequence of commands will create a stable and accurate representation of the uppercase letter "O" within the defined environment.
