To generate the uppercase English letter "O", you can use the following `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

This series of commands will construct the letter "O" by stacking the blocks in the correct order and position.
