To generate the letter "O", we can use a combination of block types b31 and b13. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the second vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the third horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place the third vertical block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place the fourth horizontal block at position 10
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Place the fourth vertical block at position 10
ab_drop('b31', 13)  # Place the fifth horizontal block at position 13
ab_drop('b13', 13)  # Place the fifth vertical block at position 13
ab_drop('b31', 16)  # Place the sixth horizontal block at position 16
ab_drop('b13', 16)  # Place the sixth vertical block at position 16
ab_drop('b31', 19)  # Place the seventh horizontal block at position 19
ab_drop('b13', 19)  # Place the seventh vertical block at position 19
```

By following these commands, the blocks will be stacked properly to form the letter "O" within the allowed space boundaries while maintaining stability with respect to the gravity rules.
