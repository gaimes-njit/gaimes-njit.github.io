To generate the uppercase letter "P", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the vertical block at position 3
```

These commands will construct the uppercase letter "P" using the block types and adhere to the gravity rules within the defined environment.
