To create the uppercase letter "P", follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) side by side at the left edge of the grid:
````
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
````

2. Next, place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks, centered between them:
````
ab_drop('b31', 2)
````

3. Finally, place two more vertical straight blocks on top of the horizontal block to form the upper half of the letter "P":
````
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
````
Here is the complete sequence of commands to generate the letter "P":
````
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
````
