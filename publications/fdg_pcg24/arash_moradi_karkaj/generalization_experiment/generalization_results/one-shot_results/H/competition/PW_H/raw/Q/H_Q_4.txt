To generate the uppercase English letter "Q", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

These commands will form the letter "Q" with the block types and positions specified. Ensure that the blocks are stacked and placed according to the gravity rules mentioned in the instructions.
