To generate the uppercase English letter "Q", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing the first vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width, creating the upper part of the "Q":
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Finally, place the first vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width, slightly overlapping with the block placed in step 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

5. Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 along the width, overlapping with the block placed in step 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "Q" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
