To generate the uppercase English letter "Q", we can use the following series of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # First horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # First vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Second vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Center square block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Third horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Fourth horizontal block at position 3
```

This series of commands will stack the blocks in the shape of an uppercase "Q" within the defined boundaries.
