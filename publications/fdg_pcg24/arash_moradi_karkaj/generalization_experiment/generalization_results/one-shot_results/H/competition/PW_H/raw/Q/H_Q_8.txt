To generate the uppercase letter "Q" using the mentioned block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side of the grid, one on top of the other:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

2. Move to the right and place a horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle of the grid:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ```

3. Move back to the left and place two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other, just like in step 1:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to generate the uppercase letter "Q" within the allowed space boundaries and maintaining structural stability according to the gravity rules.

Here is the complete stream of commands to generate the letter "Q":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
