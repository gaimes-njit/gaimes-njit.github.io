To construct the uppercase letter "Q", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 4
```

These commands will create the letter "Q" within the allowed space and adhere to the gravity rules.
