To generate the uppercase letter "R", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2.
3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3.
4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4.
5. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 5.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
```
