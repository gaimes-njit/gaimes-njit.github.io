To generate the letter "R" using the given block types, we can break it down into three parts: the left vertical stroke, the diagonal stroke, and the right vertical stroke. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place the left vertical stroke at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place the left vertical stroke at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)    # Place the left vertical stroke at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)    # Place the diagonal stroke at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)    # Place the right vertical stroke at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 6)    # Place the right vertical stroke at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 7)    # Place the right vertical stroke at position 7
```

When executed consecutively, these commands will stack the blocks in the shape of the letter "R" within the allowed space.
