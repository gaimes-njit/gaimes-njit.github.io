To generate the letter "R", we need to carefully place the blocks in the specified order to create the desired shape. Below are the ab_drop() commands to achieve this:

``` 
ab_drop('b31', 1)          # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)          # Place the first vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)          # Place the second vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)          # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 1)          # Place the square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 3)          # Place the square block at position 3
```

By following these commands, you will generate the uppercase English letter "R" in the given Tetris-like environment.
