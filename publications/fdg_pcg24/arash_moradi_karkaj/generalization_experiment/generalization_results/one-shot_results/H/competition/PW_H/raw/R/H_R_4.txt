To generate the uppercase letter "R", we need to stack and arrange the blocks in a specific way. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) side by side at positions 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
This creates the left vertical stroke of the letter "R".

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) across positions 1, 2, and 3, overlapping the top of the left vertical stroke:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```
This creates the top bar of the letter "R".

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3, overlapping the right end of the top bar:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This creates the right vertical stroke of the letter "R".

4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) across positions 2, 3, and 4, just below the top bar and overlapping the right vertical stroke:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
This creates the bottom bar of the letter "R".

The complete set of commands to generate the uppercase letter "R" is as follows:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Using these commands consecutively will generate the uppercase letter "R" within the defined 20x16 grid while ensuring stability with regard to the gravity rules.
