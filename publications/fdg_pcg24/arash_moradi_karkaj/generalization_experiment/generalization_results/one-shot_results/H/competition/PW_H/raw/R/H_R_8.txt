To construct the uppercase English letter "R", we need to use the block types mentioned in the instructions. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
```

These commands will create a stable and accurate representation of the letter "R" within the allowed space boundaries.
