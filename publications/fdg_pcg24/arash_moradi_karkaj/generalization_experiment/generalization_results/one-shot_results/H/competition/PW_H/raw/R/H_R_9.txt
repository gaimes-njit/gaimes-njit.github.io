To generate the uppercase English letter "R", we can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 to create the two vertical lines of the letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to connect the two vertical lines and form the top part of the letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 on top of the horizontal straight block to complete the letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "R" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
