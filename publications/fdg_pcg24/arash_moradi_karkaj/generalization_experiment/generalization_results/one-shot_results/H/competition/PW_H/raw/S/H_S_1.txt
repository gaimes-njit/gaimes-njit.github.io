To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we will use a combination of the block types b31 and b13. Here is the sequence of commands to create the letter:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

These commands will first create the bottom part of the letter "S" using a b31 block at position 1, followed by a b13 block at position 2. Then, it will build the middle part of the letter using a b31 block at position 4, followed by a b13 block at position 3. Finally, it will create the top part of the letter using a b31 block at position 2, followed by a b13 block at position 4, and a b31 block at position 1.

By following these commands, the blocks will stack on top of each other while respecting the gravity rules, resulting in the formation of the uppercase letter "S".
