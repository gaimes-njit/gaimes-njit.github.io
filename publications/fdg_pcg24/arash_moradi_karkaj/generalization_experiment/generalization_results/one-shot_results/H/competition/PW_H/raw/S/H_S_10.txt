To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the third vertical straight block at position 1
```

This sequence of commands will generate the letter "S" in the defined environment, with each block type placed in the correct order and position to resemble the letter.
