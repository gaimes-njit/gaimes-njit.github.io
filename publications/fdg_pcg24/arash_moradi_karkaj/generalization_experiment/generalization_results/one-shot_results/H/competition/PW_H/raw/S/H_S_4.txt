To generate the letter S, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width.
2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 along the width.
3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width.
4. Finally, place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width to complete the letter S.

The stream of commands to generate the letter S would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Please note that the commands should be executed consecutively and within the specified environment boundaries.
