To generate the uppercase letter "S", we can break it down into three parts: the top curve, the middle curve, and the bottom curve. 

Here is the stream of `ab_drop()` commands to generate the letter "S":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1 to form the top curve.
2. Place another horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 4 to continue the top curve.
3. Place a 1x1 square block (`b11`) at position 2 to create the middle part of the letter.
4. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 5 to start the bottom curve.
5. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1 to extend the bottom curve.
6. Place another horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 4 to complete the bottom curve.

By following these commands, you will be able to generate the uppercase letter "S" within the allowed space boundaries.
