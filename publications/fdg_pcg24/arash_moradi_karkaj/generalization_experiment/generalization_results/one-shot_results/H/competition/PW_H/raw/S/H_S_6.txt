To generate the uppercase English letter "S" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the bottom horizontal line of the letter "S" using two b13 blocks. Place the first b13 block at position 1 and the second b13 block at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Next, create the middle horizontal line of the letter "S" using a b31 block. Place the b31 block at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Finally, create the top horizontal line of the letter "S" using two b13 blocks. Place the first b13 block at position 1 and the second b13 block at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the uppercase English letter "S" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
