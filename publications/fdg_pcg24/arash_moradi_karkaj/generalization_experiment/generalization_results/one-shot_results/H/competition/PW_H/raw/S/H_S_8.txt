To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we can start by creating the bottom curve using two vertical straight blocks (b13) placed at positions 1 and 3. Then, we can create the top curve using a horizontal straight block (b31) placed at position 2. Here are the commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```
