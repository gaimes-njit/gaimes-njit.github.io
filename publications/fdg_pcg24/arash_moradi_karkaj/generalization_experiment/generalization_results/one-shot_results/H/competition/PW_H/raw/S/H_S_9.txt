To generate the uppercase letter "S" using the given block types and rules, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to create the left side of the "S" shape:
   ```ab_drop('b13', 1)```

2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 to complete the left side of the "S" shape:
   ```ab_drop('b13', 3)```

3. Move to the middle section of the "S" shape and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
   ```ab_drop('b31', 2)```

4. Finally, complete the upper section of the "S" shape by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3:
   ```ab_drop('b13', 1)```
   ```ab_drop('b13', 3)```

Overall, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "S" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
