To create the uppercase letter "T", we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to create the vertical stem of the letter. We'll use the vertical straight block (b13) for that. Place it at position 1 using the ab_drop('b13', 1) command.

ab_drop('b13', 1)

2. Next, we'll create the horizontal bar of the letter. We'll use the horizontal straight block (b31) for that. Place it at position 2 using the ab_drop('b31', 2) command.

ab_drop('b31', 2)

3. To complete the uppercase "T", we need to create the top of the letter. Again, we'll use the vertical straight block (b13) and place it at positions 1 and 3 using the ab_drop('b13', 1) and ab_drop('b13', 3) commands respectively.

ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)

Overall, the sequence of commands to generate the uppercase letter "T" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
