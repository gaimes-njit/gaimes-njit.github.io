To generate the uppercase letter "T" using the given block types and environment, you should follow these instructions:

1. Place the foundation of the "T" by using the vertical straight block (b13) twice, starting from the leftmost position:
```ab_drop('b13', 1)```
```ab_drop('b13', 3)```

2. Move up to the middle of the "T" by using the horizontal straight block (b31) in the second position:
```ab_drop('b31', 2)```

3. Complete the "T" by using the vertical straight block (b13) twice more, starting from the leftmost position:
```ab_drop('b13', 1)```
```ab_drop('b13', 3)```

The final stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "T" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
