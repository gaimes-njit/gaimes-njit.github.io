To generate the uppercase English letter "T", follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

2. Then, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

3. Finally, place two more vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width, on top of the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "T" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
