To generate the uppercase letter T using the given block types and commands, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 to the right of the first block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Now, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to connect the two vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Finally, place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 and 3 above the horizontal block to complete the letter T:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter T would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
