To create the uppercase letter "T" using the given block types and gravity rules, you can use the following sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Place the vertical block at position 3
```

These commands will build the letter "T" in the defined environment, following the rules of stacking and stability.
