To generate the uppercase letter "T" using the ab_drop() commands, follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

2. Then, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width, between the two vertical blocks:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

3. Finally, place two more vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width, above the horizontal block, to complete the letter "T":
```plaintext
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "T" would be:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```
