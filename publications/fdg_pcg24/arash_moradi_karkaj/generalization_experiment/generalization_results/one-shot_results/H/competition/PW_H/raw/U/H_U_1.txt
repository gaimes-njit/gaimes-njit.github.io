To generate the uppercase letter "U" using the mentioned block types, we need to follow the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place vertical straight block at position 3
```

Please note that each block type and its position are mentioned in the ab_drop() command.
