To generate the uppercase letter "U" using the ab_drop() command and the Block Types in the defined environment, we need to create three blocks:

1. The left vertical line of the "U":
   ab_drop('b13', 1) - Place a b13 block at position 1 along the width.

2. The right vertical line of the "U":
   ab_drop('b13', 3) - Place a b13 block at position 3 along the width.

3. The horizontal line connecting the left and right vertical lines of the "U":
   ab_drop('b31', 2) - Place a b31 block at position 2 along the width.

In summary, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "U" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
