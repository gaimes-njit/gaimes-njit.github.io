To generate the letter "U", we need to build a foundation, a middle section, and an upper section. Here's a stream of commands to achieve that:

```
Foundation:
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)

Middle:
ab_drop('b31', 2)

Upper:
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

By following these commands, you should be able to build the uppercase letter "U" in the specified environment while maintaining structural stability and adhering to the gravity rules.
