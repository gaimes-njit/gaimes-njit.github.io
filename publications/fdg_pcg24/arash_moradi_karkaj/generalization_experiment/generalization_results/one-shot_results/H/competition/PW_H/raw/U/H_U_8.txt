To generate the uppercase English letter "U", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

Explanation:
- The first two commands `ab_drop('b13',1)` and `ab_drop('b13',2)` place two vertical straight blocks at positions 1 and 2, creating the left side of the "U".
- The third command `ab_drop('b31',1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1, connecting the bottom of the left side to the bottom of the right side.
- The fourth command `ab_drop('b31',3)` places another horizontal straight block at position 3, completing the bottom of the "U".
- Finally, the last two commands `ab_drop('b13',1)` and `ab_drop('b13',2)` place two vertical straight blocks at positions 1 and 2, creating the right side of the "U".

By following these instructions, the uppercase English letter "U" will be accurately represented and fit within the allowed space boundaries.
