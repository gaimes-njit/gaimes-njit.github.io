To generate the uppercase English letter "U" in the given environment, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',5)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the third vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place the fourth vertical straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase English letter "U" within the allowed space and ensure its structural stability with the gravity rules.
