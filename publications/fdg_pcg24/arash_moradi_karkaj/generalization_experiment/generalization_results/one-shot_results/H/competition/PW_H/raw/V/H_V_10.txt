To generate the uppercase English letter "V", you can use the following stream of commands:

``` 
ab_drop('b13',1)             # Place first vertical straight block on position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)             # Place second vertical straight block on position 3
ab_drop('b31',2)             # Place horizontal straight block in the middle
```

By following these commands in sequence, you will be able to construct the letter "V" within the allowed space and gravity rules.
