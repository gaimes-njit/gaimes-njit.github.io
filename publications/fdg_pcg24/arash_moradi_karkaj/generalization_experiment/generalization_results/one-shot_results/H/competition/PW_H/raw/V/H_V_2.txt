To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we need to build a V-shaped structure using the block types mentioned earlier. Here is a sequence of ab_drop() commands that will create the letter "V":

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place the horizontal straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place the vertical straight block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place the vertical straight block on the right side
```

These commands will create a stable "V" shape within the allowed space boundaries.
