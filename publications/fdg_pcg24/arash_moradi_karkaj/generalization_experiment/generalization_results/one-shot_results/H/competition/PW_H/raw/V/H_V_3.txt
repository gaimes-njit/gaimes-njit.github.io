To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1) 
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This set of commands will construct a stable "V" shape using the block types and gravity rules specified in the environment.
