To generate the uppercase letter "V" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Build the left side of the letter "V":
  - Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
  - Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3.

2. Build the right side of the letter "V":
  - Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2.

By following these steps, we will have constructed the uppercase letter "V" using the given block types.

Here are the required ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```
