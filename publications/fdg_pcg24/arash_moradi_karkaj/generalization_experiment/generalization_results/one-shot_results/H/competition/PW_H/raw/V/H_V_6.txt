To create the uppercase letter "V" using the given block types in the defined environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the left side of the "V" using two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

2. Place the right side of the "V" using two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 4 and 5 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
```

3. Place the middle part of the "V" using a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "V" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
```
