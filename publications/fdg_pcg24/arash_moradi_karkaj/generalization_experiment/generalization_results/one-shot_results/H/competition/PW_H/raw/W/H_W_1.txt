To generate the uppercase letter "W", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```python
# First block of the "W"
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Second block of the "W"
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Third block of the "W"
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

This set of commands will construct the letter "W" within the defined environment, following the gravity rules.
