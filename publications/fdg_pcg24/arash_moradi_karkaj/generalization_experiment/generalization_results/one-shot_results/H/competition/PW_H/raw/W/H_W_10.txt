To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we can start by creating the left slant of the letter using block type b13:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place the second vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 5)   # Place the third vertical straight block at position 5
```

Next, we can create the middle section of the letter using block type b31:

```
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 4
```

Finally, we can create the right slant of the letter using block type b13:

```
ab_drop('b13', 7)   # Place the first vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 9)   # Place the second vertical straight block at position 9
ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Place the third vertical straight block at position 11
```

Together, these commands will generate the uppercase English letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries in the Tetris-like environment.
