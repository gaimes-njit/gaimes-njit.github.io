To generate the uppercase letter "W," we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "W" by stacking the blocks in the correct order and position within the allowed space.
