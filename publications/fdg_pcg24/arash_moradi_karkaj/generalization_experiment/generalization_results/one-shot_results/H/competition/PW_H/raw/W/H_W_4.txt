To generate the letter "W", we need to stack the blocks in the following pattern:

```
b13  b13
b31  b31
b13  b13
```

Here's the stream of commands to achieve that:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Make sure to input these commands consecutively between three backticks (```).
