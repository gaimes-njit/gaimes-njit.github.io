To generate the uppercase letter "W" using the given block types and commands, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing the first vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Move to the middle section of the letter and place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Move back to the upper section of the letter and place the first vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

5. Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "W" will look like this:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
