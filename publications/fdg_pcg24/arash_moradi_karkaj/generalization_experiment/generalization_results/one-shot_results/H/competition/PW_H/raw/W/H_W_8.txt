To generate the uppercase letter "W", we need to place the blocks in a specific pattern that resembles the letter. The following stream of commands will create the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 13)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 16)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing three vertical straight blocks ('b13') consecutively at positions 1, 3, and 5.
2. Continue by placing three vertical straight blocks ('b13') consecutively at positions 7, 9, and 11.
3. Now, place two horizontal straight blocks ('b31') at positions 4 and 8 to create the middle part of the letter.
4. Place two horizontal straight blocks ('b31') at positions 12 and 16 to complete the middle part.
5. Finally, place one horizontal straight block ('b31') at positions 2 and 6 to create the top part of the letter.
6. Complete the letter by placing a square block ('b11') at position 10 to form the center peak.

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively and pay attention to the positioning of each block to accurately represent the letter "W".
