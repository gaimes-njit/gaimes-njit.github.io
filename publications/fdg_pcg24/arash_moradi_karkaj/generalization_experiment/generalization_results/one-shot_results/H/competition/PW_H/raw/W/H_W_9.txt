To generate the uppercase letter "W", we can break it down into three parts: the two vertical straight blocks on the sides, and the horizontal straight block in the middle.

Here's how you can generate the letter "W" using the ab_drop() command:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the left vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place the horizontal straight block in the middle at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 4)  // Place the right vertical straight block at position 4
```

By following these commands, you will be able to create the uppercase letter "W" in the Tetris-like environment.
