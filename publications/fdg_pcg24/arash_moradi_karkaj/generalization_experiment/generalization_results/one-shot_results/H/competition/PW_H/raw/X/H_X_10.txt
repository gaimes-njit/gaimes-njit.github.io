To generate the uppercase letter "X", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. First, we place the bottom-left vertical straight block at position 1.
2. Then, we place the bottom-right vertical straight block at position 3.
3. Next, we place the horizontal straight block in the middle at position 2.
4. After that, we place the top-left vertical straight block again at position 1.
5. Finally, we place the top-right vertical straight block again at position 3.

By following these commands, we can accurately represent and fit the uppercase letter "X" within the allowed space boundaries.
