To generate the letter "X" using the ab_drop() command and the given block types, you can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing the vertical straight block (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width to form the two diagonal lines of the letter "X":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Next, place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to connect the two diagonal lines:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Finally, reinforce the structure of the letter "X" by placing the vertical straight block (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width again:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

After following these steps in order, you will have successfully generated the uppercase English letter "X" within the allowed space boundaries and with the required structural stability.
