To generate the uppercase English letter "X", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at the bottom of the grid:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This forms the two outer stems of the letter "X".

2. Move one step higher and place a horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle of the two vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
This forms the middle horizontal line of the letter "X".

3. Move one step higher again and repeat steps 1 and 2 to complete the upper part of the letter "X":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
These blocks align with the previously placed vertical and horizontal blocks to form the upper part of the letter "X".

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "X" is:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
