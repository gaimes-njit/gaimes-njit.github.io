To generate the uppercase English letter "X", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the left diagonal of the "X". Use the b13 block type to create a vertical straight block with a width of 1 and a height of 3. Place it at position 1 along the width. Use the ab_drop('b13', 1) command.

2. Create the right diagonal of the "X". Use the b13 block type again and place it at position 3 along the width. Use the ab_drop('b13', 3) command.

3. Create the middle horizontal part of the "X". Use the b31 block type to create a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 and a height of 1. Place it at position 2 along the width. Use the ab_drop('b31', 2) command.

The complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "X" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Executing these commands consecutively will create the letter "X" within the defined environment.
