To create the uppercase letter "X" using the mentioned command and block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width, and at any suitable height. For example:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 along the width, keeping the same height. For example:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

3. Move to the middle section of the letter. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width, at an appropriate height. For example:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

4. Finally, return to the upper section of the letter. Repeat step 1 and 2 to place two more vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width, and at an appropriate height. For example:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

By following these steps, you will be able to create the uppercase letter "X".
