To generate the uppercase letter "X", we can start by creating the two diagonal lines that form the letter. We will use the b31 block type for this.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "X":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the first diagonal line starting from the left
ab_drop('b31',5)  # Place the second diagonal line starting from the right
```

After executing these commands, you should have a stable structure that resembles the letter "X" within the allowed space boundaries.
