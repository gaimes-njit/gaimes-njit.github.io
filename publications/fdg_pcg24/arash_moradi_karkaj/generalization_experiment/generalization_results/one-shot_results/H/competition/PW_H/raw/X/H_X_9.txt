To generate the uppercase English letter "X", we can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) side by side at the bottom of the grid. This forms the two legs of the "X":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle of the grid, slightly above the previous placement. This forms the middle line of the "X":
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Finally, place two vertical straight blocks (b13) side by side at the top of the grid, aligned with the previous placement. This forms the top part of the "X":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Overall, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "X" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
