To generate the uppercase letter "Y", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Next, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Finally, place two more vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "Y" is as follows:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
