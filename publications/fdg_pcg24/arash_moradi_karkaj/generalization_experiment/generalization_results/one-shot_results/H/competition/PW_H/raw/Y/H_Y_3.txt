To generate the uppercase letter "Y", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by creating the left vertical stem of the letter. Use the ab_drop('b13', 1) command to place a vertical straight block at position 1.
2. Create the right vertical stem of the letter. Use the ab_drop('b13', 3) command to place a vertical straight block at position 3.
3. Create the diagonal middle part of the letter. Use the ab_drop('b31', 2) command to place a horizontal straight block at position 2, connecting the two vertical stems.

Here is the complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "Y":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Executing these commands will construct the letter "Y" within the specified boundaries and gravity rules.
