To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1) ab_drop('b13', 3)      # Create the left vertical segment
ab_drop('b31', 2)                        # Create the horizontal segment
ab_drop('b13', 1) ab_drop('b13', 3)      # Create the right vertical segment
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "Y" within the allowed space and maintain stability according to the gravity rules.
