To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", we can use the following stream of commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Explanation:
- First, we start by placing three vertical straight blocks (b13) in a row at positions 1, 2, and 3. This forms the left side of the letter "Y".
- Then, we place three horizontal straight blocks (b31) in a row at position 2. This forms the middle part of the letter "Y".
- Finally, we place three vertical straight blocks (b13) in a row at positions 1, 2, and 3. This forms the right side of the letter "Y".
