To create the uppercase letter "Y", we will need to stack and position the blocks in a specific way. Here is the stream of commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal block on top of the vertical block, at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place a square block next to the horizontal block, at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the second vertical block next to the square block, at position 3
```

This series of commands will create a stable structure that resembles the uppercase letter "Y" within the boundaries of the allowed space.
