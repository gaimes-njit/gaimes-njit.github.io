To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to form the left side of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 to form the right side of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to connect the two vertical blocks and form the middle of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. The shape of the letter "Z" is now complete.
