To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the square block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "Z" with the given block types and in the defined environment.
