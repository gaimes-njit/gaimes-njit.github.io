To generate the uppercase English letter "Z" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place the first vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place the second horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 5)   # Place the second vertical block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place the third horizontal block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "Z" in the Tetris-like environment, ensuring stacking and stability.
