To generate the uppercase English letter "Z" using the given block types and environment, the following stream of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width to create the left side of the "Z" shape.
- Next, we place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to create the diagonal line of the "Z" shape.
- Then, we place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 to complete the right side of the "Z" shape.
- To add stability and prevent the blocks from falling, we place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, slightly above the horizontal straight block.
- Finally, we place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3, above the last vertical straight block, to connect the diagonal line.

By following these commands, we can generate the uppercase English letter "Z" in the given environment while ensuring structural stability and adhering to the gravity rules.
