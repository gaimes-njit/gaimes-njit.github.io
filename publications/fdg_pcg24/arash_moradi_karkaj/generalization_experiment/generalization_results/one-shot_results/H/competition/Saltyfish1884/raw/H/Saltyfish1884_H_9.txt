To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully determine the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Determine the dropping position for the b13 block (vertical block) that forms the central part of the "H" character. We need to drop this block at the center slot (y = 9) and on the solid base (layer 0 or on top of b11 or b13 blocks). We can achieve this by using the ab_drop() function as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

This will drop the b13 block at the center slot and on the solid base.

2. Determine the dropping position for the b31 block (horizontal block) that forms the upper part of the "H" character. We need to drop this block on top of the b13 block to form the upper part. We can achieve this by using the ab_drop() function as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

This will drop the b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with the center slot.

3. Determine the dropping position for the second b13 block (vertical block) that forms the lower part of the "H" character. We need to drop this block on the solid base and on either side of the b31 block. We can achieve this by using the ab_drop() function twice, once for each side, as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Dropping on the left side of the b31 block
ab_drop('b13', 12)  # Dropping on the right side of the b31 block
```

This will drop the b13 blocks on the solid base, aligned with the respective slots.

4. Determine the dropping position for the b11 blocks (square blocks) that form the edges of the "H" character. We need to drop these blocks on the solid base, adjacent to the b13 blocks. We can achieve this by using the ab_drop() function twice, once for each side, as follows:

```
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Dropping on the left side
ab_drop('b11', 13)  # Dropping on the right side
```

This will drop the b11 blocks on the solid base, aligned with the respective slots.

5. After executing these steps, the structure variable will contain the grid representation of the "H" character. You can print the structure to see the final result.

```
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This will print the final structure that resembles the character "H".

Note: This is just an example of how to generate a structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all hard constraints. The specific dropping positions and order may vary based on the exact requirements and constraints of the problem.
