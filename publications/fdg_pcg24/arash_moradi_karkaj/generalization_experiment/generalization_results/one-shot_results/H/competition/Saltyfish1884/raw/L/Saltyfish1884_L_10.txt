To generate a stable structure resembling the character "L" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by placing a b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. We can achieve this by using the ab_drop() function with the appropriate arguments:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```
This will drop a b31 block with its center aligned to slot 8.

3. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block to create the vertical part of the "L" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```
This will drop a b11 block with its center aligned to slot 8.

4. Place another b11 block next to the previously dropped b11 block to form the horizontal part of the "L" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
This will drop a b11 block with its center aligned to slot 9.

5. Finally, add stability to the structure by placing a b11 block below the b31 block:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```
This will drop a b11 block with its center aligned to slot 8.

After following these steps, the generated structure should resemble the character "L" and meet all the hard constraints.
