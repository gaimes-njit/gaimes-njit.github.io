To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base of the structure by dropping a b11 block at the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
```

3. Drop a b31 block on top of the base to create the flat bottom of the "S" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

4. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block but shifted one slot to the right:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 + 1)
```

5. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block but shifted two slots to the left:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 2)
```

6. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block but shifted one slot to the right:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 1)
```

7. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block but shifted two slots to the left:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 4)
```

8. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block but shifted one slot to the right:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 3)
```

9. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block but shifted two slots to the left:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 6)
```

10. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block but shifted one slot to the right:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 5)
```

11. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block but shifted two slots to the left:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 8)
```

12. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block but shifted one slot to the right:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 7)
```

13. Drop a b13 block on top of the previous block to complete the top part of the "S" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2 - 6)
```

After following these steps, the structure will resemble the character "S" while meeting all hard constraints. You can visualize the final structure by printing the elements of the `structure` grid.
