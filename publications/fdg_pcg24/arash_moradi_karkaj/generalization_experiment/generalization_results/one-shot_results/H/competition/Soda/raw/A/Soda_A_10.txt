To generate the structure of the letter "A" in the level, we need to carefully place the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability and similarity.

Step 1: Place the base of the letter "A"
We can start by placing a row block (b31) at the center of the grid, ensuring that it is balanced and stable. Let's place it at x_position=9.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Step 2: Place the top of the letter "A"
Next, we need to place the top part of the letter "A" above the base. We can do this by stacking two column blocks (b13) on top of each other, slightly offset to the right. 
Let's place the first column block at x_position=8 and the second column block at x_position=10.

ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

The complete implementation to generate the structure of the letter "A" is as follows:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

Please note that this implementation assumes that the grid is empty before starting the placement of blocks. If there are existing blocks in the level, their positions and types should be taken into account for stability and similarity.
