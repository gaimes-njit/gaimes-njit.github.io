Based on the requirement to generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "E" in the Tetris game, we can follow the given hints to create a stable and similar structure. 

To create the letter "E" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can start by placing the bottom bar horizontally at the bottom of the grid. Then, we can place the middle pipe vertically on the right side of the bottom bar. Finally, we can place the top bar horizontally on top of the middle pipe.

Here is the complete implementation to generate the "E" structure:

```
#ab_drop(bottom bar)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

#ab_drop(middle pipe)
ab_drop("b13", 11)

#ab_drop(top bar)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```

In the implementation above, the `ab_drop()` function is used to drop the blocks in the specified positions. The first parameter of the `ab_drop()` function indicates the block type, and the second parameter represents the x-position where the block should be centered.

This implementation creates the "E" structure in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability and similarity to the target character.
