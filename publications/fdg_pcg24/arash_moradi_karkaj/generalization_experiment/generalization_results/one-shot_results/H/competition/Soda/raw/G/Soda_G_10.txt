To generate a structure that looks like the capital character "G", we will break down the letter into different blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.

1. Drop the base block of size 1 * 3 at the bottom center of the grid:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

2. Drop the upright bar of size 1 * 3 on top of the base block:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

3. Drop the horizontal bar of size 3 * 1 on top of the upright bar:
ab_drop("b31", 7)

4. Drop the top-right bar of size 1 * 3 on top of the horizontal bar:
ab_drop("b13", 11)

5. Drop the top-left bar of size 1 * 3 on top of the horizontal bar:
ab_drop("b13", 5)

6. Drop the upper-right diagonal bar of size 1 * 3 on top of the top-right bar:
ab_drop("b13", 11)

7. Drop the upper-left diagonal bar of size 1 * 3 on top of the top-left bar:
ab_drop("b13", 5)
