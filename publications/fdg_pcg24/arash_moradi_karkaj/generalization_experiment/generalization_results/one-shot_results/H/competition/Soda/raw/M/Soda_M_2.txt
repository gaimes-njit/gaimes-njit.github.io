To create a capital "M" shape in the Tetris game, we need to carefully stack the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. Here is a step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the base blocks of the "M" shape. We will use the "b31" block type for this.
```
ab_drop("b31", 6)   # Place the leftmost vertical block
ab_drop("b31", 8)   # Place the rightmost vertical block
```

Step 2: Place the top middle block of the "M" shape. We will use the "b11" block type for this.
```
ab_drop("b11", 7)   # Place the top middle block
```

Step 3: Place the top side blocks of the "M" shape. We will use the "b13" block type for this.
```
ab_drop("b13", 5)   # Place the left side block
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Place the right side block
```

Complete implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 6)   # Place the leftmost vertical block
ab_drop("b11", 7)   # Place the top middle block
ab_drop("b31", 8)   # Place the rightmost vertical block
ab_drop("b13", 5)   # Place the left side block
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Place the right side block
```
