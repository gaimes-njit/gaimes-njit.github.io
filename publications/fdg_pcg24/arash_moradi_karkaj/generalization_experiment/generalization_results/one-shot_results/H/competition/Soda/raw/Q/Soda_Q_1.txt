To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "Q", we can break it down into three blocks: a square block, a column block, and a row block. 

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the square block at the bottom left corner of the grid:
```
ab_drop("b11", 0)
```

2. Place the column block on top of the square block at the center of the grid:
```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

3. Place the row block on top of the column block at the center of the grid:
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

By following these steps, we can create a structure that resembles the capital letter "Q" in both stability and similarity.
