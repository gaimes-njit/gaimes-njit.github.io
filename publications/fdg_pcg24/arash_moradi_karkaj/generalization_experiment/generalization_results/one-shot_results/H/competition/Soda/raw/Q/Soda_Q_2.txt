To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "Q" using the ab_drop() function, we can break down the shape into smaller blocks and stack them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the base block (the circle part of the "Q") at position 9:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

2. Drop the vertical bar of the "Q" at position 10, and 3 rows above the base block:
ab_drop("b31", 10)

3. Drop the horizontal bar of the "Q" at position 9, and 4 rows above the base block:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
