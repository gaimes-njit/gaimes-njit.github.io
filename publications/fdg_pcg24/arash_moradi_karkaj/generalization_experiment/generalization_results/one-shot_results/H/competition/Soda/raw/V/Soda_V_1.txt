To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "V" (TARGET) using the ab_drop() function, we can follow the bottom-to-top approach. Here's a step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the base blocks of the "V" shape.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the first block horizontally in the middle
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Place the second block vertically to the left of the first block
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Place the third block vertically to the right of the first block
```

Step 2: Place the upper blocks of the "V" shape.
```python
ab_drop("b11", 7)  # Place the first upper block to the left of the second block
ab_drop("b11", 11)  # Place the second upper block to the right of the third block
```

Step 3: Fine-tune the structure for better stability (optional, based on evaluation).

Complete Implementation:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```

This implementation will generate a structure resembling the capital letter "V" (TARGET) in a stable manner. Note that the positions chosen in the ab_drop() calls ensure that the blocks are placed within the level's boundaries and follow the bottom-to-top approach.
