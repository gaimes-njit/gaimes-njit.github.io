To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital "Y", we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the top horizontal bar of the "Y"
ab_drop("b31", 10)

Step 2: Place the bottom horizontal bar of the "Y"
ab_drop("b31", 10)

Step 3: Place the vertical bar of the "Y"
ab_drop("b13", 10)

Complete Implementation:
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
