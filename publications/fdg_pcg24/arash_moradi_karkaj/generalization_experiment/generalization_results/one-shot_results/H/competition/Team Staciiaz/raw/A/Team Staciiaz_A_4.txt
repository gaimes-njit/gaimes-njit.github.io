To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "A" and meets all the constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code: 
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in the desired positions, taking into consideration the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

3. Determine the dropping positions and order using techniques in the block-stacking problem. A possible approach is to start with the base block (b31) at the bottom center of the grid.

4. Drop the first block (b31) at slot 9 on layer 0 using the `ab_drop()` function: 
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will create the base of the structure.

5. Next, drop two blocks (b11) on top of the base block at slots 8 and 10 on layer 1:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
This will create the middle part of the character "A".

6. Finally, drop the top block (b11) at slot 9 on layer 2:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
This will complete the structure and create the character "A".

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "A" while satisfying all the constraints.
