To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "E" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a careful and strategic manner. Here is how we can approach it:

1. Start with an empty structure initialized using the provided code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the vertical block `b13` at slot 8 using `ab_drop('b13', 8)`. This will create the left vertical line of the "E" character.

3. Drop the horizontal block `b31` at slot 9 using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`. This will create the horizontal line of the "E" character.

4. Drop the square block `b11` at slot 10 using `ab_drop('b11', 10)`. This will create the middle of the "E" character.

5. Drop another vertical block `b13` at slot 11 using `ab_drop('b13', 11)`. This will create the right vertical line of the "E" character.

By following these steps, we will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "E" and satisfies the stability constraint. Additionally, we have ensured that the blocks do not intrude on the boundary of the map, meeting the no boundary intrusion constraint.

Note: The order and exact positions of block drops may vary slightly depending on the specific implementation of the `ab_drop()` function and its internal weight distribution calculations.
