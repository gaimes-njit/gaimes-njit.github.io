To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and meets all the constraints, we can use a combination of the ab_drop() function and careful placement of blocks.

First, we need to determine the appropriate dropping position and order of blocks to create the desired shape. Since stability is crucial, we should start by placing blocks at the bottom layers and gradually build upwards.

Here is a step-by-step process to generate the desired structure:

1. Start by initializing the structure grid:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Begin by dropping a b13 block at slots 2 to 4 (centered at slot 3) in the bottom layer:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
The structure will look like this:
```
     x        
     x        
x    x        
```

3. Next, drop a b31 block at slots 1 to 3 (centered at slot 2) in the layer above the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
The structure will look like this:
```
     x        
xx   xx       
x    x        
```

4. Drop another b13 block at slots 4 to 6 (centered at slot 5) in the same layer as the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
The structure will look like this:
```
     x        
xx   xx  x    
x    x        
```

5. Place a b31 block at slots 0 to 2 (centered at slot 1) in the layer above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
The structure will look like this:
```
   xxx        
xx xx xx  x    
x    x        
```

6. Drop a b13 block at slots 6 to 8 (centered at slot 7) in the same layer as the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```
The structure will look like this:
```
   xxx        
xx xx xx xx   
x    x        
```

7. Finally, place a b31 block at slots 0 to 2 (centered at slot 1) in the layer above the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
The final structure will look like this:
```
   xxx        
xx xx xx xx   
xx   x        
```

The resulting structure will be a stable "F" shape that meets all the constraints. Note that the structure does not intrude on the boundary of the map, satisfying the no boundary intrusion constraint.
