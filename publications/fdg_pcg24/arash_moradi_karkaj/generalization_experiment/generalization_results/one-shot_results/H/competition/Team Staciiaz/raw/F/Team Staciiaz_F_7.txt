To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a sequential manner while satisfying the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is one possible solution:

```python
# Step 1: Drop the base block
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Step 2: Drop the vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Step 3: Drop the horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

Explanation:
- In Step 1, we drop the base block ('b31') at the center slot (9) to create a stable foundation for the "F" structure.
- In Step 2, we drop the vertical block ('b13') aligned with the center slot (9) on top of the base block to form the vertical stroke of the "F".
- In Step 3, we drop the horizontal block ('b31') aligned with the leftmost slot (6) above the vertical stroke to complete the horizontal stroke of the "F".

This solution satisfies the stability constraint by stacking blocks from the base upwards and the boundary intrusion constraint as the blocks are not intruding on the boundary of the map.

Please note that there may be multiple valid solutions to construct the "F" structure while meeting the given constraints.
