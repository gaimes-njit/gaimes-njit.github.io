To meet the stability constraint and avoid boundary intrusion, we can follow these steps to generate a stable structure in the shape of the character "G" using the `ab_drop()` function:

1. Place the base block `b11` at slot 4, centered vertically in the bottom layer (layer 0).
   - `ab_drop('b11', 4)`

2. Place the vertical block `b13` at slot 4, centered vertically in the second layer (layer 1).
   - `ab_drop('b13', 4)`

3. Place the horizontal block `b31` at slot 4, aligned with the top of the vertical block in layer 1.
   - `ab_drop('b31', 4)`

4. Place the horizontal block `b31` at slot 7, aligned with the left side of the previous horizontal block in layer 1.
   - `ab_drop('b31', 7)`

5. Place the horizontal block `b31` at slot 10, aligned with the left side of the previous horizontal block in layer 1.
   - `ab_drop('b31', 10)`

6. Place the vertical block `b13` at slot 12, aligned with the right side of the previous horizontal block in layer 1.
   - `ab_drop('b13', 12)`

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure in the shape of the character "G" while satisfying the stability constraint and avoiding boundary intrusion.
