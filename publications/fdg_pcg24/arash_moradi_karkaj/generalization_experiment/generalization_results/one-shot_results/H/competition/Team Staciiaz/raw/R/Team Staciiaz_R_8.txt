To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "R", we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop blocks and meet all the constraints. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. First, we need to drop the base block (b31) to create a stable foundation. We can drop it at the center slot (slot 10) on layer 0 (the bottom layer). This will ensure stability and no boundary intrusion.

```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

2. Next, we can drop the vertical block (b13) on top of the base block to form the vertical stroke of the "R". We can drop it at the center slot (slot 10) on layer 3.

```
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

3. To create the curved part of the "R", we can drop another vertical block (b13) one slot to the left (slot 9) and one layer higher (layer 4). This will create the upper part of the curve.

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Finally, to complete the "R", we can drop two horizontal blocks (b31) on top of the vertical blocks. We can drop them at slots 7 and 11 on layer 5. This will form the crossbar of the "R".

```
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "R" and satisfies all the given constraints.
