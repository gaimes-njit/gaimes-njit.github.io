To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "U" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to place the blocks in a strategic manner. Here's an approach to accomplish this:

1. Drop the first block of type 'b31' at slot 0, centered at the bottom layer.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

2. Drop the next block of type 'b31' at slot 18, centered at the bottom layer.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 18)
```

3. Drop the third block of type 'b13' at slot 0, centered at the second layer from the bottom.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Drop the fourth block of type 'b13' at slot 18, centered at the second layer from the bottom.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 18)
```

By following these steps, the `ab_drop()` function will drop the blocks in a sequential manner, ensuring stability and satisfying the constraints. The resulting structure will resemble the character "U" and will not intrude on the map boundaries.

Note: The `ab_drop()` function will handle the placement and stability automatically, as it calculates the position to drop the block based on the current structure.
