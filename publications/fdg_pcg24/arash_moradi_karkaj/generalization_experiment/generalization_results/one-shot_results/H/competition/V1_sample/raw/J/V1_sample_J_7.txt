To create a stable structure that looks like the letter "J" using the `ab drop()` function, follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a b13 block (vertical block) from layer H at slot 10.
2. Next, drop a b31 block (horizontal block) from layer H-3 at slot 10.
3. Finally, drop a b11 block (square block) from layer H-6 at slot 10.

Make sure to adjust the drop positions and order to ensure stability and achieve the desired shape. Experiment with different positions and block types to fine-tune the structure.
