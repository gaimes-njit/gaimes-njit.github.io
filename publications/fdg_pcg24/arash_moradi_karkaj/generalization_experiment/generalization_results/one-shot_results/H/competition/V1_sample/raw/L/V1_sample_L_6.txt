To create a stable structure resembling the "L" shape using the ab drop() function, follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a b13 block at layer 15 with its center at slot 4.
2. Next, drop a b13 block at layer 14 with its center at slot 4.
3. Drop a b31 block at layer 13 with its center at slot 4.
4. Finally, drop a b11 block at layer 13 with its center at slot 6.

By following these steps and carefully selecting the positions and order of the blocks dropped using the ab drop() function, you can create a stable structure that looks like the letter "L" on the map.
