1. The letter "V" with asterisks can be drawn as follows:

```
*       *
 *     * 
  *   *
   * *
    *
```

2. Line-by-line, the asterisks and spaces generated in each row of the drawing are:

```
Row 1: 1 asterisk, 7 spaces
Row 2: 2 asterisks, 5 spaces
Row 3: 3 asterisks, 3 spaces
Row 4: 4 asterisks, 1 space
Row 5: 5 asterisks
```

3. Using `x` to represent asterisks and `y` to represent spaces, the pattern becomes:

```
Row 1: 1x, 7y
Row 2: 2x, 5y
Row 3: 3x, 3y
Row 4: 4x, 1y
Row 5: 5x
```

4. Listing the variables side-by-side:

```
Row 1: x-1; y-7
Row 2: x-2; y-5
Row 3: x-3; y-3
Row 4: x-4; y-1
Row 5: x-5
```

5. Listing the variables with their positions:

```
Row 1: x-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; y-5; y-6; y-7
Row 2: x-1; x-2; x-3; y-4; y-5; y-6
Row 3: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; y-5; y-6
Row 4: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; y-5; y-6; y-7
Row 5: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
```

6. The sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
