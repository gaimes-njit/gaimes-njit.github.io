To create a stable structure resembling "D" while adhering to the given constraints, the following `ab_drop()` calls can be used:

```python
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop b31 to create the vertical line of "D"
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Drop b13 to create the vertical line of "D"
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Drop b31 and b13 to create the diagonal line of "D"
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Drop b11 to create the horizontal line of "D"
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

This will generate a stable structure resembling the letter "D" with the blocks aligned correctly.
