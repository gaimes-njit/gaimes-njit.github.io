Here is a possible solution to construct the "S" structure:

```python
# Define the map size
W = 20
H = 16

# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the first block horizontally (b31)
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# Drop the second block vertically (b13)
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Drop the third block horizontally (b31)
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Drop the fourth block vertically (b13)
ab_drop('b13', 3)

# Drop the fifth block horizontally (b13)
ab_drop('b13', 4)

# Drop the sixth block vertically (b31)
ab_drop('b31', 5)

# Drop the seventh block horizontally (b31)
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Drop the eighth block vertically (b13)
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Drop the ninth block horizontally (b31)
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Drop the tenth block vertically (b31)
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the eleventh block horizontally (b13)
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Drop the twelfth block vertically (b31)
ab_drop('b31', 11)

# Drop the thirteenth block horizontally (b31)
ab_drop('b31', 12)

# Drop the fourteenth block vertically (b13)
ab_drop('b13', 13)

# Drop the fifteenth block horizontally (b13)
ab_drop('b13', 14)

# Drop the sixteenth block vertically (b31)
ab_drop('b31', 15)
```

Note: The specific positioning and rotation of the blocks may vary depending on the desired shape and orientation of the "S" structure. The provided solution is just one possible arrangement that satisfies the given constraints.
