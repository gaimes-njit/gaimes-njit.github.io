To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "C" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, the following steps can be followed:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided `structure` variable.

2. Drop the b13 block to form the vertical part of the "C" shape. To do this, call `ab_drop('b13', 1)` to drop the block at slot 1.

3. Drop the b31 block to form the top arc of the "C" shape. To do this, call `ab_drop('b31', 4)` to drop the block at slot 4.

4. Drop the b31 block to form the bottom arc of the "C" shape. To do this, call `ab_drop('b31', 4)` to drop the block at slot 4.

5. The structure should now resemble the uppercase character "C" with the blocks properly stacked and stable.

6. Make stability checks before each call to `ab_drop()` to ensure that the structure remains stable and does not collapse.

Alternatively, the stability check can be incorporated into the `ab_drop()` function itself by modifying the function to include stability checks before dropping the block. This will ensure that the entire structure remains stable throughout the generation process.
