To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "C", we can follow the given constraints and use the `ab_drop()` function effectively. Here's a step-by-step process:

1. Initialize the structure:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Create the base of the structure:
```
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop('b11', i)
```
This will create a stable row of b11 blocks at the bottom layer of the structure.

3. Build the vertical part of the "C":
```
for i in range(3):
    ab_drop('b13', 1)
    ab_drop('b13', W - 2)
```
This will create two vertical columns of b13 blocks at the second layer from the bottom.

4. Build the horizontal part of the "C":
```
for i in range(3, W-3):
    ab_drop('b31', i)
```
This will create a horizontal row of b31 blocks at the third layer from the bottom.

5. Add stability support for the horizontal part:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', W - 3)
```
These two b13 blocks will provide support for the horizontal row of b31 blocks.

With these steps, the structure will resemble the uppercase character "C" and satisfy the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. Additionally, the position and order of the block drops have been determined using techniques in the block-stacking problem.

Remember to perform stability checks before each `ab_drop()` call to ensure the entire structure remains stable throughout the generation process.
