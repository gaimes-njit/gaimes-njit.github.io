To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "M," we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the given code snippet.

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at slot 9. This block will serve as the middle part of the "M." Use the ab_drop() function to drop the block and update the structure grid accordingly.

3. Next, drop two b11 blocks diagonally above the b31 block, at slots 8 and 10. These two blocks will serve as the top parts of the "M." Again, use the ab_drop() function to drop the blocks and update the structure grid.

4. To create the bottom parts of the "M," drop two b13 blocks on each side of the b31 block, at slots 6 and 12. These blocks will provide stability to the structure. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the blocks and update the structure grid.

5. Finally, drop two b11 blocks diagonally below the b31 block, at slots 7 and 11. These blocks will complete the bottom parts of the "M" and add symmetry. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the blocks and update the structure grid.

The resulting structure will resemble the uppercase character "M." Repeat the process to generate different variations of the structure.

Example code:

```python
def generate_M_structure():
    # Initialize the structure grid
    structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
    
    # Drop the middle part of the "M"
    ab_drop('b31', 9)

    # Drop the top parts of the "M"
    ab_drop('b11', 8)
    ab_drop('b11', 10)

    # Drop the bottom parts of the "M"
    ab_drop('b13', 6)
    ab_drop('b13', 12)

    # Drop the bottom diagonal blocks
    ab_drop('b11', 7)
    ab_drop('b11', 11)
    
    return structure

# Generate the M structure
structure = generate_M_structure()

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Note: This is just one possible approach to generate the "M" structure. There may be other valid solutions that meet the constraints.
