To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "M" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Create an empty structure grid using the provided map initialization:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Define a helper function to check the stability of the structure after dropping a block:
   ```python
   def is_stable():
       for i in range(H-1):
           for j in range(W):
               if structure[i][j] != ' ' and structure[i+1][j] == ' ':
                   return False
       return True
   ```

3. Initialize variables for the previous and current block types:
   ```python
   previous_block = ''
   current_block = ''
   ```

4. Loop through all the layers from the bottom to the top:
   ```python
   for layer in range(H):
       if layer % 2 == 0:
           current_block = 'b31'
       else:
           current_block = 'b13'
   ```

5. Determine the slot number to drop the block in, based on the previous and current block types:
   ```python
       if previous_block == 'b31':
           slot = 10  # Align the b13 block with the center of the previous b31 block
       else:
           slot = 4  # Align the b31 block with the center of the previous b13 block
   ```

6. Drop the block using the `ab_drop()` function:
   ```python
       ab_drop(current_block, slot)
   ```

7. Check the stability of the structure after dropping the block, and if it's not stable, adjust the slot number until it is:
   ```python
       while not is_stable():
           slot += 1
           ab_drop(current_block, slot)
   ```

8. Update the previous block type:
   ```python
       previous_block = current_block
   ```

9. Repeat steps 4-8 for all layers.

10. Finally, the structure will resemble the uppercase character "M" and meet all the hard constraints.

Note: The specific slot and block types used in the algorithm may need to be adjusted based on the desired shape of the "M".
