To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "O" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Create a helper function `check_stability()` to check the stability of the structure by iterating through each layer and slot. This function will return True if the structure is stable and False otherwise. The stability can be determined based on the presence of a block below the current position.
```python
def check_stability():
    for layer in range(1, H):
        for slot in range(W):
            if structure[layer][slot] != ' ' and structure[layer-1][slot] == ' ':
                return False
    return True
```

3. Start building the structure by calling `ab_drop()` in a loop until the entire structure is built. In each iteration, choose a block type randomly from b11, b13, and b31 and a slot randomly from 1 to W-2 to avoid boundary intrusion. Check the stability of the structure before each drop to ensure stability.
```python
import random

while not check_stability():
    x = random.choice(['b11', 'b13', 'b31'])
    y = random.randint(1, W-2)
    ab_drop(x, y)
```

4. After the structure is built, check if it resembles the uppercase character "O" by comparing the structure to the expected pattern. The expected pattern for the letter "O" can be defined as a 2D list. If the structure matches the pattern, the goal is met. Otherwise, repeat the steps to generate a new structure.

5. Ensure diversity in the generated structures by introducing variations in the block selection and slot selection while maintaining stability.

Here is a complete example of generating a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "O" using the given `ab_drop()` function and following the steps above:

```python
def check_stability():
    for layer in range(1, H):
        for slot in range(W):
            if structure[layer][slot] != ' ' and structure[layer-1][slot] == ' ':
                return False
    return True

import random

def generate_structure():
    structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
    
    while not check_stability():
        x = random.choice(['b11', 'b13', 'b31'])
        y = random.randint(1, W-2)
        ab_drop(x, y)
    
    expected_pattern = [
        [' ', 'b31', 'b31', 'b31', ' '],
        ['b13', 'b11', 'b11', 'b11', 'b13'],
        ['b13', 'b11', '   ', 'b11', 'b13'],
        ['b13', 'b11', 'b11', 'b11', 'b13'],
        [' ', 'b31', 'b31', 'b31', ' ']
    ]
    
    if structure == expected_pattern:
        return structure
    else:
        return generate_structure()

final_structure = generate_structure()
```

Note that this is just one example of how to generate a stable structure resembling the uppercase character "O". Depending on the desired complexity and diversity, you can modify the selection of block types and slots, as well as the expected pattern, to achieve the desired results.
