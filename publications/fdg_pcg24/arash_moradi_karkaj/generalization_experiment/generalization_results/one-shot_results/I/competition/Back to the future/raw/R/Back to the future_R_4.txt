To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "R" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop each block in the appropriate position. Here is a step-by-step guide to constructing the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` variable:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first vertical block (b13) at slot 5 using the `ab_drop()` function. This block will serve as the left leg of the "R". The drop coordinates are (15, 5).

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

3. Drop the second vertical block (b13) at slot 5, but at a higher layer than the first block. This block will serve as the right leg of the "R". The drop coordinates are (12, 5).

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

4. Drop the horizontal block (b31) at slots 3, 4, and 5, with the center aligned to slot 2. This block will serve as the top bar of the "R". The drop coordinates are (9, 2), (9, 3), and (9, 4).

```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

5. Drop the small square block (b11) at slot 3, aligned with the bottom of the right leg. This block will serve as the connection between the right leg and the top bar of the "R". The drop coordinates are (11, 3).

```python
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

6. Drop the small square block (b11) at slot 2, above the previous block. This block will serve as the top right corner of the "R". The drop coordinates are (10, 2).

```python
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

7. Drop the small square block (b11) at slot 4, aligned with the bottom of the left leg. This block will serve as the connection between the left leg and the top bar of the "R". The drop coordinates are (11, 4).

```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

8. Drop the small square block (b11) at slot 2, above the previous block. This block will serve as the top left corner of the "R". The drop coordinates are (10, 4).

```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

9. Output the final structure using the `structure` variable.

```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This sequence of block drops will generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "R". The stability of the structure is ensured by the dropping order and position, as well as the support provided by the lower blocks. Additionally, the structure meets the hard constraints and is similar to the desired character.
