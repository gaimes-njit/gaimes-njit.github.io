To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "S" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided map initialization code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the drop positions for each block type to create the desired shape of the letter "S". 

- Drop b11 blocks at the bottom left and bottom right corners of the structure to create stability:
```
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 17)
```

- Drop b31 blocks at the upper right and upper middle sections of the structure, with support below them:
```
ab_drop('b31', 19)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 18)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

- Drop b13 blocks at the bottom middle and upper left sections of the structure, with support below them:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Perform stability checks before each call to `ab_drop()`.

The resulting structure should resemble the uppercase letter "S" and meet all the hard constraints.
