To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase "T" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to strategically place the blocks b11, b13, and b31 to form the desired shape while satisfying the hard constraints. The following steps outline a possible approach:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided map initialization code.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base support for the b31 horizontal block. This support is necessary to ensure stability.
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Coordinate (15, 9)
```

3. Drop the b31 block on top of the base support.
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Coordinate (14, 9)
```

4. Place supports for the b13 vertical blocks. These supports provide stability for the vertical blocks.
```
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Coordinate (13, 8)
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Coordinate (13, 10)
```

5. Drop the b13 blocks on top of the supports.
```
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Coordinate (12, 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Coordinate (12, 10)
```

6. Place the top support for the b31 horizontal block.
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Coordinate (11, 9)
```

7. Drop the final b31 block on top of the supports to complete the structure.
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Coordinate (10, 9)
```

After following these steps, the structure will resemble the uppercase letter "T" and satisfy the hard constraints of stability and boundary intrusion.
