To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "W" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic order. Here is a possible solution:

1. Start by dropping a b31 block in the center slot (y = 10) to create the middle part of the "W". Call `ab_drop('b31', 10)`.

2. Next, drop a b13 block in the left slot (y = 4) to create the left part of the "W". Call `ab_drop('b13', 4)`.

3. Drop another b13 block in the right slot (y = 16) to create the right part of the "W". Call `ab_drop('b13', 16)`.

4. Now, drop a b11 block in the center slot (y = 10) on top of the b31 block to create the middle part of the top layer of the "W". Call `ab_drop('b11', 10)`.

5. Drop a b11 block in the left slot (y = 4) on top of the left b13 block to create the left part of the top layer of the "W". Call `ab_drop('b11', 4)`.

6. Drop another b11 block in the right slot (y = 16) on top of the right b13 block to create the right part of the top layer of the "W". Call `ab_drop('b11', 16)`.

7. Finally, drop a b11 block in the center slot (y = 10) on top of the middle b11 block to complete the top layer of the "W". Call `ab_drop('b11', 10)`.

This sequence of block drops will result in a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "W". Note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid arrangements that meet the constraints.
