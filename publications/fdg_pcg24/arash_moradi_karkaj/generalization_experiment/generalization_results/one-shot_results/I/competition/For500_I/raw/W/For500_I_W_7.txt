The code to generate a stable structure resembling the letter "W" using the `ab_drop()` function is as follows:

ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b13', 7)

Explanation:
- The first `ab_drop('b13', 9)` drops a vertical block (b13) at horizontal index 9, placing it in the center bottom position of the structure.
- The second `ab_drop('b13', 9)` drops another vertical block (b13) at horizontal index 9, stacking it on top of the previous block, creating the middle part of the "W" shape.
- The third `ab_drop('b31', 10)` drops a horizontal block (b31) at horizontal index 10, placing it above the previous two blocks. This forms the top part of the middle line of the "W" shape.
- The fourth `ab_drop('b13', 8)` drops a vertical block (b13) at horizontal index 8, stacking it on top of the middle block on the left side. This forms the left bottom part of the "W" shape.
- The fifth `ab_drop('b31', 12)` drops another horizontal block (b31) at horizontal index 12, placing it above the previous blocks. This forms the top part of the right line of the "W" shape.
- The sixth `ab_drop('b13', 7)` drops a vertical block (b13) at horizontal index 7, stacking it on top of the left bottom block. This forms the left top part of the "W" shape.

The resulting structure resembles the capital English letter "W" and is stable according to the constraints given.
