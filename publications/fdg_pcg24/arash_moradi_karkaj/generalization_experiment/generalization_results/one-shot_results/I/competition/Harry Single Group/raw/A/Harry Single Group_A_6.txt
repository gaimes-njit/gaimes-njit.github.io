To form the shape resembling the letter "A" using the given bricks, we can divide the process into multiple steps:

Step 1: Place the b13 brick vertically to form the left side of the "A" shape.
ab_drop('b13', 5)

Step 2: Place the b11 brick to form the middle line of the "A" shape.
ab_drop('b11', 7)

Step 3: Place the b13 brick vertically to form the right side of the "A" shape.
ab_drop('b13', 11)

Make sure to separate the analysis code with the actual code that calls the ab_drop function. Here is the complete code:

```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Implementation of ab_drop function goes here
    pass

# Map initialization
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Step 1: Place the b13 brick vertically to form the left side of the "A" shape
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Step 2: Place the b11 brick to form the middle line of the "A" shape
ab_drop('b11', 7)

# Step 3: Place the b13 brick vertically to form the right side of the "A" shape
ab_drop('b13', 11)

# Print the resulting field
for row in field:
    print(row)
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the ab_drop function is missing and should be added to the code. The function should handle the dropping of bricks, checking for occupied cells, and updating the field accordingly.
