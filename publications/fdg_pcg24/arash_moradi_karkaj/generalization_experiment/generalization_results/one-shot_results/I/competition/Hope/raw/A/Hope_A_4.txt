To create the structure "A", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop commands:

1. ab_drop('b13', 1) - drop a 1x3 block at position (1,0)
2. ab_drop('b13', 1) - drop a 1x3 block at position (1,1)
3. ab_drop('b11', 0) - drop a 1x1 block at position (0,3)
4. ab_drop('b13', 2) - drop a 1x3 block at position (2,1)
5. ab_drop('b13', 2) - drop a 1x3 block at position (2,2)
6. ab_drop('b31', 1) - drop a 3x1 block at position (1,4)
7. ab_drop('b31', 1) - drop a 3x1 block at position (1,5)

This will create the structure "A" inside a 20x16 box, where the position (0,0) is the top-left corner of the box.
