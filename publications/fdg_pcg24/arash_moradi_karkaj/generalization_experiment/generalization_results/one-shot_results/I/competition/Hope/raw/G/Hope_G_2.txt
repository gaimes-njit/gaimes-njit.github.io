To create the structure "G" inside a 20*16 box, we can use the following ab_drop commands:

1. Start by placing the top horizontal line of the "G":

ab_drop('b31', 1)

This will place a 3*1 block starting at position (1,0).

2. Next, place the vertical line of the "G":

ab_drop('b13', 4)

This will place a 1*3 block starting at position (4,0).

3. Finally, place the bottom horizontal line of the "G":

ab_drop('b31', 1)

This will place another 3*1 block starting at position (1,2).

The structure will now look like the letter "G" inside the 20*16 box.
