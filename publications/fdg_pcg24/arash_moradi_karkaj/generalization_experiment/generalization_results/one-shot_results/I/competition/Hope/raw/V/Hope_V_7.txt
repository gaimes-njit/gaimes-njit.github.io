To create the structure exactly like "V" inside a 20x16 box, you can use the following commands:

Step 1: Place the first block (b11) at position (0, 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)

Step 2: Place the second block (b13) at position (2, 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)

Step 3: Place the third block (b13) at position (4, 0)
ab_drop('b13', 4)

Step 4: Place the fourth block (b31) at position (6, 0)
ab_drop('b31', 6)

Step 5: Place the fifth block (b31) at position (14, 0)
ab_drop('b31', 14)

Step 6: Place the sixth block (b13) at position (16, 0)
ab_drop('b13', 16)

Step 7: Place the seventh block (b13) at position (18, 0)
ab_drop('b13', 18)

This will create a structure resembling the letter "V" inside the 20x16 box.
