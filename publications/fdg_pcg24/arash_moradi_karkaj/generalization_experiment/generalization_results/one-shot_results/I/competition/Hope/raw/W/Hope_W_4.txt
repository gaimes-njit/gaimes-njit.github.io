To create the structure "W" inside a 20*16 box, we can use the following commands:

1. Place the first two vertical lines of the "W" using b31 blocks:
    - ab_drop('b31', 2) (for the left side of the "W")
    - ab_drop('b31', 7) (for the right side of the "W")
    
2. Place the top and bottom horizontal lines of the "W" using b13 blocks:
    - ab_drop('b13', 2) (for the top line)
    - ab_drop('b13', 5) (for the bottom line)
    - ab_drop('b13', 7) (for the top line)
    - ab_drop('b13', 10) (for the bottom line)

After executing these commands, you should have a "W" structure inside the 20*16 box.
