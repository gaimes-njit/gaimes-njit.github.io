To generate the letter "Y", the following ab_drop() commands can be used:

ab_drop('b13', 1) // Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2) // Place the second vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3) // Place the third vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2) // Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
