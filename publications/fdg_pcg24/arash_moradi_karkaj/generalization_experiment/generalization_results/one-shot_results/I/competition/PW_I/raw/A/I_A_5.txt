To generate the uppercase letter "A", the following blocks need to be placed:

1. Place a b31 block at position 1.
2. Place a b31 block at position 3.
3. Place a b13 block at position 2.
4. Place a b13 block at position 2.

The correct sequence of commands using the ab_drop() function is:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
