To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') starting at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') starting at position 2.
3. Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') starting at position 3.
4. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') starting at position 1.
5. Place one more vertical straight block ('b13') starting at position 3.

This sequence of commands will create a stable representation of the uppercase letter "A" within the allowed space boundaries in the Tetris-like environment.
