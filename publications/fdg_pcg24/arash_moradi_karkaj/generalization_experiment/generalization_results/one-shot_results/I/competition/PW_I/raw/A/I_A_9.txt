To generate the uppercase letter "A", we will need to use a combination of block types to create the desired shape. Here is one possible sequence of ab_drop() commands that will generate the letter "A":

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)    # Place a single square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)    # Place another square block next to the previous one
ab_drop('b11', 3)    # Place a third square block next to the previous two
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place a horizontal straight block on top of the first row
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place a vertical straight block to form the left side of the "A"
ab_drop('b13', 3)    # Place another vertical straight block to form the right side of the "A"
```

This sequence of commands will create the desired shape of the uppercase letter "A" within the allowed space and following the gravity rules.
