To generate the uppercase English letter "B", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1 along the width
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1 along the width
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2 along the width
ab_drop('b11',2)  # Place the square block at position 2 along the width
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3 along the width
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 3 along the width
ab_drop('b31',4)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 4 along the width
```

These commands will generate the uppercase English letter "B" in the defined environment.
