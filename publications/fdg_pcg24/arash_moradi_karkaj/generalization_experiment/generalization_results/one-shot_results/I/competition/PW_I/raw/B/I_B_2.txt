To generate the letter "B", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',5)
```

Explanation:

- The first command places a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 along the width.
- The second command places a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 along the width.
- The third command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 along the width.
- The fourth command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3 along the width.
- The fifth command places another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3 along the width.
- The sixth command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3 along the width.
- The seventh command places another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 5 along the width.

This sequence of commands will create a stacked and stable representation of the letter "B" within the allowed space boundaries.
