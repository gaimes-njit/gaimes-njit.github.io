To generate the uppercase letter "B", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 1
```

By following these commands, the blocks will stack and align to form the uppercase letter "B" within the allowed space boundaries.
