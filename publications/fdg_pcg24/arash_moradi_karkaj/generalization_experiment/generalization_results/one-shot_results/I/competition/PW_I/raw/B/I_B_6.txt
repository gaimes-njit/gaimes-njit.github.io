To generate the uppercase letter "B" using the given block types (`b11`, `b31`, `b13`), the following stream of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the third horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the third vertical straight block at position 4
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "B" within the allowed space boundaries.
