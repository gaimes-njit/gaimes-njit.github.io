To generate the uppercase English letter 'C', we can use a combination of the block types 'b31' and 'b13'. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to construct the letter 'C':

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable and accurate representation of the uppercase letter 'C' within the allowed space boundaries.
