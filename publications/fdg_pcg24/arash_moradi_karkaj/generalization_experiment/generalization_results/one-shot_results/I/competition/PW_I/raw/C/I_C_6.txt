To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can use the following commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
```

These commands will create the shape of the letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries.
