To generate the uppercase English letter "C", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)             # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1)             # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)             # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)             # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',4)             # Place the square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',4)             # Place the horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13',4)             # Place the vertical straight block at position 4
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries.
