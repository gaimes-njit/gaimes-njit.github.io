To generate the uppercase letter "D" in the Tetris-like environment, you would need to use the following series of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

By executing these commands consecutively, you will build the letter "D" within the allowed space, while ensuring structural stability based on the gravity rules of the environment.
