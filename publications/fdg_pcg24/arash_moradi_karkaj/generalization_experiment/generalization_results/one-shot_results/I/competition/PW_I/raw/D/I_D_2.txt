To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

``` 
ab_drop('b31',1) ab_drop('b13',1) ab_drop('b31',4) ab_drop('b13',4) ab_drop('b13',1) ab_drop('b11',2) ab_drop('b11',3) ab_drop('b11',4)
```

Explanation:

- First, we start by dropping a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
- Then, we drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to create the straight edge of the letter "D".
- Next, we drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4 to complete the top half of the letter "D".
- After that, we drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4 to create the straight edge of the letter "D" on the right side.
- Then, we drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to create the curved part of the letter "D".
- Finally, we drop three 1x1 square blocks (b11) at positions 2, 3, and 4 to fill in the circular part of the letter "D".

By following these instructions, the shapes will stack up correctly according to the 2D gravity rules and form the uppercase English letter "D".
