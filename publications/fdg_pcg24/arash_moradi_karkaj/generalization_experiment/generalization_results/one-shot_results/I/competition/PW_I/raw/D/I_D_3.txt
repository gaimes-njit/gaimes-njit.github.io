To generate the uppercase letter "D", we need to stack the following blocks:

1. Two vertical straight blocks (b13) to form the two vertical lines of the letter.
2. One horizontal straight block (b31) to form the top line of the letter.
3. One 1x1 square block (b11) to complete the letter shape.

The ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "D" are as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

Please note that these commands should be executed consecutively starting from the X position 1, as mentioned in the instructions.
