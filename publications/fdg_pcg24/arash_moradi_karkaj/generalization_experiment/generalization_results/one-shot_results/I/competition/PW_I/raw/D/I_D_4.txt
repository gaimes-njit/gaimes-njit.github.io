To generate the uppercase English letter "D", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)   # Place second horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 6)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 7)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 8)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 8
ab_drop('b31', 9)   # Place third horizontal straight block at position 9
```

This sequence of commands will create the "D" shape, resembling the uppercase English letter "D" within the allowed space boundaries.
