To generate the letter "D", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position (1,1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the second horizontal block at position (1,2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical block at position (2,1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical block at position (2,2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical block at position (2,3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the third horizontal block at position (1,3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the fourth horizontal block at position (1,4)
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "D" in the Tetris-like environment.
