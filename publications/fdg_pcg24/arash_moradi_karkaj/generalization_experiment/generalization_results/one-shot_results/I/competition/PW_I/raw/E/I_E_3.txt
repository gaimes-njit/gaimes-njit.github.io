To generate the letter "E" using the given block types in the defined environment, we can follow the following steps:

1. Place the first vertical straight block at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
2. Place the horizontal straight block at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
3. Place the first vertical straight block at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`
4. Place the horizontal straight block at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
5. Place the second vertical straight block at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "E" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
