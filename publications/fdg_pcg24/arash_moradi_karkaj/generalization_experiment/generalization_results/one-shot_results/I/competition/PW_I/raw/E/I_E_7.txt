To generate the uppercase English letter "E" using the given command and block types, we need to strategically place the blocks in the Tetris-like environment. Here's how we can do it:

```python
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "E" in the Tetris-like environment.
