To create the uppercase letter "F", we can break it down into three parts: the vertical line, the horizontal line at the top, and the horizontal line at the middle. 

Here's how we can achieve that:

1. Place the vertical line by using the `b13` block type. Start from width position 1 and go down 3 units. We can achieve this with the following command:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place the horizontal line at the top by using the `b31` block type. Start from width position 1 and go to position 3. We can achieve this with the following command:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Place the horizontal line at the middle by using the `b31` block type. Start from width position 1 and go to position 3. We can achieve this with the following command:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "F" is:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This will create the letter "F" within the defined environment while ensuring stability based on the gravity rules.
