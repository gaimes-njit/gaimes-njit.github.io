To generate the letter "F" using the given block types, here is the stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  // Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  // Place the second vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)  // Place the third vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',1)  // Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
```

This stream of commands will accurately represent the uppercase English letter "F" within the defined environment, while maintaining structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
