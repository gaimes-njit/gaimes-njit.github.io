To generate the letter "F", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b13',1)` places a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1 along the width.
2. The second command `ab_drop('b31',1)` places a horizontal straight block (`b31`) next to the previous block at position 2 along the width.
3. The third command `ab_drop('b13',1)` places another vertical straight block below the previous one at position 3 along the width.
4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b11',2)` places a small square block (`b11`) at position 2 along the width.
5. The fifth command `ab_drop('b31',2)` places another horizontal straight block next to the square block at position 3 along the width.

By following these commands, you will be able to generate the uppercase English letter "F" within the specified environment with the given block types and gravity rules.
