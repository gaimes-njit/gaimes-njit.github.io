To generate the uppercase letter "G", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

``` 
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place the square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place the square block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "G" within the allowed space boundaries, ensuring stacking and stability.
