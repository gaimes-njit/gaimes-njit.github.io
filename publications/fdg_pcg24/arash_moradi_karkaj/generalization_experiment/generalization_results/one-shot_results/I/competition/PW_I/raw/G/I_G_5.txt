To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block starting from position 1. This forms the top part of the "G".
2. Place a 1x1 square block at position 4. This forms the top-right part of the "G".
3. Place another horizontal straight block starting from position 1. This forms the middle part of the "G".
4. Place a 1x1 square block at position 1. This forms the bottom-right part of the "G".
5. Place a vertical straight block starting from position 3. This forms the vertical line of the "G".
6. Place a 1x1 square block at position 3. This connects the vertical line to the bottom part of the "G".
7. Place another horizontal straight block starting from position 1. This completes the bottom part of the "G".
8. Place a 1x1 square block at position 1. This forms the bottom-left part of the "G".
9. Place another horizontal straight block starting from position 1. This forms the bottom-left part of the "G".
10. Place a 1x1 square block at position 1. This connects the bottom-left part to the top part of the "G".
11. Place another horizontal straight block starting from position 1. This completes the top part of the "G".
12. Place a vertical straight block starting from position 3. This completes the vertical line of the "G" and forms its bottom part.

By following these commands, the letter "G" will be accurately represented and fit within the allowed space boundaries.
