To generate the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types and gravity rules, you can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:
1. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) next to the previous one at position 2.
3. Place the vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, creating the vertical line of the "H".
4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) next to the vertical line at position 3.
5. Place the final horizontal straight block (b31) next to the previous one at position 4, completing the horizontal line of the "H".

This set of commands will generate the uppercase letter "H" in the Tetris-like environment.
