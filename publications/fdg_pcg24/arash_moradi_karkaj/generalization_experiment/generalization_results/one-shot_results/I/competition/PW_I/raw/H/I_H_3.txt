To generate the uppercase letter "H" using the block types provided, you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the third horizontal block at position 1
```

This sequence of commands will generate the letter "H" in the defined Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
