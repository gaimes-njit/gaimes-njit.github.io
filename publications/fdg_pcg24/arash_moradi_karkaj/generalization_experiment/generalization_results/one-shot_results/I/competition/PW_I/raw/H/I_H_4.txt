To generate the letter "H", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. The second command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places another horizontal straight block (b31) adjacent to the previous one.
3. The third command `ab_drop('b11', 2)` places a 1x1 square block (b11) between the two horizontal blocks, creating the vertical line of the letter "H".
4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places another horizontal straight block (b31) below the vertical line, completing the left side of the letter "H".
5. The fifth command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places the final horizontal straight block (b31) below the previous one, completing the right side of the letter "H".

By following these commands, the letter "H" will be generated in the Tetris-like environment.
