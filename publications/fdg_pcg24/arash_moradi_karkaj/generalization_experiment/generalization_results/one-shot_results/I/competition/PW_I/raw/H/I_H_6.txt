To generate the letter "H" using the given block types, you can follow the below steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at the x position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`.
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at the x position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`.
3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at the x position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`.

The consecutive commands when put together will resemble the letter "H". Here is the full stream of commands:
