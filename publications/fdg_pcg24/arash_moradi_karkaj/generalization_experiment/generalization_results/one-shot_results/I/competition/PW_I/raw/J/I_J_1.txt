To generate the uppercase letter "J" using the given block types and commands, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: ab_drop('b31',1).
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) below the first block at position 1: ab_drop('b13',1).
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) below the previous block at position 2: ab_drop('b13',2).

The stream of commands would be:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```
