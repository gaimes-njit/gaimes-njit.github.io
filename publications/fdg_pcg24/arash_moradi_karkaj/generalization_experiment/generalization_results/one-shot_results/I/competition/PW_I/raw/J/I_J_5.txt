ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 5)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 5)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 5
