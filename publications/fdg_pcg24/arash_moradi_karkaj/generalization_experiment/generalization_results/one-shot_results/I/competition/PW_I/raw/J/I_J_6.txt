To generate the uppercase letter "J", you can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
```

These commands will create the letter "J" with the given block types in the defined environment.
