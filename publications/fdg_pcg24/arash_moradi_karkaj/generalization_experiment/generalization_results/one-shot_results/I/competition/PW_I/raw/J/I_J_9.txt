To generate the uppercase letter "J", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will stack and arrange the blocks in the shape of the letter "J" within the defined environment, while maintaining stability according to the gravity rules.
