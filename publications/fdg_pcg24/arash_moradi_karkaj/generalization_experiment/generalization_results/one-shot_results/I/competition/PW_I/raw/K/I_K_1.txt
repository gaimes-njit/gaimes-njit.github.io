To generate the uppercase letter "K" using the provided block types, you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',4)   # Place another vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place a square block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',3)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',4)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 4
```

This sequence of commands will create an uppercase "K" within the allowed space boundaries while adhering to the gravity rules.
