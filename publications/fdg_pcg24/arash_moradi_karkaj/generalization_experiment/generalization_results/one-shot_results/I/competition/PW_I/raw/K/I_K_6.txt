To generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

This stream of commands will create the shape of the letter "K" in the defined environment, following the stacking and stability rules.
