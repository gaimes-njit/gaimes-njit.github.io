To create the uppercase letter "K", you can use the following series of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) above the previous block at position 1.
3. Place another 1x1 square block (b11) beside the previous block at position 2.
4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) beside the previous blocks at position 2.
5. Place another 1x1 square block (b11) above the previous blocks at position 3.
6. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) above the previous blocks at position 3 to complete the letter "K".

This series of commands will create a stably stacked uppercase "K" within the allowed space boundaries.
