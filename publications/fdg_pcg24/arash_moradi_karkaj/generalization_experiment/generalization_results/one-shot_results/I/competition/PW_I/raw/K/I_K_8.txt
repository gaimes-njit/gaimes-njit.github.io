To generate the uppercase English letter "K", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical block attached to the first horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the second horizontal block separated from the first block
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the vertical block attached to the second horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the third horizontal block separated from the second block
```

By following these commands, you can create the uppercase letter "K" within the allowed space in the Tetris-like environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
