To create the uppercase letter "K", we will use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)         # Place the horizontal segment at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)         # Place the vertical segment at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)         # Place the vertical segment at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)         # Place the horizontal segment at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 3)         # Place the vertical segment at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will result in the formation of the uppercase letter "K" within the boundaries of the specified environment.
