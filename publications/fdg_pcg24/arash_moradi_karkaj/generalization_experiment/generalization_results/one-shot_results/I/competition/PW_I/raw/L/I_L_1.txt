To generate the uppercase letter "L", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)   // Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',4)   // Place a vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11',4)   // Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11',5)   // Place a square block at position 5
ab_drop('b11',6)   // Place a square block at position 6
ab_drop('b11',7)   // Place a square block at position 7
```

By executing these commands consecutively, you will be able to construct the uppercase letter "L" within the allowed space boundaries and following the gravity rules.
