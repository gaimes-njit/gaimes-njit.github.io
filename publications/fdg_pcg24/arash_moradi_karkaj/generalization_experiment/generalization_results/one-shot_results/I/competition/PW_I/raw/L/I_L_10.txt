To create the uppercase letter "L" in the Tetris-like environment, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)      # Drop vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',1)      # Drop horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)      # Drop vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)      # Drop vertical straight block at position 3
```

These commands will form the letter "L" when executed consecutively.
