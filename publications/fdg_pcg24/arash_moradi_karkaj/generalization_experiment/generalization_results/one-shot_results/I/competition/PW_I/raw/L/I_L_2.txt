To create the uppercase letter "L" using the given block types, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1, which represents the vertical line of the letter "L".
2. Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2, which represents the horizontal line of the letter "L".
3. Finally, place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2 to complete the letter "L".

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "L" with the given block types.
