To generate the uppercase letter "L" using the given block types and commands, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

This will create the letter "L" using the vertical straight block (b13) repeated three times and the horizontal straight block (b31) placed at the bottom to complete the shape.
