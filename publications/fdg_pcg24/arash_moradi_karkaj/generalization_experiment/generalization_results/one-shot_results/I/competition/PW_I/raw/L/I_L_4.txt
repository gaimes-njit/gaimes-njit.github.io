To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1) ab_drop('b31',1) ab_drop('b31',2)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b13',1)` places a vertical straight block at position 1 along the width, creating the vertical line of the "L".
- The second command `ab_drop('b31',1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1 along the width, extending the horizontal line of the "L".
- The third command `ab_drop('b31',2)` places another horizontal straight block at position 2 along the width, completing the horizontal line of the "L" and giving it its characteristic shape.

By executing these commands in the specified order, we will generate the uppercase English letter "L" in the defined environment.
