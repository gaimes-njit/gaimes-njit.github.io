To generate the uppercase letter "L", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place another square block at position 3 to complete the letter L
```
