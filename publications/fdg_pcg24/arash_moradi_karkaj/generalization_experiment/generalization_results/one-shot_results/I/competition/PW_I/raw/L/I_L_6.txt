To generate the uppercase English letter "L", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

This will place a horizontal straight block at position 1, followed by three vertical straight blocks at positions 2, 3, and 4. The resulting shape will resemble the letter "L" within the allowed space boundaries.
