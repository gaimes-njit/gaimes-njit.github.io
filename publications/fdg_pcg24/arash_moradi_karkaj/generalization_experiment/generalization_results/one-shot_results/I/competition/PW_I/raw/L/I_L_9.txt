To generate the letter "L", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  -> Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  -> Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  -> Place another vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 3)  -> Place a square block on top of the vertical straight block
```

The resulting shape will resemble the uppercase letter "L" in a Tetris-like environment.
