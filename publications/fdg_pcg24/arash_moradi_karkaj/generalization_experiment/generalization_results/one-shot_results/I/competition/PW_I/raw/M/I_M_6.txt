To generate the uppercase English letter "M", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

This will create the shape of the letter "M" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring stability with regard to the gravity rules.
