To generate the uppercase English letter "N," we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
```

These commands will create the letter "N" within the allowed space boundaries and maintain stability according to the gravity rules.
