To generate the uppercase letter "N", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b31',5)
ab_drop('b13',9)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command, ab_drop('b13',1), places a vertical straight block at position 1 along the width.
2. The second command, ab_drop('b31',1), places a horizontal straight block at position 1 along the width.
3. The third command, ab_drop('b13',5), places a vertical straight block at position 5 along the width.
4. The fourth command, ab_drop('b31',5), places a horizontal straight block at position 5 along the width.
5. The fifth command, ab_drop('b13',9), places a vertical straight block at position 9 along the width.

These commands create the shape of the letter "N" within the allowed space boundaries.
