To generate the uppercase letter "N", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 1 along the width. This forms the left vertical part of the letter "N".
- The second command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places another horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 2 along the width. This extends the left vertical part of the letter "N".
- The third command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places a vertical straight block (b13) starting from position 2 along the width. This forms the middle part of the letter "N".
- The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 3)` places another horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 3 along the width. This extends the middle part of the letter "N".
- The fifth command `ab_drop('b31', 4)` places the final horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 4 along the width. This forms the right vertical part of the letter "N".

Together, these commands construct the uppercase letter "N" within the allowed space and boundaries.
