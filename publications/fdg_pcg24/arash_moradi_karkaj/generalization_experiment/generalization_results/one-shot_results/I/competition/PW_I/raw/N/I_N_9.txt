To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

``` python
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Explanation:
- The first ab_drop('b13',1) command places a vertical straight block at x=1, creating the left side of the letter "N".
- The second ab_drop('b31',1) command places a horizontal straight block at x=1, extending to x=3 and connecting to the left vertical block.
- The third ab_drop('b13',2) command places a vertical straight block at x=2, creating the middle bar of the letter "N".
- The fourth ab_drop('b31',2) command places a horizontal straight block at x=2, extending to x=4 and connecting to the middle vertical block.
- The fifth ab_drop('b13',3) command places a vertical straight block at x=3, creating the right side of the letter "N".
