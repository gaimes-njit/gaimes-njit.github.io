To create the letter "O" using the given block types and gravity rules, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: ab_drop('b31', 1).
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 1: ab_drop('b13', 1).
3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous block at position 1: ab_drop('b31', 1).
4. Finally, place a vertical straight block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 1: ab_drop('b13', 1).

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "O" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
