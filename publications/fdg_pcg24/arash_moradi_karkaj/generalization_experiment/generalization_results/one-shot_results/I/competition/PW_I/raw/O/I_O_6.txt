To generate the uppercase English letter "O", we can use the following stream of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at the leftmost position
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block below the left corner of the horizontal straight block
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place another vertical straight block below the right corner of the horizontal straight block
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place another horizontal straight block to the right of the vertical straight blocks
```

This will create a stable and accurate representation of the uppercase letter "O" within the defined boundaries.
