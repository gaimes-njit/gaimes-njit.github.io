To create the letter "O" using the mentioned block types and environment, the following `ab_drop()` commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',4)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31',1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1 along the width.
- The second command `ab_drop('b13',1)` places a vertical straight block at position 1 along the width, just below the previous block.
- The third command `ab_drop('b13',4)` places another vertical straight block at position 4 along the width, to the right of the previous block.
- The fourth command `ab_drop('b31',4)` places the last horizontal straight block at position 4 along the width, below the previous block.

These commands will result in the creation of the uppercase English letter "O" within the allowed space and following the gravity rules.
