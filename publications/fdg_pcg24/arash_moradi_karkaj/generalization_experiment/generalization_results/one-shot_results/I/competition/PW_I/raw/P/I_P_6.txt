To generate the uppercase letter "P" using the given block types and gravity rules, you would need to use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

By consecutively executing these commands, you would create the letter "P" within the defined environment while ensuring stacking and stability.
