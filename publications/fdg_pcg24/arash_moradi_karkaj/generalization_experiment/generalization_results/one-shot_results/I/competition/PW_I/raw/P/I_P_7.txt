To generate the uppercase letter "P", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "P" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
