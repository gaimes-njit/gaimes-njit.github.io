To generate the uppercase letter "P", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "P" in the defined environment by stacking and placing the blocks according to the gravity rules.
