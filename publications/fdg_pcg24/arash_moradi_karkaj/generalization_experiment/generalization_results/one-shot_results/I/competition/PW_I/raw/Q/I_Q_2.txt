To generate the uppercase letter "Q" using ab_drop() commands, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to create the top part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Next, drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4 to create the left side of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

3. Drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4, overlapping the previous block, to create the bottom part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

4. Finally, drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 7 to complete the right side of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

The complete stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "Q" would look like this:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```
