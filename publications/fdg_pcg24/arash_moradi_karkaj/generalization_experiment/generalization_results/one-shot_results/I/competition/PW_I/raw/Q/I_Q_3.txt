To generate the uppercase letter "Q" using the specified block types, the following sequence of ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the second vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the third vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the bottom square block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the diagonal block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the bottom horizontal block at position 4
```

These commands would create a stable representation of the uppercase letter "Q" within the given space boundaries.
