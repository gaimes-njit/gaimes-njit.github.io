To generate the uppercase letter "Q", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',3)  # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',4)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13',4)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13',5)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 5
```

These commands will construct the uppercase letter "Q" using the block types and following the gravity rules in the defined environment.
