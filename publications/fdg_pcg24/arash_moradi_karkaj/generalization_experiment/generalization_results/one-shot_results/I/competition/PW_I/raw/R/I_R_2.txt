To generate the uppercase letter "R" using the provided block types and environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a single square block at position (1,1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position (1,2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position (3,2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position (3,3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position (1,3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place a single square block at position (2,3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a single square block at position (3,3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a single square block at position (3,3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a single square block at position (3,3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a single square block at position (3,3)
```

These commands will stack the blocks in the correct positions to form the uppercase letter "R" within the defined environment.
