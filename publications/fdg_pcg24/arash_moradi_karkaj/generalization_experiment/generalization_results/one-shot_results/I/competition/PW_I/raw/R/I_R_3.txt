To generate the uppercase English letter "R", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "R" within the allowed space boundaries and adhere to the gravity rules.
