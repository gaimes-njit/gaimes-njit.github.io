To create the uppercase letter "R", we can follow the below steps:

1. Place a b13 block at position (1, 1) using the command `ab_drop('b13',1)`. This will create the vertical stem of the letter "R".

2. Place a b31 block at position (2, 1) using the command `ab_drop('b31',1)`. This will create the first horizontal line of the letter "R".

3. Place a b31 block at position (2, 2) using the command `ab_drop('b31',2)`. This will create the second horizontal line of the letter "R".

4. Place a b13 block at position (4, 1) using the command `ab_drop('b13',1)`. This will create the top diagonal line of the letter "R".

After following these steps, the resulting stream of commands would be:

```
ab_drop('b13',1) 
ab_drop('b31',1) 
ab_drop('b31',2) 
ab_drop('b13',1)
```
