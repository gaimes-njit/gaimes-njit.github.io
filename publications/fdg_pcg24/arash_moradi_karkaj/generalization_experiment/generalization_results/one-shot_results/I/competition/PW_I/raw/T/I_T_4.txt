To generate the capital letter "T" using the given block types and environment, the following sequence of ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place the square block at position 2
```

By following these commands, the "T" shape will be formed with stability within the grid boundaries.
