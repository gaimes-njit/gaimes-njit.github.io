To generate the uppercase English letter "T" using the ab_drop() command and the given block types within the defined environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block of type b31 at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block of type b13 at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place a horizontal straight block of type b31 at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The sequence of commands will resemble the target letter "T" and ensure structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
