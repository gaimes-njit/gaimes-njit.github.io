To generate the uppercase English letter "U", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 13)
```

Explanation:

1. The first command places a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 along the width.
2. The second command places a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 along the width.
3. The third command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 4 along the width.
4. The fourth command places another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 4 along the width.
5. The fifth command places the final horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 7 along the width.
6. The sixth, seventh, and eighth commands place three individual square blocks ('b11') at positions 1, 7, and 13 along the width respectively, to complete the letter "U".

By following these commands in sequence, you will be able to generate the uppercase English letter "U" within the defined environment and gravity rules.
