To generate the uppercase letter "U" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Drop a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1.
3. Drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4.
4. Drop a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4.

The stream of commands would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
