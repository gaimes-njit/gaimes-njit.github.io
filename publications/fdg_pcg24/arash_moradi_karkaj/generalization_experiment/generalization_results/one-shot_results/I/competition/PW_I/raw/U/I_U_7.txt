To generate the uppercase letter "U", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Explanation:
- The first command places a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 along the width.
- The second command places a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 along the width.
- The third command places a square block ('b11') at position 3 along the width.
- The fourth command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 4 along the width.
- The fifth command places another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 4 along the width.

By following these commands, the blocks will be stacked and positioned correctly to form the uppercase letter "U".
