To create the letter "U" using the given block types, here are the necessary ab_drop() commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)    # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 2)    # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)    # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 3)    # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
```

By executing these commands consecutively, the letter "U" will be generated within the defined environment, ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
