To generate the letter "U" using the given block types and environment, you can follow the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place a square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place a square block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 5
```

By executing these commands consecutively in the given environment, you will be able to construct the uppercase letter "U" while ensuring structural stability according to the gravity rules.
