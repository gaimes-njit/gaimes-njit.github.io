To generate the letter "V" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

These commands will place the blocks in a way that forms the uppercase letter "V" within the allowed space and follows the gravity rules.
