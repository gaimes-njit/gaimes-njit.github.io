To generate the letter "V" using the given block types and constraints, you can use the following command:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

These commands will create a "V" shape within the allowed space, following the gravity rules.
