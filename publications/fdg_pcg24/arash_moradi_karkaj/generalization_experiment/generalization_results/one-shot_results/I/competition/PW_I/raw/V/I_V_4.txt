To generate the capital letter "V", we can use the block types b31 and b13. The structure of the letter "V" consists of two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the sides and a horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "V":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)            # Place the first vertical block on the left side
ab_drop('b31', 2)            # Place the horizontal block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 4)            # Place the second vertical block on the right side
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable and accurate representation of the capital letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries.
