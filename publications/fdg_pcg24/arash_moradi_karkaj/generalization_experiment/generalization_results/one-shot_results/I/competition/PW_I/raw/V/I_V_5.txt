To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

These commands will create a vertical straight block for the left side of the "V" (placed at positions 1, 2, and 3), followed by a horizontal straight block on top to complete the letter "V" shape.
