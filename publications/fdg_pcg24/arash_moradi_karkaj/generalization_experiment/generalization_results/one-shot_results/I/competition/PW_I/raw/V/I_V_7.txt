To generate the uppercase letter "V", you can use the following stream of commands using the block types mentioned:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the shape of the letter "V" within the allowed space and follow the gravity rules.
