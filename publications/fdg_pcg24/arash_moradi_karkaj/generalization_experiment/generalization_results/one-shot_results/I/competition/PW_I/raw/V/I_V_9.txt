To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

This will create the letter "V" with the given block types and follow the gravity rules in the defined environment.
