To generate the letter "W", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the third horizontal straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place the third vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place the fourth horizontal straight block at position 10
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Place the fourth vertical straight block at position 10
ab_drop('b31', 13)  # Place the fifth horizontal straight block at position 13
ab_drop('b13', 13)  # Place the fifth vertical straight block at position 13
ab_drop('b31', 16)  # Place the sixth horizontal straight block at position 16
ab_drop('b13', 16)  # Place the sixth vertical straight block at position 16
ab_drop('b31', 19)  # Place the seventh horizontal straight block at position 19
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable representation of the letter "W" within the boundaries of the allowed space.
