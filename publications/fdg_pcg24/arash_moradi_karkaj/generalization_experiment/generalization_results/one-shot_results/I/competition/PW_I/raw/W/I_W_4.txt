To generate the uppercase English letter "W" using ab_drop() commands and the defined block types, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

These commands will stack the block types in the correct positions to resemble the letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries and gravity rules.
