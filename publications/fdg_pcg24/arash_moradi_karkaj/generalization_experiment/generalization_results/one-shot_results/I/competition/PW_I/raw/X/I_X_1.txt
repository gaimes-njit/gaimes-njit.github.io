To generate the letter "X" using the provided block types, we need to carefully stack and position the blocks. Here's a stream of commands that will achieve the desired result:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:

1. `ab_drop('b13', 2)`: This command places a vertical block (b13) at position 2 along the width.
2. `ab_drop('b31', 1)`: This command places a horizontal block (b31) at position 1 along the width.
3. `ab_drop('b13', 1)`: This command places another vertical block (b13) at position 1 along the width.
4. `ab_drop('b31', 3)`: This command places another horizontal block (b31) at position 3 along the width.
5. `ab_drop('b13', 3)`: This command places a final vertical block (b13) at position 3 along the width.

When executed consecutively, these commands will stack the blocks in the correct positions and form the letter "X" within the allowed space boundaries.
