To generate the uppercase English letter "X", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  // Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)  // Place the vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',5)  // Place the horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13',7)  // Place the vertical straight block at position 7
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable arrangement of blocks that resemble the letter "X" within the allowed space.
