To generate the uppercase letter "X" using the given block types and commands, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command places a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 along the width.
2. The second command places a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 along the width, aligning with the bottom of the previous block.
3. The third command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3 along the width, aligning with the top of the previous block.
4. The fourth command places another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3 along the width, aligning with the bottom of the previous block.

By following these commands, the blocks will be stacked and aligned to form the uppercase letter "X" within the allowed space boundaries.
