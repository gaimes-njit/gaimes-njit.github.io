To generate the uppercase English letter "X", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in a way that forms the letter "X" within the allowed space and ensures structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
