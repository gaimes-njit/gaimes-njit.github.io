To create the letter "X" using the mentioned block types, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will build the letter "X" within the allowed space boundaries and ensure stability based on the gravity rules.
