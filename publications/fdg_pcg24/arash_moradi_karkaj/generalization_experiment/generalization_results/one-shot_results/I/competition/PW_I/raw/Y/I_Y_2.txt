To generate the uppercase letter "Y", we will need to strategically place the blocks in the following pattern:

```
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place the vertical block in the middle
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal block on the left
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the vertical block on the left
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal block on the right
```

This will result in the letter "Y" being formed within the defined environment and following the gravity rules.
