To generate the uppercase English letter "Y" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a b31 block at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place a b13 block above the previous one at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
3. Place another b31 block above the previous one at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`
4. Finally, place a b11 block above the previous one at position 2: `ab_drop('b11', 2)`
