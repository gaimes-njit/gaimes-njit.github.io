To create the uppercase letter "Y", we can use a combination of block types b31 and b13. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to construct the letter:

``` 
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 3)    # Place the horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place the horizontal block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "Y" in the defined environment.
