To generate the letter "Z" using the mentioned command and block types, the following stream of commands can be used:

``` 
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the required positions to form the letter "Z" in the defined environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
