To generate the uppercase letter "Z", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1) ab_drop('b31',1) ab_drop('b13',2) ab_drop('b31',2) ab_drop('b13',3)
```

This will create the letter "Z" by stacking the blocks in the required pattern while maintaining stability within the defined environment.
