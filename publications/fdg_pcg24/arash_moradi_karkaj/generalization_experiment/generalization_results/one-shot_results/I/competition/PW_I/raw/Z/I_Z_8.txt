To generate the uppercase letter "Z" using the given block types and gravity rules, follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
   ```ab_drop('b31',1)```
   
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) to the right of the previous block, at position 2:
   ```ab_drop('b13',2)```
   
3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) to the right of the previous block, at position 3:
   ```ab_drop('b31',3)```
   
4. Place another vertical straight block (b13) to the right of the previous block, at position 4:
   ```ab_drop('b13',4)```
   
5. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) below the top row, starting from position 2:
   ```ab_drop('b31',2)```

The stream of commands to generate the letter "Z" would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```
