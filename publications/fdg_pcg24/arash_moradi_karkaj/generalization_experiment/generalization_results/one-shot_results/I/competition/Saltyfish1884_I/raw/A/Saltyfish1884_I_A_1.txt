In order to generate a structure that resembles the character "A" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow the following step-by-step approach:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Step 2: Place the base of the "A" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This places a b31 block at slot 9 (centered horizontally) on the bottom layer.

Step 3: Place the diagonal parts of the "A" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```
This places two b13 blocks at slots 7 and 11 on the second layer from the bottom, forming the diagonal parts of the "A" shape.

Step 4: Place the horizontal bar of the "A" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This places another b31 block at slot 9 on the third layer from the bottom, forming the horizontal bar of the "A" shape.

The final structure will resemble the character "A" and meet all the given constraints.

Note: The actual code may involve iterative steps, adjusting the slot position and block type based on the stability rules and boundary intrusion constraint. This is just a simplified representation to demonstrate the concept.
