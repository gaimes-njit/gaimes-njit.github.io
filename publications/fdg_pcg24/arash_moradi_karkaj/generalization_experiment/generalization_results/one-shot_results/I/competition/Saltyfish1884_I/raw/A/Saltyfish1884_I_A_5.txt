To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "A", we can follow these steps:

1. Set up the initial empty structure with the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping position and order of the blocks in order to meet the stability constraint:
   - Place a b13 block in the center slot of the base layer (layer 0):
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

   - Place a b31 block on top of the previously placed b13 block, aligned with the center slot:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

   - Place another b31 block on top of the previous one, slightly off-center to form the top part of the "A" shape:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ```

   - Place a b11 block on top of the base layer in the center slot to connect the top parts of the "A" shape:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 9)
   ```

   - Place another b11 block on top of the previous one, aligned with the center slot:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 9)
   ```

3. The final structure will resemble the character "A" and satisfy the stability constraint.

The Python code to generate the structure would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

This code will vertically drop the blocks in the specified order and positions using the ab_drop() function. The resulting structure will have the desired "A" shape and meet all the given constraints.
