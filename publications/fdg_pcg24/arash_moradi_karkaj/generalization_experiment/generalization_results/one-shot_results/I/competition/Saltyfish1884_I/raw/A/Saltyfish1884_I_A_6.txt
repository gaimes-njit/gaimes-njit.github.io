Based on the given constraints and the aim to generate a structure that resembles the character "A," we need to carefully plan the position and order of the blocks to ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion.

Here is a step-by-step approach to generate the structure:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b31 block in the center of the structure's bottom layer (layer 0) using the ab_drop() function. This block will form the base of the "A" shape:

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Place a b31 block centered on top of the previous block, on layer 1, to continue forming the center of the "A" shape:

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

4. Place a b13 block centered on top of the previous two blocks, on layer 2, to form the center vertical line of the "A" shape:

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

5. Place a b11 block centered above the previous three blocks, on layer 3, to form the top of the "A" shape:

```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

6. Repeat steps 2-5 on the left side of the structure to mirror the "A" shape. Place a b31 block centered on the left side of the base in layer 1, then a b13 block centered on top of it in layer 2, and finally a b11 block centered above them in layer 3.

7. Repeat steps 2-6 on the right side of the structure to complete the "A" shape.

The resulting structure will resemble the character "A" and will meet all the given hard constraints, including stability and no boundary intrusion.

Note: The slot numbers indicated in the code are approximate and may need adjustment to achieve the desired positioning.
