To generate a structure that resembles the character "A" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping positions and order of each block type ('b31', 'b13', 'b31') to form the shape of the character "A". We need to consider stability and no boundary intrusion constraints while making these decisions.

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to place the blocks in their determined dropping positions and order. This will update the `structure` variable accordingly.

Here's a possible solution based on the provided example:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

This solution assumes that the goal is to create a capital letter "A" with a width of 3 units and a height of 4 units. The dropping positions for each block type are chosen to form the shape of the letter "A". The specific y-coordinate of 4 is chosen to keep enough distance from the boundaries and maintain stability.

You can modify the dropping positions and order according to your specific requirements and constraints to generate a structure resembling the given character.
