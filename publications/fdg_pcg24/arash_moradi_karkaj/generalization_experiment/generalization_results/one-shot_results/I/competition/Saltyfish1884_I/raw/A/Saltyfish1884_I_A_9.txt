To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "A" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully determine the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) at the bottom layer to provide a solid base for stability:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Place a b11 block at slot 9 (center)
ab_drop('b11', 10) # Place another b11 block at slot 10 (center)
ab_drop('b11', 11) # Place another b11 block at slot 11 (center)
```

3. Place the upper part of the "A" structure using b31 blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place a b31 block at slot 9 (center)
ab_drop('b31', 11) # Place another b31 block at slot 11 (center)
```

4. Place the remaining lower part of the "A" structure using b13 blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place a b13 block at slot 9 (center)
ab_drop('b13', 11) # Place another b13 block at slot 11 (center)
```

5. The final structure will resemble the character "A" and meet the stability and boundary constraints.

Note: The order and positions of the blocks mentioned above are just an example. You can experiment with different positions to achieve a stable "A" structure that meets all the given requirements.
