To generate a structure that resembles the character "B" using the ab_drop() function while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by defining the structure as an empty grid using the provided initialization code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the initial block (b31) at the bottom layer (layer 0) and aligned with the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Place the next block (b13) on top of the previously placed block, aligned with the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Place the final block (b31) on top of the previously placed block, aligned with the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "B" and meet the stability constraint as the b31 blocks are placed on a solid base (b11 and b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. The blocks are also placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing. Additionally, this structure will not intrude on the boundary of the map.

Note: The slot numbers used in the example (1 and 9) are just placeholders. The actual slot numbers may vary depending on the desired positioning and spacing of the blocks.
