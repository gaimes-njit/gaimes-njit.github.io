To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "B" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
W = 20  # width of the map
H = 16  # height of the map
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place a b31 block on the base to start building the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place a b31 block with its center aligned at slot 9
```

Step 3: Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block to form the vertical line of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place a b13 block with its center aligned at slot 9
```

Step 4: Place another b31 block on top of the b13 block to complete the top bar of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place a b31 block with its center aligned at slot 9
```

The final result will be a stable structure resembling the character "B" on the grid.

Note: The specific slot numbers used in the example may need to be adjusted depending on the desired position and size of the character "B".
