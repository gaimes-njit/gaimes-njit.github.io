To generate a stable structure resembling the character "B" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```
2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the desired slot. Since stability is a concern, we should drop it on the base (layer 0) to prevent overhangs. Choose a suitable slot for the block's center alignment.
```
ab_drop('b31', <slot_number>)
```
3. Next, drop a b13 block on top of the b31 block. Again, choose a suitable slot for alignment. This will form the left side of the "B" character.
```
ab_drop('b13', <slot_number>)
```
4. Finally, drop another b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligning it with the previous b31 block. This will complete the structure resembling the character "B".
```
ab_drop('b31', <slot_number>)
```

Ensure that you choose the dropping positions and order in such a way that the structure remains stable and does not violate any of the given constraints.

Note: The exact slot numbers and ordering of the blocks may vary based on the specific requirements and desired appearance of the "B" character. Experiment with different positions to find the most stable and visually appealing structure.
