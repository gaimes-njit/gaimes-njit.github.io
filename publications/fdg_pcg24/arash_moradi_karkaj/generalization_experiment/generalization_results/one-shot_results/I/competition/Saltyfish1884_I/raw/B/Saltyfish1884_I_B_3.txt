To generate a structure that resembles the character "B" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code: 

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base b11 block at the bottom of the structure:

```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

This will ensure stability and serve as the foundation for the structure.

3. Place the upper part of the "B" shape by dropping a b13 block centered on slot 7:

```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

This will create the vertical line on the left side of the "B".

4. Place the bottom part of the "B" shape by dropping a b31 block centered on slot 13:

```
ab_drop('b31', 13)
```

This block will connect the vertical line to the horizontal line, completing the "B" shape.

The final structure should resemble the character "B" and satisfy all hard constraints.
