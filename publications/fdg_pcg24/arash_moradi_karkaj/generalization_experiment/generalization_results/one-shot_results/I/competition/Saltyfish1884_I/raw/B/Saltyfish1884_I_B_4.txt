To generate a stable structure resembling the character "B", we need to carefully consider the constraints and the order of dropping the blocks. 

Step 1: Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Based on the stability constraint, we need to start with a solid base. Let's drop a b11 block at slot 0:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

Step 3: To create the two vertical parts of the "B", we can drop two b13 blocks above the solid base. Place them at slots 1 and 2:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Step 4: To create the top horizontal part of the "B", we can drop a b31 block above the two vertical blocks. Place it at slot 1:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 5: Finally, to ensure stability and minimize the risk of collapsing, we need to lower the structure as much as possible. Let's drop a b11 block at slot 0 on top of the existing structure:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

The complete Python code to generate the stable structure resembling the character "B" would be:
```python
W = 20  # Width of the map
H = 16  # Height of the map

# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks to form the structure
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

This will create a stable structure resembling the character "B" while meeting all the specified constraints.
