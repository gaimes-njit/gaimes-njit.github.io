To generate a structure that resembles the character "B", we can proceed step by step while considering the constraints:

1. Add a b31 block at slot 1.
2. Add a b13 block at slot 1.
3. Add a b31 block at slot 1.

The Python code for generating this structure would be:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This will create a stable structure that resembles the character "B" while meeting all the hard constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.
