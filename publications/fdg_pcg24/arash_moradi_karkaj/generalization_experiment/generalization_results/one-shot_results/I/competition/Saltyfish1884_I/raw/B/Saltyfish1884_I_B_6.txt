In order to generate a stable structure resembling the character "B" using the ab_drop() function, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by placing a b13 block at the bottom layer on slot 4:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

3. Place a b11 block on top of the b13 block at slot 3:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

4. Place a b31 block horizontally on top of the b13 block covering slots 4, 5, and 6:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

5. Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block covering slot 4:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

6. Place a b31 block horizontally on top of the b13 block covering slots 3, 4, and 5:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

7. Place a b11 block on top of the b13 block at slot 3:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

8. Finally, place a b31 block horizontally on top of the b13 block covering slots 5, 6, and 7:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

The resulting structure should resemble the character "B" and meet all the stability constraints.
