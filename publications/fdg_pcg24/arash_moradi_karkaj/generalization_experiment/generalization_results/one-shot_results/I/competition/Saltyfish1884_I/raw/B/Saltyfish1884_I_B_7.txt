To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "B", we can follow these steps:

1. Create the base:
   - Place a b31 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) aligned with slot 1. This will act as the base of the structure.

2. Build the vertical part of the left side of the "B":
   - Place a b13 block above the base at slot 1 on layer 1.
   - Place a b13 block above the previous block at slot 1 on layer 4.
   - Place a b31 block above the previous block at slot 1 on layer 7.

3. Build the horizontal part of the "B" at the top:
   - Place a b31 block above the base at slot 1 on layer 14.
   - Place a b31 block next to the previous block at slot 2 on layer 14.

The resulting structure will resemble the character "B" and meet all the hard constraints. To generate this structure using the ab_drop() function, you can use the following code:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Note: The order and position of block placement are crucial to meet the stability and boundary constraints.
