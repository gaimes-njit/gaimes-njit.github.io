To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "B" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the first b31 block at the leftmost slot (slot 0) aligned vertically:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Place the second b13 block at the same slot (slot 0) aligned horizontally:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Place the third b31 block at the rightmost slot (slot 19) aligned vertically:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 19)
```

5. The resulting structure will resemble the character "B" and satisfy all the hard constraints.

You can run the above code step by step in a Python program to generate the desired structure. Make sure to have the ab_drop() function defined and the necessary imports, if any.
