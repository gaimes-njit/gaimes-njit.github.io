To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "B" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks.

First, let's analyze the stability constraints:
5.1.1 A b31 block must be placed on a solid base to prevent overhangs.
5.1.2 Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
5.1.3 Structure should not be separated.

Based on these constraints, the shape of the structure should have the following layers:
Layer 0: Solid base (b11 or b13 blocks)
Layer 1-4: Vertical b13 block
Layer 5-9: Horizontal b31 block
Layer 10-13: Vertical b13 block
Layer 14-15: Solid top (b11 or b13 blocks)

Now, let's use the ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks to form the structure:

Step 1: Place the solid base in layers 0 and 1
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)

Step 2: Place b13 blocks in layers 2-4
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)

Step 3: Place the horizontal b31 block in layers 5-9
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 0)

Step 4: Place b13 blocks in layers 10-13
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)

Step 5: Place the solid top in layers 14 and 15
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)

The final structure will resemble the character "B" and meet all hard constraints.
