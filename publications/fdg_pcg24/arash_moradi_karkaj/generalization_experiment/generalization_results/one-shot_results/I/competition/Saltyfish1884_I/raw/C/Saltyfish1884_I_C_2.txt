To generate a structure that resembles the character "C" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. 

First, let's analyze the stability requirements:
1. A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
2. Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
3. The structure should not be separated.

Based on these requirements, we can determine the shape of the structure to resemble the character "C". 

The structure should consist of a b31 block placed at the bottom-left corner to act as the base of the "C". Then, a b13 block should be placed on top of the b31 block, aligned with its left edge. Finally, another b31 block should be placed on top of the b13 block, aligned with its right edge.

Here is the step-by-step process to generate the structure using the ab_drop() function:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the b31 block at the bottom-left corner of the structure:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Place the b13 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with its left edge:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Place the second b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with its right edge:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

5. The final structure will resemble the character "C" and meet all the given constraints.

Here is the python code to generate the structure:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# place the b31 block at the bottom-left corner
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# place the b13 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with its left edge
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# place the second b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with its right edge
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

You can modify the code based on the given character or any other desired shape by adjusting the block types and dropping positions accordingly.
