To generate a structure that resembles the character "C" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the placement of the blocks taking into consideration the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is a step-by-step approach to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11) to create a solid base at the bottom layer:
```python
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop('b11', i)
```

3. Place the vertical block (b13) to form the vertical part of the character "C":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Place the horizontal block (b31) to form the top part of the character "C":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

5. Place additional blocks to connect the vertical and horizontal parts and complete the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 3)     # To connect the top left corner
ab_drop('b11', 0)     # To connect the bottom left corner
ab_drop('b11', 4)     # To connect the bottom right corner
```

This sequence of ab_drop() function calls will generate a stable structure resembling the character "C" while satisfying all the hard constraints.
