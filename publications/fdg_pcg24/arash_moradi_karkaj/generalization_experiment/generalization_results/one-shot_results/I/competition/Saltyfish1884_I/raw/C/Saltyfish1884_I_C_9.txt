To generate a stable structure resembling the character "C" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Identify the proper dropping position for each block type.

b31 block:
- It must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
- It should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
- It should not intrude on the map's boundaries (W and H).

b13 block:
- It should be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
- It should be placed directly below the b31 block to form the shape of "C".
- It should not intrude on the map's boundaries (W and H).

b31 block (second placement):
- It should be placed on top of the b13 block to complete the shape of "C".
- It should not intrude on the map's boundaries (W and H).

Step 3: Use the ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks to form the structure that resembles the character "C".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The above code will vertically drop a b31 block at slot 1, followed by a b13 block at slot 1, and finally another b31 block at slot 1. This will create a stable structure in the shape of "C" while meeting all hard constraints.

Note: The example provided in part 6 is just one possible solution. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints, the placement of blocks may vary. The above steps provide a general approach to generating the structure.
