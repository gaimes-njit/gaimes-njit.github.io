To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "D" using the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid with W slots and H layers.
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Drop a b13 block to form the left vertical side of the "D" shape.
ab_drop('b13', 1)

Step 3: Drop a b31 block on top of the b13 block to form the top horizontal part of the "D" shape.
ab_drop('b31', 1)

Step 4: Drop another b13 block on top of the b31 block to form the right vertical side of the "D" shape.
ab_drop('b13', 1)

Step 5: The resulting structure will resemble the character "D", with stable placement of blocks and no boundary intrusion.

You can adjust the slot numbers and order of block drops in the ab_drop() function to achieve different variations of the "D" shape.
