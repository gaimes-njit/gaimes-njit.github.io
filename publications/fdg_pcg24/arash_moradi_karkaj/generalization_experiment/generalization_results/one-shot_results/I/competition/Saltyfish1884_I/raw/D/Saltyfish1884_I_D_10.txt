To generate a structure that resembles the character "D", we need to carefully consider the constraints and the shape of the structure. 

Starting with the stability constraint, we know that a b31 block must be placed on a solid base to prevent overhangs. Therefore, we should start by dropping a b11 block to create a stable base. We can then follow this with a b31 block on top of the base to form the vertical line of the "D". Finally, we can complete the "D" shape by adding a b13 block on the right side of the vertical line.

Here is the step-by-step solution using the ab_drop() function:

1. Drop a b11 block at slot 0 to create a stable base:
ab_drop('b11', 0)

2. Drop a b31 block at slot 0 to form the vertical line:
ab_drop('b31', 0)

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 4 to complete the "D" shape:
ab_drop('b13', 4)

This solution satisfies both the stability constraint and the no boundary intrusion constraint. The resulting structure will resemble the character "D".
