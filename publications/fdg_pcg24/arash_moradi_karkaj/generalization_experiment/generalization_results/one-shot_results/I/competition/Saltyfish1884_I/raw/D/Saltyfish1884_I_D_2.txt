To generate a stable structure that resembles the letter "D", we need to consider the stability rules provided in the constraints. 

1. Place a b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. We can start by placing a b31 block on the bottom layer, centered at slot 9. 

ab_drop('b31', 9)

2. Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block, vertically centered at slot 9 to form the vertical stem of the "D". 

ab_drop('b13', 9)

3. Place another b31 block on top of the b13 block, horizontally aligned with the b31 block below, but shifted one slot to the right. 

ab_drop('b31', 8)

This will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "D". 

Note: Depending on the specific requirements of the block-stacking problem and the specific rules mentioned in the constraints, the exact configuration of the stable structure may vary. The example provided above is just one possible solution.
