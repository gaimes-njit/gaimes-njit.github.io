To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "D", we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks. 

First, let's consider the constraints mentioned in part 5:

5.1 Stability:
- We can start by dropping a b31 block on the solid base to prevent overhangs. The center of this block should be aligned with a slot on the base layer (layer 0).
- Next, we can drop a b13 block above the b31 block to form the vertical part of the "D" shape. The center of this block should also be aligned with a slot on the base layer.
- Finally, we can drop another b31 block on top of the b13 block to complete the horizontal part of the "D".

5.2 No boundary intrusion:
- To avoid intruding on the map's boundary, we need to make sure that the blocks are placed within the available slots. The slots range from 0 to 19.

Based on the above considerations, we can use the ab_drop() function to generate the structure that resembles the character "D" as follows:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop the first b31 block on slot 1 of the base layer
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Drop the b13 block above the b31 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop the second b31 block on top of the b13 block in slot 1

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "D" while meeting all the hard constraints.
