To generate a stable structure resembling the character "D" while meeting all constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.
2. Drop a b31 block at slot y=1 to form the base of the structure.
3. Drop a b13 block at slot y=1 on top of the base.
4. Drop another b31 block at slot y=1 on top of the previous block.
5. The resulting structure should resemble the character "D" with stable placement.

Here is the example code:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Drop a b31 block at slot y=1
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Step 3: Drop a b13 block at slot y=1
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Step 4: Drop another b31 block at slot y=1
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Step 5: Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "D" and meet all the given constraints.
