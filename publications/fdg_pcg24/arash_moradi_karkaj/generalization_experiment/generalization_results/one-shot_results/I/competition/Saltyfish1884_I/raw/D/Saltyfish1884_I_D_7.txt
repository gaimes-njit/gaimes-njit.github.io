To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "D" using the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Drop a b31 block at slot 2.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
This block will act as the vertical segment of the "D" character.

2. Drop a b13 block at slot 0, just to the left of the b31 block.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```
This block will act as the curved left part of the "D" character.

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 3, just to the right of the b31 block.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This block will act as the curved right part of the "D" character.

4. Drop a b31 block at slot 6, below the b31 and b13 blocks.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```
This block will act as the horizontal segment of the "D" character.

5. The resulting structure will resemble the character "D" and will meet all the hard constraints. The ab_drop() function has been used to place the blocks in the desired positions, maintaining stability and ensuring no boundary intrusion.

The final code to generate the "D" character structure would be:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

Note: The slot numbers and block types used in the example above may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
