To generate a structure that resembles the character "E" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Add the stable base blocks (b11 or b13) to the structure.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)  # Add a b11 block at slot 0 for stability
ab_drop('b11', 19) # Add a b11 block at slot 19 for stability
```

Step 3: Add the vertical block (b13) to create the central line of the "E".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 6)   # Add a b13 block at slot 6 for the central line
```

Step 4: Add the horizontal blocks (b31) to create the top and bottom parts of the "E".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Add a b31 block at slot 2 for the top part
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Add a b31 block at slot 10 for the top part
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Add a b31 block at slot 2 for the bottom part
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Add a b31 block at slot 10 for the bottom part
```

Step 5: Add stability blocks (b11 or b13) to prevent overhangs and add support.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Add a b11 block at slot 1 for stability
ab_drop('b11', 11)  # Add a b11 block at slot 11 for stability
ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Add a b11 block at slot 1 for stability
ab_drop('b11', 11)  # Add a b11 block at slot 11 for stability
ab_drop('b11', 7)   # Add a b11 block at slot 7 for stability
```

Step 6: Add more stability blocks to lower the risk of collapsing and connect the structure.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 5)   # Add a b11 block at slot 5 for stability and connection
ab_drop('b11', 15)  # Add a b11 block at slot 15 for stability and connection
ab_drop('b11', 5)   # Add a b11 block at slot 5 for stability and connection
ab_drop('b11', 15)  # Add a b11 block at slot 15 for stability and connection
```

After executing these steps, the structure grid will resemble the character "E" while satisfying all the hard constraints.
