To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "E", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping two b13 blocks aligned with the leftmost and rightmost slots (0 and 19).
   - Call the `ab_drop('b13', 0)` function to drop the left block.
   - Call the `ab_drop('b13', 19)` function to drop the right block.

2. Drop a b31 block aligned with the second slot from the left (slot 1) to connect the two vertical blocks.
   - Call the `ab_drop('b31', 1)` function to drop the block.

3. Drop a b11 block aligned with the second slot from the left (slot 1) in the third layer (layer 2) to form the horizontal upper part of the "E".
   - Call the `ab_drop('b11', 1)` function to drop the block.

4. Drop another b11 block aligned with the second slot from the left (slot 1) in the second layer (layer 1) to complete the vertical part of the "E".
   - Call the `ab_drop('b11', 1)` function to drop the block.

The final structure will resemble the character "E" and will meet all the hard constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.
