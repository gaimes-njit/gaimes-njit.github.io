To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "E" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability rules and ensure no boundary intrusion.

Step 1: Place the blocks in the bottom layer to form the base.
- Place a b31 block on the 1st slot.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot.
- Place a b13 block on the 15th slot.

Step 2: Build the middle section of the "E".
- Place a b31 block on the 1st slot, one layer above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, one layer above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, two layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, three layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, four layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, five layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, six layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, seven layers above the base.

Step 3: Complete the top section of the "E".
- Place a b31 block on the 1st slot, nine layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, nine layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, ten layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, eleven layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, twelve layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, thirteen layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, fourteen layers above the base.
- Place a b11 block on the 8th slot, fifteen layers above the base.

Note: The above steps assume that the block types b11, b31, and b13 are represented in the ab_drop() function as 'b11', 'b31', and 'b13' respectively.

The Python code to generate the structure resembling the character "E" would be:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Base - bottom layer, 1st slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Base - bottom layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b13', 15) # Base - bottom layer, 15th slot
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Middle section - second layer, 1st slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Middle section - third layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Middle section - fourth layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Middle section - fifth layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Middle section - sixth layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Middle section - seventh layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Middle section - eighth layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Middle section - ninth layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Top section - tenth layer, 1st slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Top section - eleventh layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Top section - twelfth layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Top section - thirteenth layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Top section - fourteenth layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Top section - fifteenth layer, 8th slot
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Top section - sixteenth layer, 8th slot

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "E" while meeting all hard constraints and avoiding boundary intrusion.
