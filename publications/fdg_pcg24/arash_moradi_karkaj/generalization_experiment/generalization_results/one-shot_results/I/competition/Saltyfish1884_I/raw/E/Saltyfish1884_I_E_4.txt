To generate a structure that resembles the character "E" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) to form the bottom horizontal line of the "E". This ensures stability and prevents overhangs.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Step 2: Place a vertical block at the center of the second slot from the left to form the middle vertical line of the "E". This also helps maintain stability.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Step 3: Place a horizontal block on top of the vertical block, positioned one slot to the right. This forms the top horizontal line of the "E".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Step 4: Place another vertical block on top of the previous horizontal block, positioned one slot to the right. This completes the right vertical line of the "E".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "E" and will meet all the hard constraints.

Note: The exact positions and order of the ab_drop() function calls may need to be adjusted depending on the desired appearance of the "E" and the stability requirements.
