To generate a structure resembling the character "E" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the bottom horizontal block (b31) at the leftmost slot (slot 0) to form the base of the "E". Use the ab_drop() function as follows:
   ab_drop('b31', 0)

2. Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the previous block, aligned with its center at slot 0. Use the ab_drop() function as follows:
   ab_drop('b13', 0)

3. Place the middle horizontal block (b31) on top of the previous block, aligned with its center at slot 0. Use the ab_drop() function as follows:
   ab_drop('b31', 0)

4. Place the top horizontal block (b31) on top of the previous block, aligned with its center at slot 0. Use the ab_drop() function as follows:
   ab_drop('b31', 0)

The final structure will resemble the character "E" and meet all the given constraints.
