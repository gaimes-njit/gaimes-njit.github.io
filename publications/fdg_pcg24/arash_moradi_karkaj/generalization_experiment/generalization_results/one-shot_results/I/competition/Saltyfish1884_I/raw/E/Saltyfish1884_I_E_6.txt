To generate a stable structure resembling the character "E" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Initializing the structure
Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Placing the base
To meet the stability constraint, we need to start by placing a solid base. We can achieve this by dropping a b11 block on the bottom layer. Use the ab_drop() function to place the b11 block at the center slot (slot 10):
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

Step 3: Placing the vertical bars
The "E" character has two vertical bars. To create these bars, we will use b13 blocks. Start by placing the left vertical bar on the leftmost slot (slot 0). Use the ab_drop() function to place the b13 block at the center slot (slot 0):
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```
Next, place the right vertical bar on the rightmost slot (slot 19). Use the ab_drop() function to place the b13 block at the center slot (slot 19):
```
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```

Step 4: Placing the horizontal bar
The "E" character has a horizontal bar connecting the two vertical bars. To create this bar, we will use a b31 block. Place the b31 block just above the base to ensure stability. Use the ab_drop() function to place the b31 block at the center slot (slot 10):
```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

The final structure resembling the character "E" will be generated by executing the above code step by step.
