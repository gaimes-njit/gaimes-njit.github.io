To generate a structure that resembles the character "E" while satisfying all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet.

2. Drop a b31 block at a suitable slot to form the vertical line of the "E". Since stability is crucial, we need to make sure the b31 block is placed on a solid base. We can achieve this by dropping a b11 block first at the desired slot and then dropping the b31 block above it. The code will be:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a b11 block as the base
   ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a b31 block above the base
   ```

3. Drop a b13 block at a suitable slot to form the top horizontal line of the "E". We need to make sure the b13 block is placed as low as possible to maintain stability. We can achieve this by first dropping a b11 block at the desired slot and then dropping the b13 block above it. The code will be:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a b11 block as the base for the top line
   ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a b13 block above the base for the top line
   ```

4. Drop another b13 block at a suitable slot to form the bottom horizontal line of the "E". Again, we need to make sure the b13 block is placed as low as possible for stability. We can achieve this by first dropping a b11 block at the desired slot and then dropping the b13 block above it. The code will be:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a b11 block as the base for the bottom line
   ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a b13 block above the base for the bottom line
   ```

5. The final structure will resemble the character "E" with three vertical lines of blocks. You can print the structure to visualize the result:
   ```
   for row in structure:
       print(' '.join(row))
   ```

Note: The slot numbers mentioned in the code examples are just placeholders. You may need to adjust the slot numbers based on your desired layout of the "E" character.
