To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "E", we need to plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks.

1. Drop the base blocks (b11 or b13) first to create a solid base. We can start by dropping a b13 block at the bottom layer (0).
ab_drop('b13', 4)

2. Add the vertical line of the "E" shape. Drop a b13 block at a suitable position to form the vertical line.
ab_drop('b13', 11)

3. Add the horizontal top line of the "E" shape. Drop a b31 block on top of the vertical line, starting from the leftmost slot to the rightmost slot.
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)

4. Add the horizontal middle line of the "E" shape. Drop a b31 block on top of the vertical line, aligning it with the horizontal top line.
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)

5. Add the horizontal bottom line of the "E" shape. Drop a b31 block on top of the vertical line, aligning it with the horizontal top line and leaving a space in the middle.
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)

The final structure will resemble the character "E" and meet all the hard constraints of stability. Note that the slot numbers may need adjustment depending on the desired position and width of the "E" shape.
