To generate a structure that resembles the character "E" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability and boundary constraints.

1. Stability:
Since a b31 block must be placed on a solid base, we need to start by placing a b31 block at the bottom layer, slot 1. This will serve as the base of the "E" structure.
Next, we need to ensure that the other blocks in the structure are placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing. We can accomplish this by dropping the blocks from the top down, starting with the topmost block.

2. Boundary Constraint:
To ensure that the structure does not intrude on the map's boundary, we need to ensure that the blocks are placed within suitable slots. We need to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost occupied slots of the structure as we build it.

Based on the above considerations, we can proceed with the following steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Place the base of the "E" structure by dropping a b31 block at the bottom layer, slot 1.
ab_drop('b31', 1)

Step 3: Update the leftmost and rightmost occupied slots.
leftmost_slot = 1
rightmost_slot = 1

Step 4: Place the horizontal bar of the "E" structure by dropping a b13 block at the second lowest layer, the same slot as the base block.
ab_drop('b13', 1)

Step 5: Update the leftmost and rightmost occupied slots.
leftmost_slot = min(leftmost_slot, 1)
rightmost_slot = max(rightmost_slot, 1)

Step 6: Place the top bar of the "E" structure by dropping a b31 block at the third lowest layer, the same slot as the base block.
ab_drop('b31', 1)

Step 7: Update the leftmost and rightmost occupied slots.
leftmost_slot = min(leftmost_slot, 1)
rightmost_slot = max(rightmost_slot, 1)

The final structure will resemble the character "E" and meet all hard constraints. The specific code may vary depending on the desired position and order of block placements.
