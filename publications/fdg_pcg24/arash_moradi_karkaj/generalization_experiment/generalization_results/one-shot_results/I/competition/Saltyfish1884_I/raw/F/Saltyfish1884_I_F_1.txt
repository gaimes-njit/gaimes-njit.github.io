To generate a structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Place the base of the structure by dropping a b11 block on layer 0 at the center slot:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', W//2)
   ```

3. Drop the first vertical block (b13) on the left side of the structure to form the vertical line of the "F":
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

4. Drop the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical line at the center slot:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', W//2)
   ```

5. Drop the second vertical block (b13) on the right side of the horizontal block to complete the "F":
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', W-1)
   ```

The above steps ensure that the blocks are placed in a stable manner, with b31 blocks always placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks), and the structure is not separated. The structure will resemble the character "F" and will satisfy the stability constraint.

Note: The specific slot numbers and order of dropping blocks can vary, as long as the resulting structure resembles the character "F" and meets all hard constraints.
