To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "F" using the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base block (b11) on the bottom layer at the center slot, ensuring stability.
```
ab_drop('b11', int(W/2))
```

Step 3: Place the first vertical block (b13) on top of the base block, at the same slot, ensuring stability.
```
ab_drop('b13', int(W/2))
```

Step 4: Place the top horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block, centered relative to the base block, ensuring stability.
```
ab_drop('b31', int(W/2))
```

Step 5: Place the bottom horizontal block (b31) on the bottom layer, centered relative to the base block, ensuring stability.
```
ab_drop('b31', int(W/2))
```

Step 6: Place the second vertical block (b13) on top of the bottom horizontal block, centered relative to the base block, ensuring stability.
```
ab_drop('b13', int(W/2))
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "F".
