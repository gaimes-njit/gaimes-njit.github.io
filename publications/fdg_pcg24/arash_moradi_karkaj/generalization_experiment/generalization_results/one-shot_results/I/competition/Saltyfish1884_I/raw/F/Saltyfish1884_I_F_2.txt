To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "F", we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Determine the dropping positions:
- Start by dropping the b31 block on the base (layer 0) at slot 1, as it needs to be placed on a solid base to prevent overhangs. Use the ab_drop('b31', 1) function to do this.
- Next, drop the b13 block on top of the previous block in slot 1. Use the ab_drop('b13', 1) function to do this.
- Finally, drop another b31 block on top of the previous block in slot 1. Use the ab_drop('b31', 1) function to do this.

2. Shape of the structure:
- After following the above dropping positions, the structure will resemble the character "F" with the b31 block forming the vertical part of the "F" and the b13 block forming the horizontal part.

3. Use ab_drop() function to generate the structure:
- Use the ab_drop() function with the appropriate block type and slot number to drop the blocks and form the structure.
- Here is the code to generate the structure:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all the hard constraints. The dropping positions and order have been determined using techniques from the block-stacking problem.
