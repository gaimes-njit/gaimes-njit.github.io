To generate a structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block, 'b31', at the appropriate slot to form the horizontal base of the "F" character. The goal is to ensure stability by placing it on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) and as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing. Let's assume we drop it in slot 5:

```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

3. Drop the second block, 'b13', above the top right corner of the base to form the vertical line of the "F" character. This block should also be placed as low as possible to maintain stability. Let's assume we drop it in slot 6:

```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

4. Drop the third block, 'b31', above the top left corner of the base to complete the horizontal line of the "F" character. This block should be placed as low as possible to maintain stability. Let's assume we drop it in slot 5:

```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

5. The resulting structure should now resemble the character "F" while meeting all the hard constraints. You can print the final structure to verify:

```
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The output will show a structure that resembles the character "F" and satisfies all the given constraints.

Note: The specific slot numbers used in this example are just for illustration purposes. You may need to adjust the slot numbers based on the desired position of the "F" character in the structure.
