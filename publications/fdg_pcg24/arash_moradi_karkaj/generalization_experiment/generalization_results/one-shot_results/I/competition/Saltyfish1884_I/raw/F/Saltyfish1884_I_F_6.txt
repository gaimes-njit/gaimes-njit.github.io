To generate a structure that resembles the character "F," we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
2. Place a b31 block on the base at slot 1 using the ab_drop() function.
3. Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block at slot 1 using the ab_drop() function.
4. Place another b31 block on top of the b13 block at slot 1 using the ab_drop() function.

This will create a structure resembling the character "F" while meeting the stability constraints. The final code will look like:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Note: The exact order and slot positions may vary depending on the specific implementation of the ab_drop() function and the desired structure.
