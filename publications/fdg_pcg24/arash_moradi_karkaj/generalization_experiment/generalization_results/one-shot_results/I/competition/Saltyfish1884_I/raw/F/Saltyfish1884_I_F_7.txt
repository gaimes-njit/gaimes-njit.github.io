To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the dropping position and order: We need to carefully determine where and in what order to drop the blocks to ensure stability. We can start by considering the stability rules mentioned in the constraints.

2. Consider stability rules: 

- A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. This means our bottom layer should consist of b11 or b13 blocks to provide a stable base.

- Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing. This means we should drop the blocks starting from the bottom layer and work our way up.

- The structure should not be separated. This means that the blocks should be placed in a way that they connect and form a solid structure without any gaps.

3. Determine the shape of the structure: In order to resemble the character "F", we can consider the outline shape of the letter. The "F" consists of a vertical line with a horizontal line crossing it at the top. We can plan our structure accordingly.

4. Use ab_drop() function to form the structure: Based on the determined dropping position and order, we can use the ab_drop() function to drop suitable blocks to form the structure that resembles the given character. We need to make sure to drop each block at the proper slot to ensure stability.

The specific code to generate the structure that resembles the character "F" will depend on the specific dropping positions and order determined based on the constraints and shape of the structure. The provided example code demonstrates dropping blocks to form the letter "I". We can modify and extend this code to generate a new structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all the given requirements.
