To generate a structure that resembles the character "F", we need to carefully consider the constraints and determine the order and positions of the block drops.

First, let's analyze the stability constraint:

1. A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. This means we need to first drop a b11 block at the center of the base.

To do this, we can use the ab_drop() function as follows:
ab_drop('b11', 9)

Next, let's consider the shape of the structure:

The character "F" consists of a vertical stroke and a horizontal stroke. We can represent it as follows:
  ###
  #
  #

To create this shape, we need to drop a b13 block on top of the b11 block to form the vertical stroke, and then drop a b31 block next to the vertical stroke to form the horizontal stroke.

To do this, we can use the ab_drop() function as follows:
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 7)

The final structure will resemble the character "F" and meet all the hard constraints.

Here is the complete Python code:
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
