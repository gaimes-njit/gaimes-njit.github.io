To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "G", we need to carefully follow the stability rules and constraints.

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid
```
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Step 2: Place the base blocks (b11 or b13)
Since stability requires a solid base for the structure, we need to place some base blocks first. Let's start with b11 blocks placed at the bottom row (layer 0) from slot 2 to 7.
```
for i in range(2, 8):
    ab_drop('b11', i)
```

Step 3: Place the vertical block (b13) for the main body of "G"
To form the main body of the "G", we can use a vertical block (b13) placed on top of the base blocks. Let's place it in slot 4, just above the center of the base blocks.
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal block (b31) for the top part of "G"
To complete the top part of the "G", we need a horizontal block (b31). Let's place it on top of the vertical block in slot 6.
```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

Step 5: Place the horizontal blocks (b31) for the middle and bottom parts of "G"
To form the middle and bottom parts of the "G", we can place two more horizontal blocks (b31) at the bottom part of the structure, slightly offset from the center. Let's place them in slots 2 and 8.
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

Step 6: Check stability and adjust if necessary
After placing all the blocks, it's important to check the stability of the structure. If any blocks are not stably placed or violate the stability rules, we can adjust their positions accordingly.

The final structure grid should resemble the character "G" and satisfy all the hard constraints.

Please note that the exact slot numbers and placements of blocks may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem. The above steps provide a general guideline for generating a stable structure that resembles the character "G".
