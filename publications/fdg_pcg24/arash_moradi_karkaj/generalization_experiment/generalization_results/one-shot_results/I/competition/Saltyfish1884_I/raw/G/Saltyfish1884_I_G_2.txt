To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "G" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully place blocks using the ab_drop() function. 

First, let's analyze the constraints:

5.1 Stability:
- A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
- Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
- Structure should not be separated.

5.2 No boundary intrusion:
- Blocks should not intrude on the mapâ€™s boundary, both W and H.

Based on these constraints, we can determine the shape of the structure that resembles the character "G". 

The structure should consist of the following blocks:
- Two b13 blocks placed vertically to form the vertical portion of "G".
- One b31 block placed horizontally on top of the b13 blocks to form the top portion of "G".
- Two b11 blocks placed on the sides to complete the shape of "G".

Now, let's use the ab_drop() function to place the blocks in the specified order to form the structure:

ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Drop the first b13 block in the middle slot
ab_drop('b11', 0)  # Drop the first b11 block on the left side
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop the b31 block on top of the b13 block
ab_drop('b11', 19) # Drop the second b11 block on the right side
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Drop the second b13 block in the middle slot

The final result will be a stable structure that resembles the character "G".
