To generate a structure that resembles the character "G" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. 

Step 1: Place the base
We start by placing a b11 block at the bottom layer, centered at slot 9. This will serve as the base for the structure.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

Step 2: Build the vertical pillar
Next, we need to build a vertical pillar using b13 blocks. Starting from the top layer and moving down, we place b13 blocks at the same slot (slot 9) to form a straight vertical line.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Step 3: Create the horizontal arm
To form the horizontal arm of the "G", we use a b31 block. We place it on top of the vertical pillar, centered at slot 9.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 4: Add support blocks
To ensure stability, we need to add support blocks below the horizontal arm. We can use b11 blocks for this purpose. Place one b11 block on each side of the vertical pillar, aligned with the bottom of the horizontal arm.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

Step 5: Close the loop
To satisfy the constraint that the structure should not be separated, we need to add blocks to close the loop. We can use b31 blocks for this purpose. Place one b31 block on each side of the horizontal arm, aligned with the top of the vertical pillar.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 15)
```

Step 6: Finalize the structure
To meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints, we can add additional support blocks below the loop and adjust the dropping positions as needed. The exact placement will depend on the specific requirements of the constraints.

The final code to generate the structure that resembles the character "G" while meeting all the constraints might look something like this:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 15)
```

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid ways to create a stable structure resembling the character "G" while meeting all the constraints.
