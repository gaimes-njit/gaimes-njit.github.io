To generate a stable structure resembling the character "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b11 block at the bottom center of the structure to act as the base:
ab_drop('b11', 9)

2. Place a b11 block on top of the base, slightly shifted to the right to create the top part of the "G":
ab_drop('b11', 10)

3. Place a b11 block on top of the previous block, slightly shifted to the right:
ab_drop('b11', 11)

4. Place a b31 block on top of the base, covering the left side of the structure to create the vertical part of the "G":
ab_drop('b31', 7)

5. Place a b31 block on top of the previous block, covering the right side of the structure:
ab_drop('b31', 13)

6. Place a b13 block on top of the base, covering the top part of the vertical section to complete the "G":
ab_drop('b13', 10)

The final structure will resemble the character "G" and meet all the given constraints.
