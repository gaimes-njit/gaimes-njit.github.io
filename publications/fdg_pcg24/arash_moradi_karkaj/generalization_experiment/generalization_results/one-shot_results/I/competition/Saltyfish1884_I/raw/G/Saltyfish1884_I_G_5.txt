To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "G", we need to carefully consider the placement of blocks in order to meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Stability Constraint: Place the blocks in a way that ensures stability and weight distribution.
- Place a b31 block on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks):
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
- Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block to form the vertical part of "G":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
- Place a b31 block on top of the b13 block to complete the horizontal part of "G":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Boundary Intrusion Constraint: Ensure that blocks do not intrude on the map's boundaries.
- Place the blocks closer to the left boundary (slot 1) to avoid intrusion on the right boundary.

The final code to generate the "G" structure while meeting all constraints would be:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This code will drop the appropriate blocks in the correct order and positions to form a stable "G" structure while satisfying all the given constraints.
