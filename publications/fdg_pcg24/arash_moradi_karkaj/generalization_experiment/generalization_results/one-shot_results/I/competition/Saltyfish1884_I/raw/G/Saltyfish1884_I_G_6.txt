To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "G" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability rules and constraints mentioned.

Step by step approach:
1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code.
2. Based on the stability rules, we can determine the slots and layers required to form a stable "G" structure.
3. Plan the dropping position and order of blocks to achieve stability.
4. Use the ab_drop() function to drop suitable blocks in the determined positions to form the "G" structure.

Considering the stability rules and constraints, here's an example plan to form a stable "G" structure:

1. Place a b31 block on layer 0 (base) at slot 4 to provide a solid base for the structure.
2. Place a b13 block on layer 1 at slot 4 to create the vertical part of the "G".
3. Place a b31 block on layer 3 at slot 3 to provide support for the upper part of the "G".
4. Place a b31 block on layer 4 at slot 5 to extend the "G" shape.
5. Place a b31 block on layer 5 at slot 3 to complete the horizontal part of the "G".
6. Place a b13 block on layer 5 at slot 7 to close the shape of the "G".

The Python code to generate this "G" structure would be:

ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 7)

Please note that this is just one example of how the "G" structure can be formed while meeting the hard constraints. The specific dropping positions and order may vary, but the stability and shape requirements should be considered while determining them.
