To generate a stable structure resembling the character "G" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step plan:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Determine the dropping position for each block:
- The first block to drop should be a b31 block to form the top horizontal stroke of the "G". Place it at slot 5 (centered horizontally).
- The second block to drop should be a b13 block to form the vertical stroke of the "G". Place it at slot 5 (centered horizontally).
- The third block to drop should be another b31 block to form the bottom horizontal stroke of the "G". Place it at slot 5 (centered horizontally).

3. Drop the blocks using the ab_drop() function in the determined order:
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)

4. The final structure grid will resemble the character "G". It will have a stable configuration and meet all the hard constraints.

Here is the Python code to achieve this:

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# drop the blocks to form the "G" structure
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
