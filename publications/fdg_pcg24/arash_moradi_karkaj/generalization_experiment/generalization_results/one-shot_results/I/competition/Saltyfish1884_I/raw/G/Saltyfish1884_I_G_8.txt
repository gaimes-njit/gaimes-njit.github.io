To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "G", we can follow the below steps:

Step 1: Place the bottom horizontal block of the "G" shape.
ab_drop('b31', 0)

Step 2: Place the vertical block of the "G" shape.
ab_drop('b13', 1)

Step 3: Place the top horizontal block of the "G" shape.
ab_drop('b31', 0)

Step 4: Place the two bottom horizontal blocks of the "G" shape (to complete the bottom part of the "G").
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)

Step 5: Place the top-right horizontal block of the "G" shape.
ab_drop('b31', 1)

Step 6: Place the top vertical block of the "G" shape.
ab_drop('b13', 1)

The final structure will resemble the character "G" and meet all the given constraints.
