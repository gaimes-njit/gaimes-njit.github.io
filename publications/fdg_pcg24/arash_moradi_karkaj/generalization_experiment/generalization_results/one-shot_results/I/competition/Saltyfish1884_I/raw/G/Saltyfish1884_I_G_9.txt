To generate a structure resembling the character "G" while meeting all the given constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop a b31 block in the middle-left slot to form the vertical part of the "G":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 3: Drop a b13 block on top of the previously dropped block, aligning it with the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Step 4: Drop another b31 block right next to the previously dropped block, aligning it with the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 5: Drop a b13 block on top of the last dropped block, aligning it with the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

By following these steps, you should be able to generate a stable structure resembling the character "G" that meets all the given constraints.

Note: The code provided here only shows the sequence of ab_drop() function calls to achieve the desired structure. You need to use these calls as a guide and implement the actual logic and algorithm to determine the dropping positions and order based on the block-stacking problem techniques.
