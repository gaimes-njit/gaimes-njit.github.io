To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H", we need to carefully consider the constraints and the shape of the structure.

First, let's analyze the shape of the character "H". It consists of three parts: two vertical bars on the sides and a horizontal bar in the center. The bottom layer will serve as the solid base. We can represent the character "H" using the following structure:
```
[[' ', 'b31', ' '],
 [' ', 'b31', ' '],
 [' ', 'b31', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', 'b31', ' '],
 [' ', 'b31', ' '],
 [' ', 'b31', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', 'b31', ' '],
 [' ', 'b31', ' '],
 [' ', 'b31', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', 'b13', ' '],
 [' ', 'b13', ' '],
 [' ', 'b13', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' ']]
```

Now, let's use the `ab_drop()` function to place the blocks in the correct slots to form the structure.

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop a b31 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop a b31 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop a b31 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop a b31 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop a b31 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop a b31 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop a b31 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Drop a b13 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Drop a b13 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Drop a b13 block in slot 1
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` function calls will result in a stable structure that resembles the character "H", while satisfying all the given constraints.

Note: The specific slots and drop positions have been determined based on the analysis of the shape and constraints. However, there may be multiple valid solutions that meet the requirements.
