To generate a stable structure resembling the character "H", we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid.
- Use the provided code snippet to initialize an empty grid with the size WxH.

Step 2: Place the base.
- Use the ab_drop() function to drop a b11 block at the bottom layer, centered at slot 9 (W/2).
- This ensures a stable base for the structure.

Step 3: Place the vertical blocks (b13) to form the legs of the "H".
- Use the ab_drop() function to drop two b13 blocks at the bottom layer, centered at slots 6 and 12.
- These blocks will serve as the legs of the "H".

Step 4: Place the horizontal block (b31) to form the crossbar of the "H".
- Use the ab_drop() function to drop a b31 block at the second from bottom layer, centered at slot 9.
- This block will form the crossbar of the "H".

The final Python code to generate the "H" structure would be:

---
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Place the base
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Place the legs
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 12)

# Place the crossbar
ab_drop('b31', 9)
---

This code will result in a stable structure that resembles the character "H", while satisfying all the given hard constraints.
