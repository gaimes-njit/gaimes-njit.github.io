To generate a stable structure resembling the character "H" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.
2. Drop a b31 block at slot 1 to form the left vertical part of the "H".
3. Drop a b13 block at slot 1 to connect the left vertical part to the base.
4. Drop another b31 block at slot 1 to complete the left side of the "H".
5. Drop a b31 block at slot 5 to form the horizontal part of the "H".
6. Drop a b31 block at slot 9 to complete the right side of the "H".

The Python code to generate this structure is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

After executing this code, the structure will resemble the character "H" and satisfy all hard constraints. Note that the specific order and position of dropping the blocks is crucial to ensure stability and meeting the constraints.
