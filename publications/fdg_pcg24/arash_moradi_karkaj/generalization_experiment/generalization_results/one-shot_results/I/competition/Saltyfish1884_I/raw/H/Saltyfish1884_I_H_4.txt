To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Drop the bottom part of the "H" using the `ab_drop()` function. This consists of two `b13` blocks on slots 1 and 2.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Drop the horizontal bar of the "H" using the `ab_drop()` function. This is a `b31` block that should be placed on top of the previously dropped blocks. We can align its center with slot 1.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Drop the top part of the "H" using the `ab_drop()` function. This consists of two `b13` blocks on slots 1 and 2. The center of these blocks should align with the center of the previously dropped block.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "H" and satisfy all hard constraints of stability.
