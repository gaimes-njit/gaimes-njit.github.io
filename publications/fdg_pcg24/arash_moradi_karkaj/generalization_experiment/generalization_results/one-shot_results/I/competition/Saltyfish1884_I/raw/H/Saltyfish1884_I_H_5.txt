To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all the given constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks using the ab_drop() function.

Here's a step-by-step approach to generate the structure:

1. Place the base block (b11) at the center slot (slot 10) of the bottom layer (layer 0) using the ab_drop('b11', 10) function.

2. Place the vertical blocks (b13) on both sides of the base block. Drop one b13 block at slot 8 and another b13 block at slot 12 using the ab_drop('b13', y) function.

3. Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the base block and vertical blocks. Drop the b31 block at slot 10 using the ab_drop('b31', 10) function.

The complete code to generate the structure would be:

```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

This code will generate a stable structure resembling the character "H" while satisfying the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
