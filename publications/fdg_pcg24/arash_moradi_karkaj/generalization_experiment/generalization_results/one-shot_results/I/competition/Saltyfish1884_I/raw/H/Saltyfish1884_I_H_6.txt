To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H" while satisfying all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the placement order and positions of the blocks. 

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Based on the stability constraint, we can start by placing a b31 block centered at slot 0 or 1 to serve as the base, ensuring it is placed as low as possible:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Next, we can place a b13 block centered at slot 1 to connect to the base:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Finally, we can place another b31 block centered at slot 1 on top of the previous blocks to complete the "H" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The resulting structure should resemble the character "H" and satisfy the stability constraint.

Note: The actual code to generate the structure will depend on the implementation details and the exact requirements of the problem. The provided example demonstrates the basic steps to generate the desired structure, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific environment and constraints.
