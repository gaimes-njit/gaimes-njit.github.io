To generate a structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is one possible sequence of ab_drop() function calls to achieve the desired structure:

ab_drop('b13', 0) # Place the first vertical block at slot 0
ab_drop('b31', 0) # Place the horizontal block on top of the vertical block at slot 0
ab_drop('b11', 0) # Place the square block on top of the horizontal block at slot 0
ab_drop('b13', 3) # Place the second vertical block at slot 3
ab_drop('b31', 0) # Place the horizontal block on top of the second vertical block at slot 0
ab_drop('b11', 6) # Place the square block on top of the horizontal block at slot 6

The resulting structure will resemble the character "H" and meet all the hard constraints.
