To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the second slot to form the left vertical line of the "H":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Drop a b13 block at the second slot to connect the left vertical line with the horizontal line of the "H":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Drop another b31 block at the second slot to complete the right vertical line of the "H":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "H" and meet all the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
