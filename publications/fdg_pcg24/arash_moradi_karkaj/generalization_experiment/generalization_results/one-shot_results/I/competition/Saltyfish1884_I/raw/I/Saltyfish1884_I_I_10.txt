To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to strategically use the ab_drop() function to place the blocks in a stable and balanced manner.

Based on the stability constraints, we can determine that the base of the structure should consist of two b11 blocks placed side by side. This will provide a solid foundation for the vertical blocks.

To form the vertical part of the "I" shape, we can use two b13 blocks stacked on top of each other. These blocks should be placed on the base, centered in the available slots. For example:

ab_drop('b11', 7)  # first b11 block on the base
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # second b11 block on the base
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # first b13 block on top of base
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # second b13 block on top of first b13

This arrangement ensures stability by fulfilling the stability rule of placing a b31 block on a solid base. The blocks are also placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.

Once the blocks are dropped according to the above code, the structure will resemble the character "I" in the correct order and position.

To visualize the final structure, you can print the 'structure' list after the blocks have been dropped:

for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))

This will display the grid with the blocks representing the character "I".
