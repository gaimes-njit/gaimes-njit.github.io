To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve the desired structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code.

2. Start by dropping a b31 block on slot 1, as it is the closest slot to the center of the structure.

3. Next, drop a b13 block on slot 1 to form the center column of the "I".

4. Finally, drop another b31 block on slot 1 to complete the structure.

The Python code to achieve this would be:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure formed by these blocks will resemble the character "I".
