To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" using the ab_drop() function, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at slot number 1:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

3. Next, drop a b13 block at slot number 1:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

4. Finally, drop another b31 block at slot number 1:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

The final structure will resemble the character "I" and satisfy the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Note: The provided code is just an example. For different block types or slot positions, you may need to adjust the arguments passed to the ab_drop() function accordingly.
