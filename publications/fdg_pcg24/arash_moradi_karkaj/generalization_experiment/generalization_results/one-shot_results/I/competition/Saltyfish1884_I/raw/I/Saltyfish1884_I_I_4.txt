To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" using the ab_drop() function and meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Firstly, initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Next, we will consider the stability constraints. According to the stability rules:
- The first block should be a b31 block placed on the solid base. To achieve this, we will drop a b31 block at slot 9.
- The second block should be a b13 block placed on the base to provide support and prevent overhangs. We will drop a b13 block at slot 9.
- The third block should be another b31 block placed on the base. We will drop a b31 block at slot 9.

The code for dropping the blocks to meet the stability constraints would be:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Now, let's consider the boundary intrusion constraint. We need to ensure that no blocks intrude on the map's boundaries.

Since we are placing the blocks at slot 9, we can see that they do not intrude on the sides (W boundary). However, the top boundary (H boundary) constraint is not met. To meet this constraint, we can perform the following:
- Drop a b11 block at slot 9, just above the third block.
- Drop a b11 block at slot 10, next to the previous block.
- Drop another b11 block at slot 11, next to the previous block.

The updated code would be:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

Now, the resulting structure will have a stable "I" shape and will meet both the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
