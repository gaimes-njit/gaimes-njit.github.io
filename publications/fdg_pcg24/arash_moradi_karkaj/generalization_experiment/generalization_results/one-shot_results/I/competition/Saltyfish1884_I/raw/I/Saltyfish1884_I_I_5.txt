To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
We start by initializing the structure as a WxH grid using the provided code snippet.

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping positions:
We need to determine the dropping positions for each block type (b31 and b13) to ensure stability and meet the constraints. The dropping positions should follow the rules mentioned in the stability constraint.

3. Generate the structure:
Using the ab_drop() function, drop the blocks in the determined positions to form the structure that resembles the character "I". Use the ab_drop() function in the required order to achieve the desired outcome.

Example code to generate a structure that resembles the character "I":

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This code will drop the blocks in the required positions to form a stable structure that resembles the character "I".
