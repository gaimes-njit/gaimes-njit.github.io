To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the base block (b11) at the bottom layer (layer 0) in the center slot (slot 9).
   ab_drop('b11', 9)

Step 2: Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the base block, aligned with the center slot (slot 9).
   ab_drop('b13', 9)

Step 3: Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block, aligned with the center slot (slot 9).
   ab_drop('b31', 9)

Step 4: Place another vertical block on top of the horizontal block, aligned with the center slot (slot 9).
   ab_drop('b13', 9)

The final structure will resemble the character "I", with the base block at the bottom and two vertical blocks stacked on top of each other in the center.
