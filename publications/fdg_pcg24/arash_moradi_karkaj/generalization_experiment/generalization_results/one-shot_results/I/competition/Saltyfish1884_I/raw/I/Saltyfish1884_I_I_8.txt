To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" while satisfying all hard constraints, we need to carefully determine the dropping positions and order of the blocks.

Step 1: Determine the dropping position and order
To meet the stability constraint, we should start by placing a solid base at the bottom of the structure. We can achieve this by dropping a b11 block at the center slot (y = 9) on layer 0.

Step 2: Place the vertical blocks
Next, we need to add two vertical blocks (b13) on top of the base block. To meet the stability constraint, we should place these blocks as low as possible. We can achieve this by dropping the first b13 block at the center slot (y = 9) on layer 3. Then, we can drop the second b13 block at the center slot (y = 9) on layer 6.

Step 3: Place the horizontal block
Finally, we need to add a horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical blocks. We should place this block on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. We can achieve this by dropping the b31 block at the center slot (y = 9) on layer 12.

Step 4: Generate the Python code
Based on the above steps, the Python code to generate the structure that resembles the character "I" would be:

ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop the base block at the center slot on layer 0
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop the first vertical block at the center slot on layer 3
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop the second vertical block at the center slot on layer 6
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop the horizontal block on the solid base at the center slot on layer 12
