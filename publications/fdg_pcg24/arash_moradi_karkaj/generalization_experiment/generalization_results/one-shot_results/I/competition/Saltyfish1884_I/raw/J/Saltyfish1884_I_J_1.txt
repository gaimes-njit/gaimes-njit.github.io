To create a stable structure that resembles the character "J" using the ab_drop() function and meet all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b31 block on the solid base to form the vertical line of the "J" character:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block to complete the vertical line and form the hook of the "J" character:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Place another b31 block on top of the hook to extend it horizontally:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

5. Place a b11 block on top of the hook's extension to complete the horizontal line of the "J" character:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 12)
```

By following these steps, the ab_drop() function will place the blocks in a stable and proper manner to create a structure that resembles the character "J" while satisfying all the hard constraints.
