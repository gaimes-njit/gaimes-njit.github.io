To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "J," we can follow the following step-by-step approach:

Step 1: Initialize the structure of the map as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Step 2: Start by placing a b31 block on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. In this case, we will place it at slot 9 to ensure stability.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 3: Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block. This will create the vertical line shape of the "J" character. We will place it at slot 9 for stability.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Step 4: Place another b31 block on top of the b13 block. This will create the upper horizontal line shape of the "J" character. Again, we will place it at slot 9 for stability.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 5: Finally, the structure will resemble the character "J" as desired.

The final code will look like this:
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "J" while meeting all the hard constraints.
