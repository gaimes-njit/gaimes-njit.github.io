To generate a stable structure resembling the character "J" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the constraints and determine the order and position of the block drops.

Based on the stability constraints, we can start by placing a b31 block on the base to create a solid foundation. We can then drop a b13 block on top of the b31 block to extend the structure vertically. Finally, we can drop another b31 block on top of the b13 block to complete the shape of the character "J".

Here is the code to generate the structure:

ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)

This code represents the order of block drops to create a stable structure resembling the character "J".
