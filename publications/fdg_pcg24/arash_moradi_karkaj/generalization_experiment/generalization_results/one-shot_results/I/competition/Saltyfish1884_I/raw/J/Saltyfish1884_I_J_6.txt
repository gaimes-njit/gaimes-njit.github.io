Based on the given constraints and goals, we can follow the steps below to generate a structure that resembles the character "J":

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Step 2: Start by dropping a b11 block at the bottom left slot to form the base.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

Step 3: Drop a b31 block on top of the base to form the horizontal part of "J".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 4: Drop a b13 block on top of the horizontal part to form the vertical part of "J".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Step 5: Drop another b31 block on top of the vertical part to extend the horizontal part of "J".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Step 6: The structure now resembles the character "J" and meets all the hard constraints. You can check the structure by printing it:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The final result should be a structure that resembles the character "J" and meets all the given requirements.
