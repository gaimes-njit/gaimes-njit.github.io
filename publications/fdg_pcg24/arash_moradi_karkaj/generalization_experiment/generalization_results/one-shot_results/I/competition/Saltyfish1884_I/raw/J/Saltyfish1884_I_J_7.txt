To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "J", we can follow these steps:

1. Implement the stability rule that a b31 block must be placed on a solid base. We can achieve this by first dropping a b11 block in the center slot (slot 10) to create a base.

2. Place a b31 block on top of the base. Since the b31 block has a width of 3 units, we need to align its center with the center slot (slot 10) to ensure stability. We can achieve this by dropping the b31 block in slot 9.

3. Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block. Since the b13 block has a height of 3 units, we need to align its center with the center slot (slot 10). We can achieve this by dropping the b13 block in slot 10.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create another layer on top of the existing structure. This will create the protruding part of the "J" character.

5. Finally, repeat steps 2 and 3 once more to create the top layer of the "J" character.

The Python code to generate the structure that resembles the character "J" is as follows:

---
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
---

This code will vertically drop the blocks in the appropriate positions to form a stable structure that resembles the character "J".
