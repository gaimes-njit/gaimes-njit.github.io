To generate a structure that resembles the character "J" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

The first step is to determine the dropping position and order of the blocks. Since we want to create a structure that resembles the letter "J," we can start by dropping the b31 block vertically at slot 1. This creates the vertical part of the letter. Next, we can drop the b13 block vertically at slot 1, aligning it with the top of the previously dropped block. This creates the top horizontal part of the letter. Lastly, we can drop another b31 block vertically at slot 1, aligning it with the bottom of the previously dropped b31 block. This creates the bottom horizontal part of the letter.

Using the ab_drop() function, the Python code to generate the structure can be written as follows:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Note: The final result may vary slightly depending on the starting empty structure.
