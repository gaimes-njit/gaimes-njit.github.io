To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "J" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code snippet:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop a b31 block on the left side of the structure to create the base:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Drop a b31 block on top of the base, aligned with the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

4. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous two blocks, aligned with the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

5. Drop a b13 block next to the first column of the previous three blocks, aligned with the base:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

6. Drop a b13 block on top of the previous four blocks, aligned with the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

7. Drop a b13 block on top of the previous five blocks, aligned with the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

The final structure should resemble the character "J", with a stable configuration and satisfying all the hard constraints.

Note: The specific dropping positions and order described above ensure stability and the absence of boundary intrusion, meeting the provided constraints. However, there might be alternative solutions that also fulfill these requirements.
