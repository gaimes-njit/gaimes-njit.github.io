To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K", we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here's a step-by-step approach:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the first b31 block to form the horizontal bar of the "K". Place it at the bottom layer (layer 0) and align its center at slot 9.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 3: Drop the second b31 block to form the right vertical bar of the "K". Place it above the horizontal bar, aligning its center with slot 9.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 4: Drop the b13 block to form the diagonal part of the "K". Place it on the left side of the horizontal bar, aligning its center with slot 6.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

Step 5: Drop the third b31 block to complete the left vertical bar of the "K". Place it above the diagonal part, aligning its center with slot 3.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

After executing these steps, the structure will resemble the character "K" and meet all the hard constraints of stability. The code will look like this:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

You can modify the drop positions and order if you want to achieve a different structure that still resembles the character "K" while meeting all the given requirements.
