To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully consider the constraints and plan our steps accordingly:

Step 1: Initialize the empty structure grid
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) to form a stable base
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will create a stable structure with a solid base.

Step 3: Place the upper horizontal block (b31) and the vertical block (b13) to form the two vertical strokes of the "K"
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Step 4: Place the top horizontal block (b31) to complete the top stroke of the "K"
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 5: Place the diagonal blocks (b11) to connect the two vertical strokes with the top stroke
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "K". These steps ensure stability by placing the blocks according to the stability rules and avoid intrusion into the map's boundary.

You can further customize the positions and order of the blocks to adjust the appearance of the "K" structure based on your requirements.
