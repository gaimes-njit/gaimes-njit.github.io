In order to generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks.

First, let's analyze the stability constraints:
5.1.1 A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
5.1.2 Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
5.1.3 Structure should not be separated.

Based on the shape of the character "K", we can divide it into three main parts: the vertical stem, the horizontal bar, and the diagonal bar.

To meet constraint 5.1.1, we should start by placing a b13 block as the base. Then, we can drop a b31 block on top of the base to create the vertical stem. This will also satisfy constraint 5.1.2 by placing the blocks as low as possible.

Next, we need to create the horizontal bar. To satisfy constraint 5.1.3 and ensure stability, we can drop a b31 block on top of the vertical stem, aligned with the center of the stem.

Finally, to create the diagonal bar, we can drop another b31 block diagonally on top of the horizontal bar, aligned with the center of the bar.

Here is the code to generate the structure that resembles the character "K" while meeting the constraints:

# initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# drop the blocks to form the structure
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # place the base
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # place the vertical stem
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # place the horizontal bar
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # place the diagonal bar

The final structure will resemble the character "K" and meet all the hard constraints.
