Based on the given goal of creating a structure that resembles the character "K" and the constraints provided, we can follow these steps to build the structure:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop a b31 block at slot 1, aligning its center:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 1, aligning its center. This block will be placed on top of the previous b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Drop another b31 block at slot 1, aligning its center. This block will be placed on top of the previous b13 block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "K" and meet the stability constraints.
