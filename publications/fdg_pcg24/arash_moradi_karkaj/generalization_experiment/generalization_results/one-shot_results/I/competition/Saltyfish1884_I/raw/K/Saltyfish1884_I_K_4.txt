To generate a structure that resembles the character "K" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability rules and the shape of the structure. We will go step by step to achieve this.

Step 1: Place the base
We start by placing a b11 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) in the center slot (slot 10). This will serve as the base for the structure.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

Step 2: Place the vertical part
Next, we place a b13 block above the base, centered on the same slot (slot 10). This will form the vertical part of the "K".

```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

Step 3: Place the horizontal part
Finally, we place two b31 blocks on either side of the vertical part, slightly lowered to reduce the risk of collapsing. The slots used for the horizontal blocks will depend on the desired width and spacing of the character "K".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "K" and will satisfy all the hard constraints.

Putting it all together, the Python code to generate the "K" structure would be:

```python
# Step 1: Place the base
ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Step 2: Place the vertical part
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Step 3: Place the horizontal part
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

Note: The specific slot numbers used for the horizontal blocks (slots 8 and 12) are just an example. You can adjust them according to your desired width and spacing for the character "K".
