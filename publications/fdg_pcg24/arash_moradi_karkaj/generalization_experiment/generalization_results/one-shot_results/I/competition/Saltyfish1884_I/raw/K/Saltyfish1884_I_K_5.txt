To generate a structure that resembles the character "K" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

Step 1: Initialize the structure
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the first b13 block
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This block will serve as the vertical stem of the "K" character.

Step 3: Drop the second b13 block
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This block will be placed next to the first block to complete the vertical stem.

Step 4: Drop the b31 block on top of the vertical stem
```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```
This block will create the horizontal arm of the "K" character.

Step 5: Drop a b13 block at the bottom of the arm
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```
This block will be placed below the horizontal arm to complete the "K" shape.

The resulting structure will resemble the character "K" and meet all the hard constraints. You can adjust the slot numbers in the ab_drop() function calls to fine-tune the position of the blocks if needed.
