To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K", we can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Add the first vertical block (b13) in the middle of the structure.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

Step 3: Add two horizontal blocks (b31) on top of the vertical block, forming the top part of the "K".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

Step 4: Add a vertical block (b13) on the left side of the vertical block, forming the middle part of the "K".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

Step 5: Add another vertical block (b13) on the right side of the vertical block, forming the right side of the "K".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 13)
```

Step 6: Add a horizontal block (b31) on top of the left vertical block, completing the left side of the "K".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

Step 7: Add a horizontal block (b31) on top of the right vertical block, completing the right side of the "K".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "K" and will meet all the hard constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.
