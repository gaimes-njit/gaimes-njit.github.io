To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Define the goal: The goal is to form a structure that resembles the character "K".

2. Initialize the structure: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet.

3. Drop the blocks following the stability rules: Start by dropping a b31 block on the solid base (layer 0) at slot 1 using the ab_drop() function. 
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

4. Drop the remaining blocks: Next, drop a b13 block on the same slot (slot 1) to form the vertical part of the "K".
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

5. Continue dropping blocks: Drop another b31 block on slot 1 to complete the horizontal part of the "K".
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

6. Verify the structure: Check if the resulting structure resembles the character "K" and meets all the hard constraints. Adjust the dropping position or order if necessary.

Run the code outlined in steps 3-5 using the provided ab_drop() function to generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K".
