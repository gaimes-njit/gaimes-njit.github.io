To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty 20x16 grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Determine the dropping position and order of the blocks by analyzing the stability rules and constraints:
   - Start by dropping a b31 block on the base (layer 0) at slot 1 using the ab_drop() function:
     ```python
     ab_drop('b31', 1)
     ```

   - Drop a b13 block on top of the previous block at slot 1:
     ```python
     ab_drop('b13', 1)
     ```

   - Drop another b31 block on top of the previous block at slot 1:
     ```python
     ab_drop('b31', 1)
     ```

3. The final structure will resemble the character "K" with the blocks placed in a stable manner.

The complete Python code to generate the structure can be written as:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This code will create a stable structure that resembles the character "K" while satisfying all the given constraints.
