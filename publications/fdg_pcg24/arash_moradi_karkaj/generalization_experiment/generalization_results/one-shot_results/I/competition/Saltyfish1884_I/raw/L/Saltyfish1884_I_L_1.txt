To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L", we need to carefully choose the dropping positions and order of the blocks. 

First, let's consider the stability constraints. According to the stability rules:
1) We need to start with a solid base. So, we can drop a b11 block to the bottom layer, aligned with slot 1. This will act as the base for our structure.
2) Next, we can drop a b13 block on top of the base, aligned with slot 1. This will provide support for the upper part of the structure.
3) Finally, we can drop a b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with slot 1. This will complete the structure and ensure stability.

Next, let's consider the no boundary intrusion constraint. We need to ensure that the structure does not intrude on the map's boundary. Since the width of the blocks is smaller than the width of the map, this constraint is automatically met.

Using the ab_drop() function, we can generate the stable structure that resembles the character "L" as follows:

ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)

This code will drop the blocks in the specified order and positions to form the desired structure.
