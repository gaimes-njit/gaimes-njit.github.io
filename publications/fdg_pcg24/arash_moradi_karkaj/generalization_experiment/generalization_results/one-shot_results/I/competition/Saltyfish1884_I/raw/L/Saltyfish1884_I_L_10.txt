In order to generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop blocks to form the structure. We need to carefully determine the dropping position and order to meet the stability constraints.

3. Based on the stability constraints:
   - Place a b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) at a suitable slot to prevent overhangs.
   - Place blocks as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
   - Ensure that the structure is not separated.

4. Determine the appropriate dropping positions and block types to form the structure that resembles the character "L". 

For example, to generate a structure that resembles the character "L" using the `ab_drop()` function, you can use the following code:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

This code will place a b31 block on the solid base at slot 1, followed by placing four b11 blocks next to each other to form the vertical part of the "L" shape.

Note: The given code is just an example and the dropping positions and block types may vary based on the specific requirements and constraints of the character "L".
