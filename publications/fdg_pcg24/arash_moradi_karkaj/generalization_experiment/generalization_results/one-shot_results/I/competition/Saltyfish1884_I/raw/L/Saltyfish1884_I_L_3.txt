To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L", we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH using the provided map initialization code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping positions and order of the blocks by considering the stability constraints.

3. Start by placing a b31 block on top of a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) at slot 0. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block at the appropriate position:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

4. Next, place a b11 block on top of the previous block at slot 0 to prevent overhangs:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

5. Now, we need to add a vertical block (b13) to complete the "L" shape. Place it on top of the b11 block at slot 0:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

6. To meet the stability constraint of placing blocks as low as possible, we can drop another b31 block on top of the vertical block at slot 0:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

7. Finally, we can drop a b13 block next to the existing structure to complete the "L" shape. Place it at slot 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "L" and meet all the given requirements.
