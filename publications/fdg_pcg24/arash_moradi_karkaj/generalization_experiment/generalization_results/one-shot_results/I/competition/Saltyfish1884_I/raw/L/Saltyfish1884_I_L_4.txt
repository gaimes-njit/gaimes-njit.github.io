To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L", we can follow the step-by-step process outlined in the instructions. Here is one possible solution:

1. First, initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Place a b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Place a b13 block below the previous block to create the vertical part of the "L":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Place another b31 block above the first block to complete the horizontal part of the "L":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "L":
```
    ____           _
   |    |         | |
   |    |         | |
   |____|         | |
                 | |
                 | |
                 |_|
```

Note: This is just one possible solution. Depending on the starting position and order of dropping the blocks, there may be alternative ways to generate a stable structure resembling the character "L".
