To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Place the first block (b11) on the base (layer 0) at slot 0:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

3. Place the second block (b13) on top of the previous block at slot 0:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Place the third block (b31) on top of the previous block at slot 0:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

5. Place the fourth block (b31) on top of the previous block at slot 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

6. Place the fifth block (b31) on top of the previous block at slot 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

7. Place the sixth block (b31) on top of the previous block at slot 3:
```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "L". Please note that the positioning and order of block placement are crucial for stability. Make sure to carefully adjust the slot numbers to ensure proper weight distribution and prevent collapse.

Here is the final code:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```
