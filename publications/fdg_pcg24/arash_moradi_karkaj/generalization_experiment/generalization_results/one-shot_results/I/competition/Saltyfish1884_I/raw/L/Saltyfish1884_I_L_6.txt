To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks. 

First, let's analyze the constraints:

Constraint 5.1 Stability: 
- A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
- Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
- Structure should not be separated.

Constraint 5.2 No boundary intrusion:
- Blocks should not intrude on the map's boundary.

Based on these constraints, we can devise a step-by-step plan:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13 blocks) on the bottom layer to form a stable base:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

3. Place the b31 block on top of the base to form the vertical part of the "L":
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Place the top block (b11 or b13 block) to complete the horizontal part of the "L":
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "L" and meet all the given requirements. Note that this is just one possible solution, and depending on the specific requirements or preferences, other variations may be considered.
