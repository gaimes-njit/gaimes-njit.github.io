To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L", we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b11 block at slot 0 on layer 0 to create a solid base.
   ab_drop('b11', 0)

2. Place a b31 block on top of the base, aligned with the center slot (slot 9).
   ab_drop('b31', 9)

3. Place a b13 block on top of the previous block, aligned with the center slot (slot 9).
   ab_drop('b13', 9)

4. Place a b31 block on top of the previous block, aligned with the center slot (slot 9).
   ab_drop('b31', 9)

After executing these steps, the structure will resemble the character "L" and meet all the hard constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.

The final Python code will be:

---
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
