To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b31 block on layer 0 at slot 0 to create a solid base:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Place a b13 block on layer 1 at slot 0 to extend the base vertically:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Place another b31 block on layer 1 at slot 0 to create the horizontal part of the "L" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

5. Place a b11 block on layer 2 at slot 2 to complete the vertical part of the "L" shape:
```
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

6. The resulting structure should resemble the character "L". You can print the structure to visualize the final result:
```
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The final result will look like this:
```
      b31    
b13   b31    
b11   b11
```
Note that the exact positions of the blocks may vary depending on the stability rules applied by the ab_drop() function.
