To generate a structure that resembles the character "L" while meeting all constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure grid as an empty WxH grid.

2. Place the first block, 'b31', at slot 1 by using the ab_drop() function: ab_drop('b31', 1).

3. Place the second block, 'b13', at slot 1 by using the ab_drop() function: ab_drop('b13', 1).

4. Place the third block, 'b31', at slot 1 by using the ab_drop() function: ab_drop('b31', 1).

The code snippet will look like this:

ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)

This will result in a structure that resembles the character "L", satisfying the stability constraint and not intruding on the boundary. You can adjust the slot numbers and block types as needed to create different structures.
