To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Determine the dropping positions for each block

To meet the stability constraint, we need to carefully drop blocks in a specific order and position.

Based on the given goal, the M shape can be divided into three parts: two b31 blocks on the sides and one b13 block in the middle. We will drop each block one by one to ensure stability.

Step 3: Drop the first b31 block

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 4: Drop the b13 block

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Step 5: Drop the second b31 block

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "M".

Note: This is just an example to demonstrate the process. The exact positions and order of the drops may vary depending on the specific requirements for stability and boundary intrusion.
