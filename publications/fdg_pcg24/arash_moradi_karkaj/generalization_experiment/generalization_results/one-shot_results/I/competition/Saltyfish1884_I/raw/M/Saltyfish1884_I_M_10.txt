To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M" while meeting all the hard constraints, we should follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping position and order of the blocks representing the character "M" by analyzing its shape. In this case, we can start from the bottom-left point of the "M" and go upwards while considering the stability rules.

3. Start by placing a b13 block (vertical block with a width of 1 and a height of 3) at the bottom-left slot of the structure. This will serve as the base for the entire structure. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block in the correct position:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Next, place a b31 block (horizontal block with a width of 3 and a height of 1) above the base block. This will form the middle part of the "M". Drop it in the same slot as the previous block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

5. Finally, place another b13 block above the previous block, but in the slot to the right. This will complete the structure and form the top part of the "M":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

After executing these steps, the `structure` grid will contain the stable structure that resembles the character "M" while satisfying all the hard constraints.
