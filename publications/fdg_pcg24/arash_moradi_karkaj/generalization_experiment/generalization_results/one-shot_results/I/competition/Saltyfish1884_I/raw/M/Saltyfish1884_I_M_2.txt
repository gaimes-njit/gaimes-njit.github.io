To generate a stable structure resembling the character "M" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here's one possible step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize the structure:
```
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) to create a solid foundation:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop a base block at slot 9
ab_drop('b11', 10) # Drop a base block at slot 10
```

3. Build the left and right sides of the "M" structure:
```
ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Drop a horizontal block at slot 7 (left side)
ab_drop('b31', 12)  # Drop a horizontal block at slot 12 (right side)
```

4. Connect the left and right sides with a vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)   # Drop a vertical block at slot 9 (center)
```

5. Add stability to the structure by placing base blocks below the left and right sides:
```
ab_drop('b11', 7)   # Drop a base block below the left side (slot 7)
ab_drop('b11', 12)  # Drop a base block below the right side (slot 12)
```

This step-by-step approach creates a stable structure resembling the character "M" while satisfying the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Note: The specific slot numbers and block types used in this example may vary depending on the desired shape and dimensions of the "M" structure.
