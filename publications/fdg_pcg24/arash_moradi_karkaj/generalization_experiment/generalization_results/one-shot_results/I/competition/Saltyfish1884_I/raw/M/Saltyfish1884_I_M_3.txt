To generate a structure that resembles the character "M" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks.

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Determine the dropping position and order
- We need to start by placing the first block, 'b13', vertically at slot 0 in the center column (slot 10). This will serve as the base for the other blocks.
ab_drop('b13', 10)

- Next, we can place the two side blocks, 'b31', on top of the base block. They should be placed on slots 2 and 18 to prevent overhangs.
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 18)

- Finally, we can place the middle block, 'b31', on top of the base block. It should be placed on slot 10 to maintain stability and symmetry.
ab_drop('b31', 10)

Step 3: Check if all hard constraints are met
- Stability: The 'b31' blocks are placed on the base block, ensuring stability and preventing overhangs.
- Structure separation: The blocks are placed close to each other, ensuring the structure is not separated.

The final structure will resemble the character "M".
