To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. First, let's consider the stability constraints. We know that a b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. So, we will start by placing two b31 blocks on the base.

2. Next, we need to place two b13 blocks on top of the b31 blocks to complete the middle part of the "M". We will drop these blocks on the same slot position as the b31 blocks.

3. Now, we need to complete the left and right sides of the "M". We will place two b31 blocks on top of the b13 blocks, one on the left side and one on the right side.

4. Finally, we will place two b13 blocks on top of the b31 blocks on the left and right sides to complete the structure of the "M".

Based on this plan, the code to generate the desired structure will be as follows:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 17)
ab_drop('b13', 17)
ab_drop('b13', 17)
```

This code will drop the blocks in the specified order and positions to form a stable structure resembling the character "M".
