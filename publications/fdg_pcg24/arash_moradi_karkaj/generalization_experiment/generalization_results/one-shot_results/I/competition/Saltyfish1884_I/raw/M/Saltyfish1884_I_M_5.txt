In order to generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully plan and execute the drops of different block types. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the given code:

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. To meet the stability constraint, we need to start by dropping a b11 block at the center slot. This will serve as the base for the entire structure:

ab_drop('b11', W/2)

3. Next, we need to drop two b31 blocks on top of the base block to form the two outer vertical lines of the "M" shape:

ab_drop('b31', W/2 + 1)
ab_drop('b31', W/2 - 1)

4. Now, we can drop a b13 block on top of the base block to connect the two outer vertical lines:

ab_drop('b13', W/2)

5. Finally, we need to drop two b11 blocks on top of the b31 blocks to form the two middle horizontal lines of the "M" shape:

ab_drop('b11', W/2 + 2)
ab_drop('b11', W/2 - 2)

After executing these steps, the structure will resemble the character "M" and will meet all the hard constraints of stability. Note that the exact slot numbers may vary depending on the width of the map.
