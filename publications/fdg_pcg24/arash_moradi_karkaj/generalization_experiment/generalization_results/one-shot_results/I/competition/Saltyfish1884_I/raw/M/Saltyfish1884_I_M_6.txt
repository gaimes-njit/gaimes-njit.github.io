To generate a structure that resembles the character "M", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the first block (b31) at the center slot of the bottom layer to form the base:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Place the second block (b13) on top of the base, aligned with the slot of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Place the third block (b11) on top of the previous block, shifted one slot to the left:
```
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

5. Place the fourth block (b11) on top of the previous block, shifted one slot to the right:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

6. Place the fifth block (b13) on top of the previous two blocks, aligned with the slot of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "M" and satisfy all hard constraints.
