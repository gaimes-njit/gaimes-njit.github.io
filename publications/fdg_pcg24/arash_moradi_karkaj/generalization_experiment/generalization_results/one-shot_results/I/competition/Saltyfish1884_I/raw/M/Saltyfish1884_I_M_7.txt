To generate a structure resembling the character "M" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully consider the constraints and plan our steps accordingly. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Start by initializing the structure grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. We need to ensure stability and meet the first stability rule, which states that a b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. To achieve this, we can drop a b13 block first, followed by two b31 blocks. The block center alignment (y) will remain the same for all blocks. Use the ab_drop() function to place the blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will create the initial structure resembling the left side of the "M" character.

3. Next, we need to meet the second stability rule, which states that blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing. We can achieve this by dropping two more b13 blocks at the bottom of the structure (slots 2 and 3) to provide a stable base:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

4. Lastly, we need to ensure that the structure is not separated and meets the third stability rule. To do this, we can drop two b31 blocks on top of the existing structure (at slots 2 and 3) to create the right side of the "M" character:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "M" and meet all the given hard constraints. You can visualize the structure by printing the 'structure' variable after executing all the ab_drop() functions.
