To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M" while meeting all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Determine the dropping position and order of the blocks.

Given the constraints, we can start by placing the two vertical blocks (b13) in the middle and slightly offset from each other to create the two outer strokes of the "M". The dropping positions for the vertical blocks can be around slot 8 and slot 11.

Next, we can drop the horizontal block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks, aligning its center with the midpoint of the two vertical blocks. This will form the central stroke of the "M". The dropping position for the horizontal block can be around slot 9.

Step 3: Use the ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks to form the structure that resembles the given character.

Based on the determined dropping positions and order, we can use the ab_drop() function to place the blocks accordingly. The structure formation code could be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Drop the left vertical block (b13)
ab_drop('b13', 12)  # Drop the right vertical block (b13)
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop the horizontal block (b31)
```

This code will drop the blocks in the desired positions, forming a stable structure that resembles the character "M".

Note: The specific dropping positions and order mentioned here are just one possible solution. Depending on the requirements, other dropping positions and orders can be determined to achieve different structures that meet all the constraints.
