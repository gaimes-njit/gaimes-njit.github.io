To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M", we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

Step 2: Drop a b31 block at slot 6.
ab_drop('b31', 6)

Step 3: Drop a b13 block at slot 6.
ab_drop('b13', 6)

Step 4: Drop a b31 block at slot 6.
ab_drop('b31', 6)

Now, the structure should resemble the character "M" with stable placements of the blocks.
