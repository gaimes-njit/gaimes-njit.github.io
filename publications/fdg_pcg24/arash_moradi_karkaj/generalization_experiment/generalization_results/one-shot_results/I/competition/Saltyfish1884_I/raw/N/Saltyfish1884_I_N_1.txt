To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N," we need to carefully consider the constraints and plan the placement of blocks step by step.

Step 1: Place the base
Since the bottom of the structure should be stable, we need to place a b11 block as the base. We can start by dropping a b11 block in the leftmost slot on layer 0.

Step 2: Place the vertical part of the structure
To form the vertical part of the "N," we need to place a b13 block on top of the base. This will provide stability and prevent overhangs.

ab_drop('b13', 0)

Step 3: Place the horizontal part of the structure
Next, we need to place a b31 block horizontally on top of the vertical block. This will complete the "N" shape.

ab_drop('b31', 0)

Step 4: Adjust the position of the horizontal part
To ensure stability and reduce the risk of collapsing, we can move the horizontal part of the structure further down. We can do this by dropping another b31 block on top of the existing one.

ab_drop('b31', 0)

Step 5: Connect the vertical part to the horizontal part
To prevent the structure from being separated, we can place another b13 block on top of the previously dropped b31 block. This will connect the vertical and horizontal parts of the "N."

ab_drop('b13', 0)

Step 6: Adjust the position of the vertical part
To further stabilize the structure and lower its center of gravity, we can drop another b13 block on top of the existing one. This will make the vertical part of the "N" shorter.

ab_drop('b13', 0)

Step 7: Finishing touches
If desired, we can add additional blocks to fill empty spaces or enhance stability. However, keep in mind that the goal is to create a structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all the hard constraints.
