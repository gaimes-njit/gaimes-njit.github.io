To generate a stable structure resembling the character "N" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to think about the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the first block 'b31' at slot 1 to form the left vertical stroke of the "N".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 3: Drop the second block 'b13' at slot 1 to form the middle horizontal stroke of the "N".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Step 4: Drop the third block 'b31' at slot 1 to form the right vertical stroke of the "N".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "N" with three blocks stacked vertically.
