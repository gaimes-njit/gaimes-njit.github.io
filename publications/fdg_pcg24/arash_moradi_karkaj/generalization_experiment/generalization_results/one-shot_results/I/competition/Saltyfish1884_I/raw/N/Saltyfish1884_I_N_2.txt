To generate a stable structure resembling the character "N" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks.

Based on the stability constraint, we can start by placing a b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Let's start by placing a b31 block on slot 1.

ab_drop('b31', 1)

Next, we can place a b13 block on the same slot to form the vertical line of the "N" character.

ab_drop('b13', 1)

Finally, we can place another b31 block on slot 1 to complete the horizontal line of the "N" character.

ab_drop('b31', 1)

This sequence of block placements will ensure stability and prevent the structure from collapsing. The resulting structure will resemble the character "N" and meet all hard constraints.

Please note that the specific placement of the blocks may vary depending on the starting empty structure and the order of other block placements in the game. However, the general approach of placing a b31 block on the base, followed by a b13 block on the same slot, and then another b31 block on the same slot will still apply.
