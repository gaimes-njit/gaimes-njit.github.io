To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all hard constraints, we will follow the step-by-step approach mentioned. 

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the code provided.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Consider the constraints in part 5 carefully.
- Stability: A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs, blocks should be placed as low as possible, and the structure should not be separated.
- No boundary intrusion: Blocks should not intrude on the map's boundary.

Step 3: Determine the shape of the structure.
Considering the "N" character, we can visualize it as three blocks stacked vertically. The bottom block will be a b31 block, the middle block will be a b13 block, and the top block will be another b31 block.

Step 4: Use the ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks and form the structure.

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This will drop a b31 block, followed by a b13 block, and finally another b31 block. The blocks will be dropped in slot 1, aligning their centers accordingly.
