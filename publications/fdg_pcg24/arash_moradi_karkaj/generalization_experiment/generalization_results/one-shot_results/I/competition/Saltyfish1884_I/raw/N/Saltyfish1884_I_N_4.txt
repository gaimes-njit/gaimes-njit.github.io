To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N", we need to carefully consider the constraints and plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks.

Let's break down the problem step by step and follow the given constraints:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid as an empty WxH grid.
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Determine the dropping positions and order of the blocks.
- First, we need to place a b13 block vertically on the left side of the structure to form the left leg of the "N". We can do this by using the ab_drop() function as follows:
ab_drop('b13', 0)

- Next, we need to place a b31 block horizontally on top of the b13 block to form the top bar of the "N". We can use the ab_drop() function again:
ab_drop('b31', 1)

- Finally, we need to place another b13 block vertically on the right side of the structure to form the right leg of the "N". We can use the ab_drop() function once more:
ab_drop('b13', 2)

Step 3: The final structure will resemble the character "N" with the blocks properly placed to meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

The Python code to generate the stable structure that resembles the character "N" would be:

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]  # Initialize the structure grid
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Place b13 block vertically on the left side
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place b31 block horizontally on top
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place b13 block vertically on the right side

Please note that this is just one way to generate the structure and there might be other valid solutions as well.
