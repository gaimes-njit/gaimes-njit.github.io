To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N," we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
    
    structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
    
2. Start by dropping a b31 block at slot 1:

    ab_drop('b31', 1)
    
3. Drop a b11 block at slot 1, vertically on top of the previously dropped block:

    ab_drop('b11', 1)
    
4. Drop another b31 block at slot 1, vertically on top of the previously dropped block:

    ab_drop('b31', 1)
    
5. Drop a b13 block at slot 0, vertically on top of the previously dropped block:

    ab_drop('b13', 0)
    
6. Drop a b11 block at slot 2, vertically on top of the previously dropped block:

    ab_drop('b11', 2)
    
7. Finally, drop a b31 block at slot 2, vertically on top of the previously dropped block:

    ab_drop('b31', 2)
    
The final structure will resemble the character "N".
