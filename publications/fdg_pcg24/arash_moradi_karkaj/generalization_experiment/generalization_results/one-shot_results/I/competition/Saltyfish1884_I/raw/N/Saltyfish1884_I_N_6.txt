To generate a structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully determine the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Place the base block (b11) at the bottom layer (layer 0). This will serve as the foundation for the structure:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

3. Place a vertical block (b13) on top of the base block at the same slot:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Place a horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block at the same slot:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

5. Place a vertical block (b13) on top of the horizontal block at the same slot:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

6. Place a horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block, but shift it one slot to the right:
```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

7. Place a vertical block (b13) on top of the horizontal block at the same slot:
```
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

By following these steps, the structure will resemble the character "N" and meet all the hard constraints.
