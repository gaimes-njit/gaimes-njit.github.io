To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully consider the constraints and plan the dropping position and order of the blocks.

1. Stability Constraint: 
We need to ensure that the structure is stable and does not collapse. The b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Blocks should also be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing. Additionally, the structure should not be separated.

2. No Boundary Intrusion Constraint: 
We should try to avoid intruding on the map's boundaries to minimize the area of intrusion regions.

Based on these constraints, let's plan the structure step by step and use the ab_drop() function to place suitable blocks:

1. Place a b31 block at slot 1 to form the left side of the "N" shape. This block will serve as the base for the rest of the structure.
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

2. Place a b13 block at slot 1 on top of the b31 block to form the left vertical part of the "N" shape.
   ab_drop('b13', 1)

3. Place a b31 block at slot 1 on top of the b13 block to form the middle horizontal part of the "N" shape.
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

4. Place a b13 block at slot 5 on top of the b31 block to form the right vertical part of the "N" shape.
   ab_drop('b13', 5)

5. Place a b31 block at slot 5 on top of the b13 block to form the right side of the "N" shape.
   ab_drop('b31', 5)

The final structure will resemble the character "N" and meet all the given constraints.

Note: The specific slot positions for placing the blocks may vary depending on the requirements and desired appearance of the structure.
