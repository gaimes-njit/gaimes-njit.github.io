To generate a stable structure resembling the character "N" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by placing a b31 block at slot 1, near the left edge. This will serve as the left vertical part of the "N".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block, at slot 1. This will create the horizontal middle part of the "N".

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Place another b31 block on top of the b13 block, at slot 1. This will complete the left vertical part of the "N".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "N" and meet all the given constraints. You can modify the code above to fit your specific needs.
