To generate a structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability rules and constraints.

1. Stability: 
- We need to start by placing a b31 block on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. This block will form the diagonal line on the left side of the "N".
- Next, we will place a b13 block on the solid base below the right end of the b31 block to create the vertical line on the right side of the "N".
- Finally, we will place another b31 block on the b13 block, overlapping with the b31 block on the left side. This will complete the horizontal line of the "N".

2. No boundary intrusion:
- Since the width of the map is partitioned into 20 slots, we need to ensure that the blocks do not intrude on the boundary by keeping the slot numbers within the range of 0 to 19.

Using these considerations, we can use the ab_drop() function to generate the structure that resembles the character "N". Here is an example code:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty 20x16 grid
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Place the b31 block on a solid base
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Place the b13 block below the right end of the b31 block
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Place the second b31 block overlapping with the first b31 block
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This should generate a structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all hard constraints.
