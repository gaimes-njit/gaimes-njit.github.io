To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "O" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully consider the constraints and plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks.

First, let's consider the stability constraint (5.1). To prevent overhangs, we need to place a b31 block on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks). Since the character "O" has a circular shape, we can use a combination of b11 and b13 blocks to form the base. We can start by placing a b11 block in the center of the bottom layer (layer 0) to act as the center of the "O". This will help in maintaining stability.

Next, we can place two b13 blocks on either side of the center block in the bottom layer to create a stable base for the "O". The b13 blocks will act as supports for the b31 blocks that will form the outer circle of the "O".

After creating the base, we can then drop the b31 blocks to form the outer circle. We can start by dropping a b31 block on top of each b13 block in the bottom layer. This will create the left and right sides of the outer circle.

Finally, we can drop two b31 blocks on top of the b31 blocks in the previous layer. These blocks will complete the outer circle of the "O".

In summary, the steps to generate the structure resembling the character "O" would be as follows:

```
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks to form the base
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Place a b11 block in the center of the bottom layer (slot 10)
ab_drop('b13', 9)   # Place a b13 block on the left side of the center block (slot 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Place a b13 block on the right side of the center block (slot 11)

# Drop the blocks to form the outer circle
ab_drop('b31', 9)   # Place a b31 block on top of the left b13 block (slot 9)
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Place a b31 block on top of the right b13 block (slot 11)

# Drop the blocks to complete the outer circle
ab_drop('b31', 9)   # Place a b31 block on top of the left b31 block (slot 9)
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Place a b31 block on top of the right b31 block (slot 11)
```
