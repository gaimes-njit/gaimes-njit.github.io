To generate a structure that resembles the character "O" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Based on the stability constraint, we know that a b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Additionally, blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing and the structure should not be separated.

To meet the stability constraint, we can start by placing a b11 block at the center slot (slot 9) on the bottom layer (layer 0). This provides a solid base for the rest of the structure.

Next, we can place a b13 block centered on top of the b11 block in slot 9. This creates a stable platform for the b31 blocks to rest on.

Now, we can place two b31 blocks on each side of the b13 block in slots 6 and 12. This completes the structure that resembles the character "O".

Using the ab_drop() function, the code to generate this structure would be:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

After running this code, the `structure` grid will contain the desired structure that resembles the character "O".
