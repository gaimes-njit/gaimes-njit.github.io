To generate a structure resembling the character "O" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Start by initializing the structure grid:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b31 block on the left side of the structure to form the left vertical side of the "O":

```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Place a b11 block on top of the previous block to form the top horizontal side of the "O":

```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

4. Place another b31 block on the right side of the structure to complete the right vertical side of the "O":

```python
ab_drop('b31', W-1)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "O" while meeting all the hard constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.

Please note that the above code is provided as an example and may not generate the exact desired structure. The specific placement of blocks might need to be adjusted based on the initial state of the structure and the target character shape.
