To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "O", we need to carefully place the blocks while considering the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

First, let's analyze the stability constraint:
- A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
- Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
- The structure should not be separated.

Based on these rules, the shape of the structure should be a rectangle with the same width and height, using b11 blocks on the base and b13/b31 blocks on the sides.

Now let's use the ab_drop() function to generate the structure step by step:

# Step 1: Place the b31 block on the left side
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Step 2: Place the b11 blocks on the base
for i in range(1, 19):  # Exclude the left and right boundaries
    ab_drop('b11', i)

# Step 3: Place the b31 block on the right side
ab_drop('b31', 18)

# Step 4: Place the b11 blocks on the top layer
for i in range(1, 19):  # Exclude the left and right boundaries
    ab_drop('b11', i)

# Step 5: Place the b13 block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Step 6: Place the b11 blocks on the top layer
for i in range(1, 19):  # Exclude the left and right boundaries
    ab_drop('b11', i)

# Step 7: Place the b13 block on the right side
ab_drop('b13', 18)

# Step 8: Place the b11 blocks on the top layer
for i in range(1, 19):  # Exclude the left and right boundaries
    ab_drop('b11', i)
    
# Final structure forms the shape of "O" character

The above steps will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "O" while meeting all the hard constraints of stability and soft constraints of boundary intrusion.
