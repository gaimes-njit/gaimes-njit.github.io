To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "O" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the base block:
   - Use `ab_drop('b11', 9)` to drop a b11 block in the center slot (slot 9) of the bottom layer (layer 0).

2. Place the first vertical blocks on top of the base block:
   - Use `ab_drop('b13', 8)` to drop a b13 block in slot 8 of layer 1.
   - Use `ab_drop('b13', 10)` to drop another b13 block in slot 10 of layer 1.

3. Place the first horizontal blocks on top of the vertical blocks:
   - Use `ab_drop('b31', 7)` to drop a b31 block in slot 7 of layer 2.
   - Use `ab_drop('b31', 11)` to drop another b31 block in slot 11 of layer 2.

4. Place the second set of vertical blocks on top of the horizontal blocks:
   - Use `ab_drop('b13', 6)` to drop a b13 block in slot 6 of layer 3.
   - Use `ab_drop('b13', 12)` to drop another b13 block in slot 12 of layer 3.

5. Place the second set of horizontal blocks on top of the vertical blocks:
   - Use `ab_drop('b31', 5)` to drop a b31 block in slot 5 of layer 4.
   - Use `ab_drop('b31', 7)` to drop another b31 block in slot 7 of layer 4.
   - Use `ab_drop('b31', 9)` to drop another b31 block in slot 9 of layer 4.
   - Use `ab_drop('b31', 11)` to drop another b31 block in slot 11 of layer 4.
   - Use `ab_drop('b31', 13)` to drop another b31 block in slot 13 of layer 4.

6. Place the final set of vertical blocks on top of the horizontal blocks:
   - Use `ab_drop('b13', 4)` to drop a b13 block in slot 4 of layer 5.
   - Use `ab_drop('b13', 6)` to drop another b13 block in slot 6 of layer 5.
   - Use `ab_drop('b13', 8)` to drop another b13 block in slot 8 of layer 5.
   - Use `ab_drop('b13', 10)` to drop another b13 block in slot 10 of layer 5.
   - Use `ab_drop('b13', 12)` to drop another b13 block in slot 12 of layer 5.
   - Use `ab_drop('b13', 14)` to drop another b13 block in slot 14 of layer 5.

After executing these steps, the `structure` variable will contain a stable structure that resembles the character "O" with the blocks placed in a way that satisfies all the given constraints.
