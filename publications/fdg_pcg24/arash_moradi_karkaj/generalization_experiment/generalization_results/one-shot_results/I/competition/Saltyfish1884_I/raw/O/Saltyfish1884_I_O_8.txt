To create a structure that resembles the character "O", we need to consider the constraints mentioned and plan the placement of the blocks accordingly. 

First, we need to ensure stability by placing a solid base. In this case, we can use a b11 block as the base. We should place it on the bottom layer (layer 0) and at a suitable slot for weight distribution.

Next, we need to place blocks to form the shape of the character "O". Since the shape is circular, we can use a combination of b31 and b13 blocks. We should avoid separating the structure, so the blocks should be placed close together.

Based on these considerations, we can use the ab_drop() function to place the blocks as follows:

1. Place the base block:
ab_drop('b11', 9) 

2. Place the b13 blocks to form the sides of the "O":
ab_drop('b13', 8) 
ab_drop('b13', 10) 

3. Place the b31 blocks to form the top and bottom of the "O":
ab_drop('b31', 8) 
ab_drop('b31', 10) 

The final result will be a stable structure resembling the character "O" formed by the placement of the blocks according to the constraints. The placement order and positions can be adjusted based on personal preference as long as the hard constraints are met and stability is ensured.
