To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "O", we need to carefully consider the stability rules mentioned in the constraints. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve the goal:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks at the bottom layer to form a solid base:

```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

3. Place the first vertical block at the center of the base:

```
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

4. Place the horizontal blocks on top of the vertical block to complete the structure:

```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
```

This arrangement creates a stable structure that resembles the character "O". The order and position of the blocks are determined using the ab_drop() function to ensure stability and meeting all constraints.
