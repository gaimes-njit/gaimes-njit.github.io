To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "P" using the ab_drop() function, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Analyze the constraints carefully. The first constraint states that a b31 block must be placed on a solid base to prevent overhangs. Therefore, we should start by placing a b31 block on the base (layer 0).

3. Use the ab_drop() function to drop a b31 block at a suitable slot on the base:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will drop the b31 block centered at slot 9 on the base.

4. The second constraint states that blocks should not intrude on the map's boundary. Since the b31 block takes 3 units of width, we should drop the next block (b13) at a slot where it does not intrude on the boundary. In this case, we will choose slot 7.

5. Use the ab_drop() function to drop a b13 block at slot 7:
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```
This will drop the b13 block centered at slot 7 above the b31 block.

6. Finally, to complete the structure resembling the character "P", drop another b31 block on top of the b13 block at slot 9:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

The result would be a stable structure that resembles the character "P" and meets all the hard constraints.
