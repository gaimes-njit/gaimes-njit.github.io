To generate a structure that resembles the character "P" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Place the first block (b31) at the appropriate slot to form the vertical line of the "P" shape. Since the block must be placed on a solid base, we should drop it on the base itself. Choose a suitable slot for the center of the block (e.g., 10) and use the ab_drop() function to place it:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

3. Place the second block (b13) on top of the previous block to form the curved part of the "P" shape. Again, choose a suitable slot for the block's center (e.g., 10) and use the ab_drop() function to place it:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 10)
   ```

4. Place the third block (b31) on top of the previous block to complete the horizontal line of the "P" shape. Choose a suitable slot for the block's center (e.g., 10) and use the ab_drop() function to place it:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

5. The final structure will resemble the character "P" while meeting the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

The final Python code to generate the structure can be:
```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# place the first block (b31) at slot 10
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# place the second block (b13) on top of the previous block at slot 10
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# place the third block (b31) on top of the previous block at slot 10
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

Note: The example provided in the question is just an example, and the slot numbers and block placements may vary depending on the specific requirements or desired "P" shape. Adjust the slot numbers and block types accordingly to achieve the desired result.
