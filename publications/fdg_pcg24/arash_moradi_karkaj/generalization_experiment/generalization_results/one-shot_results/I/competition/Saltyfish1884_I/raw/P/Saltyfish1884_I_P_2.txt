To create a structure that resembles the character "P" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully consider the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Determine the dropping position and order for each block type to ensure stability.

Dropping position for 'b31' blocks:
- To prevent overhang, we need to place 'b31' blocks on a solid base.
- Place the first 'b31' block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and align its center with slot 1.
- Place the second 'b31' block on top of the first one and align its center with slot 1.
- Place the third 'b31' block on top of the second one and align its center with slot 1.
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Dropping position for 'b13' blocks:
- Place the 'b13' block on top of the 'b31' structure and align its center with slot 1. This maintains stability.
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Step 3: The structure resembling the character "P" is created.

Final code:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "P" while meeting all the given constraints.
