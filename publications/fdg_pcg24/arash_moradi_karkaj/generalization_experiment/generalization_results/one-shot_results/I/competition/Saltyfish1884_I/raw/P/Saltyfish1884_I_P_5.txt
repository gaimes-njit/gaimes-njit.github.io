To create a stable structure that resembles the character "P" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the dropping positions and order for the blocks by considering the stability rules and constraints.
2. Define the shape of the structure and plan the positions for each block accordingly.
3. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the blocks in the determined order and positions to build the structure.

Based on the constraints, stability rules, and the desired shape of the structure, we can come up with the following step-by-step plan:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Drop the first block ('b31') at slot 1 to form the vertical line of the "P":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Drop the second block ('b13') at slot 1, just above the previous block, to complete the vertical line of the "P":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Drop the third block ('b31') at slot 1, just above the previous blocks, to form the top horizontal line of the "P":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "P". Make sure to adjust the dropping positions and order if needed to meet all the constraints and stability rules.

Remember, you can customize the dropping positions and order based on your desired shape of the structure while still meeting all the given requirements.
