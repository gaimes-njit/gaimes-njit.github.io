To generate a stable structure resembling the character "P", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given code.

2. Place a b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) at the leftmost slot to create the vertical line of the "P" shape. Use the `ab_drop('b31', 0)` function.

3. Place a b13 block on top of the previous block at the same slot to create the horizontal line of the "P" shape. Use the `ab_drop('b13', 0)` function.

4. Place another b31 block on top of the previous block at the same slot to complete the vertical line of the "P" shape. Use the `ab_drop('b31', 0)` function.

5. Your final code should be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

After executing this code, the structure will resemble the character "P" while meeting all the hard constraints, including stability and no boundary intrusion.
