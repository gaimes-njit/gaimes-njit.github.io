To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "P" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the b11 block on the bottom layer as the base.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

This will drop the b11 block at slot 9, which will act as the base of the structure.

Step 3: Place the b31 block on top of the base.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

This will drop the b31 block at slot 9, aligning it with the base.

Step 4: Place the b13 block on the right side of the b31 block.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

This will drop the b13 block at slot 11, aligning it with the right side of the b31 block.

Step 5: Place the b31 block on top of the b13 block.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

This will drop the b31 block at slot 11, aligning it with the b13 block.

The final structure will resemble the character "P" and will satisfy all the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. 

Note: The exact slot numbers may need to be adjusted based on the desired position and size of the resulting structure.
