To generate a structure that resembles the character "P" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to plan our block placement step by step. Considering the stability and boundary intrusion constraints, we can come up with the following plan:

1. Begin by dropping a b31 block at slot 1 to form the vertical line of the "P" character.

    ab_drop('b31', 1)

2. Drop a b13 block at slot 1 to form the horizontal line of the "P" character, connecting with the vertical line.

    ab_drop('b13', 1)

3. Finally, drop another b31 block at slot 1 to complete the top loop of the "P" character.

    ab_drop('b31', 1)
    
The final structure will resemble the character "P" and meet all the hard constraints.
