To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q" while meeting all the hard constraints, the following steps can be followed:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code: structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Start by placing a b31 block at the center slot (slot 10) using the ab_drop() function: ab_drop('b31', 10)

3. Place a b13 block just below the previously placed b31 block to form the vertical part of the "Q": ab_drop('b13', 10)

4. Place another b31 block to the right of the vertical part, creating the circular part of the "Q": ab_drop('b31', 14)

5. To ensure stability, make sure that the structure is not separated. Check if the structure is stable by examining the lowest row of each column. If any column does not contain a solid base (b11 or b13 block), adjust the placement of the blocks accordingly.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the structure resembles the character "Q" and meets all the stability constraints.

The final code may look like the following:

ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
