To generate a structure that resembles the character "Q" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. 

Step by step, we can follow these guidelines:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b31 block on a solid base to prevent overhangs. This block will form the bottom half of the "Q" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Place a b13 block on top of the previous block to complete the lower loop of the "Q" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Place another b31 block on top of the previous block to form the upper loop of the "Q" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "Q" with proper weight distribution and stability.
