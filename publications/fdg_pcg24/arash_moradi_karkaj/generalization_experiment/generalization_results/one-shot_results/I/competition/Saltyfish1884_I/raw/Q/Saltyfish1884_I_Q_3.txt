To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q", we need to carefully consider the stability rules and constraints mentioned.

First, let's think about the stability rules:
1) A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
2) Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
3) Structure should not be separated.

Next, let's consider the shape of the structure that resembles the character "Q":
The character "Q" can be represented as a combination of a b31 block and two b13 blocks placed below it.

Now, let's use the ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks to form the structure that resembles the "Q" character based on the above considerations:

# Drop the b31 block in the middle of the structure
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the first b13 block below the b31 block
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Drop the second b13 block below the b31 block but in the slot next to the first b13 block
ab_drop('b13', 10)

This will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q" while meeting all the hard constraints.

Note: The exact positions and order of the blocks may vary depending on the implementation of the ab_drop() function and the specific requirements of the problem. The code provided above is just an example.
