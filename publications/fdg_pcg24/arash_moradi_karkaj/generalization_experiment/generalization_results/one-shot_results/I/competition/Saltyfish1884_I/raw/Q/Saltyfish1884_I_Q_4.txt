To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q", we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Initialize the structure
Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid with the given width and height:

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Dropping the first block (b31)
To meet the stability constraint, we need to start with a solid base. Drop a b31 block at slot 1:

ab_drop('b31', 1)

Step 3: Dropping the second block (b13)
To form the loop shape of the character "Q", we can place a b13 block on top of the b31 block:

ab_drop('b13', 1)

Step 4: Dropping the third block (b31)
To complete the loop shape, we need to add another b31 block on top of the existing structure. It should be aligned with the center of the previous b13 block:

ab_drop('b31', 1)

The final structure will resemble the character "Q" and meet all the stability and boundary constraints.

Here is the final Python code:

ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
