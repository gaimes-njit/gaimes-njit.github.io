To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Place a b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. To achieve this, drop a b31 block at slot 6, which is aligned with its center:

ab_drop('b31', 6)

This will place a b31 block at the bottom layer of the structure, covering slots 5, 6, and 7.

3. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block to create the circular shape of the "Q". Drop a b11 block at slot 6, aligned with its center:

ab_drop('b11', 6)

This will place a b11 block above the b31 block, covering only slot 6.

4. Place another b31 block on top of the b11 block to complete the circular shape. Drop a b31 block at slot 6, aligned with its center:

ab_drop('b31', 6)

This will place a b31 block above the b11 block, covering slots 5, 6, and 7.

5. To meet the stability constraint, the structure should not be separated. To achieve this, we need to fill the empty slots surrounding the circular shape with b13 blocks. Drop a b13 block at slots 5 and 7, aligned with their centers:

ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 7)

This will place b13 blocks at slots 5 and 7, ensuring the circular shape is not separated from the rest of the structure.

The final structure will resemble the character "Q" and meet all hard constraints:
