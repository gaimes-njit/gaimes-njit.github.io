To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks using the ab_drop() function. Here is a step-by-step approach to forming the structure:

Step 1: Place the base block (b11) at the bottom layer (layer 0) and in the middle slot (slot 10) to provide a stable foundation for the structure.
    ab_drop('b11', 10)

Step 2: Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the base block, aligned with the middle slot (slot 10). This will form the vertical part of the "Q".
    ab_drop('b13', 10)

Step 3: Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block, aligned with the middle slot (slot 10). This will form the top part of the "Q".
    ab_drop('b31', 10)

Step 4: Place another horizontal block (b31) on top of the first horizontal block, aligned with the leftmost slot (slot 0). This will extend the top part of the "Q" towards the left side.
    ab_drop('b31', 0)

Step 5: Place another horizontal block (b31) on top of the first horizontal block, aligned with the rightmost slot (slot 19). This will extend the top part of the "Q" towards the right side.
    ab_drop('b31', 19)

Step 6: To ensure stability, place a vertical block (b13) on top of the remaining gaps between the horizontal blocks at the top part of the "Q". This will fill the gaps and prevent any potential overhangs.
    ab_drop('b13', 2)
    ab_drop('b13', 4)
    ab_drop('b13', 5)
    ab_drop('b13', 17)
    ab_drop('b13', 15)
    ab_drop('b13', 13)

Step 7: To ensure stability and prevent the structure from being separated, fill any remaining gaps at the base of the structure with base blocks (b11).
    for i in range(W):
        if structure[H-1][i] == ' ':
            ab_drop('b11', i)

The final code to generate the stable structure resembling the character "Q" would be:

ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 19)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 17)
ab_drop('b13', 15)
ab_drop('b13', 13)
for i in range(W):
    if structure[H-1][i] == ' ':
        ab_drop('b11', i)
