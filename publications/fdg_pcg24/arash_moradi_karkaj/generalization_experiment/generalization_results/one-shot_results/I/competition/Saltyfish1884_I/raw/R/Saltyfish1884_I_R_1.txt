To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R", we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks to meet all the hard constraints. 

First, let's analyze the constraints and determine the shape of the structure.

5.1 Stability Constraints:
- A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
- Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
- Structure should not be separated.

5.2 No boundary intrusion Constraint:
- Blocks should not intrude on the map's boundary, both in width (W) and height (H).

Considering the constraints, we can determine the shape of the structure resembling the character "R". We can divide the structure into three sections:

1. The vertical part of the "R":
- We can use a b13 block placed as low as possible as the base of the vertical part.
- On top of the base, we can place two b31 blocks to form the vertical part of the "R".

2. The diagonal part of the "R":
- We can use a b31 block as the base, placed adjacent to the vertical part.
- On top of the base, we can place a b11 block to form the diagonal part of the "R".

3. The horizontal part of the "R":
- We can use a b31 block as the base, placed next to the diagonal part.
- On top of the base, we can place a b31 block to form the horizontal part of the "R".

Now, we can use the ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks to form the structure that resembles the given character "R".

The Python code for placing the blocks could be as follows:

---
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
---

This code will drop the blocks in the required order and positions to form a stable structure resembling the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints.

You can modify the positions and order of the blocks according to your own interpretation of the character "R" and the specific placement constraints.
