The goal is to generate a structure that resembles the character "R" using the ab_drop() function while satisfying the hard constraints of stability and the soft constraint of no boundary intrusion. 

Based on the given constraints, we can determine the shape of the structure that resembles the character "R". It consists of a vertical block (b13) on the left side, followed by a horizontal block (b31) above it, and another vertical block (b13) on the right side. 

To achieve this structure, we can use the ab_drop() function as follows:

1. Drop a vertical block (b13) on the left side in slot 1.
ab_drop('b13', 1)

2. Drop a horizontal block (b31) above the vertical block in slot 1.
ab_drop('b31', 1)

3. Drop another vertical block (b13) on the right side in slot 1.
ab_drop('b13', 1)

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting all the given constraints.
