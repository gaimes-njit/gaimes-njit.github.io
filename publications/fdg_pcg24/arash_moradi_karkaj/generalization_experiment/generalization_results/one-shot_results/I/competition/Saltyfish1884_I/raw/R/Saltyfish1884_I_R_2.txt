To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting the hard constraints, we can use the ab_drop() function to strategically place the blocks in the desired order and position. Here's an example solution:

# Step 1: Place the base block
ab_drop('b11', 9) # Place a b11 block at slot 9 (centered)

# Step 2: Place the vertical block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 6) # Place a b13 block at slot 6 (left side)

# Step 3: Place the horizontal block on top
ab_drop('b31', 9) # Place a b31 block at slot 9 (centered)

# Step 4: Place the vertical block on the right side
ab_drop('b13', 12) # Place a b13 block at slot 12 (right side)

# Step 5: Place a horizontal block on top of the right side vertical block to complete the "R" shape
ab_drop('b31', 12) # Place a b31 block at slot 12 (centered)

This solution ensures stability by following the stability rules: the b31 blocks are placed on top of solid base blocks (b11 or b13 blocks), the blocks are placed as low as possible by starting from the base layer, and the structure remains connected without any separation. Additionally, this solution does not intrude on the boundary of the map, satisfying the no boundary intrusion constraint.

Please note that this is just one possible solution. The exact placement of blocks may vary depending on the specific requirements and desired outcome.
