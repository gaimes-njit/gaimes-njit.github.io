To generate a structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is the step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop a b31 block at slot 1 to form the right vertical line of the "R" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 1 to connect the bottom of the vertical line and form the right leg of the "R" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Drop another b31 block at slot 1 to extend the horizontal line to the right:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. Adjust the position of the top-right block to make sure the structure is stable. Optionally, you can also adjust the positions of other blocks to improve stability further.

NOTE: The exact dropping positions and order might vary based on the initial position and size of the blocks. The example provided above is just one possible configuration to form the "R" shape.

By following this step-by-step process and using the ab_drop() function, you can generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting all the given constraints.
