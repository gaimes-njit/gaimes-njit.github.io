To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base of the "R" structure using the b11 block:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

Step 3: Place the vertical part of the "R" structure using the b13 block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal part of the "R" structure using the b31 block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "R" and meet all the given constraints. You can adjust the drop positions and order of the blocks to generate different structures that still resemble the "R" character.
