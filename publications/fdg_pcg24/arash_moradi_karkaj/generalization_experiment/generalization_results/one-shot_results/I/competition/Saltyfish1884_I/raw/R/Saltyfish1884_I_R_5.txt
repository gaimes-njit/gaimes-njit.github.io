To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R", while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order using the ab_drop() function. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Determine the dropping positions and order based on the constraints:
Based on the stability constraint (5.1), we need to ensure that blocks are placed on a solid base and as low as possible. For the character "R", we can start by dropping the b31 block on the base. Let's assume slot 1 as the initial drop position.

3. Drop the first block (b31) to form the right vertical stroke of the "R":
ab_drop('b31', 1)

4. Drop the second block (b13) on the same slot to connect with the bottom of the first block:
ab_drop('b13', 1)

5. Drop the third block (b31) to complete the shape of the "R":
ab_drop('b31', 1)

6. The final structure will resemble the character "R" with the given dropping positions and order. You can visualize it by printing the structure:
print('\n'.join([' '.join(row) for row in structure]))

Note: The slot numbers (0-19) can be adjusted based on the desired position of the character "R". The example given here is just one possibility.
