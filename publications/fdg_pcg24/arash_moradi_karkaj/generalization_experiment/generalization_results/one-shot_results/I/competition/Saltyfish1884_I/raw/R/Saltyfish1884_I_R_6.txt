To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Analyze the constraints: The stability constraint requires us to place the blocks in a way that prevents overhangs and ensures the structure does not collapse. The no boundary intrusion constraint requires us to avoid intruding on the map's boundaries.

2. Plan the structure: Based on the shape of the character "R," we can determine that it consists of two b31 blocks stacked vertically on top of each other, with a b13 block attached to the right side of the bottom b31 block.

3. Initialize the structure: We start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

4. Generate the structure using the ab_drop() function:

   a. Place the bottom b31 block:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   ```

   b. Place the top b31 block:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   ```

   c. Place the b13 block:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

   Note: The slot numbers used in the ab_drop() function are determined based on the desired alignment of the block centers.

5. The final implementation will be as follows:

   ```python
   # initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

   # Function to drop blocks based on the desired structure
   def generate_structure():
       ab_drop('b31', 0)    # Place the bottom b31 block
       ab_drop('b31', 0)    # Place the top b31 block
       ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place the b13 block

   # Call generate_structure() to generate the desired structure
   generate_structure()
   ```

   This implementation will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints.
