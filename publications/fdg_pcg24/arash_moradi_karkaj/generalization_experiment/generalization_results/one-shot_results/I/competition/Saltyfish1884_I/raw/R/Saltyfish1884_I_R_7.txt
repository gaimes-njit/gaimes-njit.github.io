To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R", we need to carefully consider the placement and order of the blocks to meet all the given constraints.

First, let's analyze the stability constraints:

1) A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs:
   To meet this constraint, we need to start by placing a b11 or b13 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and a suitable slot. Let's choose slot 1.

2) Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing:
   To meet this constraint, we should drop the blocks as low as possible while still maintaining stability. This means dropping them on top of previously dropped blocks whenever possible.

3) Structure should not be separated:
   To meet this constraint, we need to ensure that all the blocks are connected and there are no gaps or separations in the structure.

Now, let's determine the shape of the structure that resembles the character "R":

Based on the shape of the character "R", we can break it down into the following blocks:
- A vertical b13 block placed at slot 1 and starting from layer 0.
- A horizontal b31 block placed on top of the vertical b13 block and centered at slot 1.
- Another vertical b13 block placed on top of the horizontal b31 block and also centered at slot 1.

Now, we can use the ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks to form the structure that resembles the character "R". Here is the Python code:

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Place the blocks to form the structure
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical b13 block at slot 1 and layer 0
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal b31 block on top, centered at slot 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the second vertical b13 block on top, centered at slot 1

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting all the given constraints.
