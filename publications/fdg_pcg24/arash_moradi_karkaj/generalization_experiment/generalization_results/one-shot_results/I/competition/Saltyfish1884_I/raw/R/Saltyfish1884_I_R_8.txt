To generate a structure that resembles the character "R", we need to consider the constraints and follow a step-by-step approach. 

1. Place a b31 block at slot 1 and drop it using the ab_drop() function.
ab_drop('b31', 1)

2. Place a b13 block on top of the previous block at slot 1 and drop it.
ab_drop('b13', 1)

3. Place a b31 block on top of the previous block at slot 1 and drop it.
ab_drop('b31', 1)

By following these steps, we can generate a structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Note: This is just an example to illustrate the process. The exact sequence and positions may vary depending on the constraints and desired character shape.
