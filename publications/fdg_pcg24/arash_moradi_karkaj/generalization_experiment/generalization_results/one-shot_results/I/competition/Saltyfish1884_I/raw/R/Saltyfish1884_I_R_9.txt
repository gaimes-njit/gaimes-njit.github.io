To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b31 block on the solid base, aligned at the desired slot position:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will drop a b31 block at slot 1 and land it on the base.

3. Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block, aligned at the same slot position:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
This will drop a b13 block at slot 1 and land it on top of the b31 block.

4. Place another b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned at the same slot position:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will drop another b31 block at slot 1 and land it on top of the b13 block.

The final structure will resemble the character "R" and meet all the hard constraints, including stability and no boundary intrusion.
