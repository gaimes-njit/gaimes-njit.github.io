To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the center slot (y=10) to form the bottom of the "S" shape. This satisfies the stability constraint, as the block is placed on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks):
```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

3. Drop a b13 block at the center slot (y=10) on top of the previous block. This will create the middle part of the "S" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

4. Drop another b31 block at the center slot (y=9) on top of the previous block. This will complete the top part of the "S" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "S" and meet all the given constraints.

Note: The exact slot numbers and block types may vary depending on the specific requirements of the problem. The above steps provide a general approach to generating a stable structure that resembles the character "S" while satisfying the given constraints.
