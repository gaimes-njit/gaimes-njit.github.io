To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S", we need to carefully consider the constraints and the shape of the structure.

Based on the stability constraint, we know that a b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Therefore, we should start by placing the b31 block at a low position in the structure.

Considering the shape of the character "S", we can start by placing a b31 block at the bottom left corner of the structure. This will serve as the base for the structure. To meet the stability constraint, we can place a b13 block above the b31 block, aligned with its center. This will create the first "S" shape.

Next, we can place a b31 block above the b13 block, aligned with its center. This will create the middle part of the "S" shape.

To complete the "S" shape, we need to place the remaining b13 block diagonally above the existing blocks. We can align its center with the top right corner of the last b31 block.

Using the ab_drop() function, we can generate the code to place the suitable blocks in the required positions to form the structure that resembles the given character "S". The code to generate the structure would be as follows:

```
# Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the first b31 block at the bottom left corner
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# Drop the first b13 block above the b31 block
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Drop the second b31 block above the first b13 block
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# Drop the second b13 block diagonally above the second b31 block
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

This code will generate a stable structure resembling the character "S" while satisfying all the hard constraints. The placement of the blocks follows the step-by-step approach, considering the stability constraints and the shape of the structure.
