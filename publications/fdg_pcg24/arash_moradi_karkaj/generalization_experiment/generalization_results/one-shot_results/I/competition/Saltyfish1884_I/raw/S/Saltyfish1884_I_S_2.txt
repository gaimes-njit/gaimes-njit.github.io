To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S" using the ab_drop() python function, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure
Start by initializing the empty structure as a WxH grid using the provided code:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base blocks
To ensure stability, we need to start by placing blocks at the bottom layer to form a solid base. Since a b31 block must be placed on a solid base, we can use two b11 blocks on either side of the structure:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)   # Place the left b11 block
ab_drop('b11', W-1) # Place the right b11 block
```

Step 3: Place the top blocks
Next, we need to place blocks at the top layer of the structure to form the top curve of the "S". We can use three b13 blocks and place them at the center and two sides:

```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2)      # Place the center b13 block
ab_drop('b13', (W//2)-1)  # Place the left b13 block
ab_drop('b13', (W//2)+1)  # Place the right b13 block
```

Step 4: Place the middle blocks
Finally, we need to place blocks in the middle layers of the structure to form the middle curve of the "S". We can use three b31 blocks and place them at different heights:

```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)        # Place the center b31 block
ab_drop('b31', (W//2)-1)    # Place the left b31 block
ab_drop('b31', (W//2)+1)    # Place the right b31 block
```

By following these steps, you should be able to use the ab_drop() function to generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S" while meeting all the given hard constraints. Note that the order and positions of the blocks are crucial to ensure stability, so make sure to follow the steps in the given sequence.
