To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks to ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieving the goal:

Step 1: Initialize the structure
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the first block (b31) at slot 0 to create a solid base
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

Step 3: Drop the second block (b13) at slot 0 to extend the base vertically
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

Step 4: Drop the third block (b31) at slot 3 to create the upper part of the "S"
```python
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Step 5: Drop the fourth block (b13) at slot 4 to extend the upper part of the "S" vertically
```python
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Step 6: Drop the fifth block (b31) at slot 7 to create the lower part of the "S"
```python
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

Step 7: Drop the sixth block (b13) at slot 8 to extend the lower part of the "S" vertically
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

Step 8: The structure now resembles the character "S" and meets all hard constraints

The final code to generate the structure would look like:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

Note: This is just one possible arrangement of the blocks that meets the goal. You can experiment with different dropping positions and orders to achieve different structures resembling the character "S" while still meeting the given constraints.
