To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S", we can follow the following steps:

1. First, we need to drop a b13 block on slot 0 to act as the solid base. This ensures stability and prevents the structure from collapsing.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

2. Next, we can drop the first b31 block slightly to the right of the base to create the vertical part of the "S". We will drop it on slot 1 to keep it stable and prevent overhangs.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Now, we will drop a b13 block on top of the previous one in slot 1 to create the horizontal part of the "S".

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Finally, we will drop the second b31 block on top of the structure, slightly to the right of the vertical part.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "S" and satisfy the stability constraints.

Note: The specific slots and block types used in the example above may vary depending on the final desired structure and the exact position of the character "S" on the map.
