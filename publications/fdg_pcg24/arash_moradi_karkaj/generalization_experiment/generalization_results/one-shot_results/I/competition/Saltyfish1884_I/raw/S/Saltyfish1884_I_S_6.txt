To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure grid using the provided code:
   
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. To meet stability constraint 5.1, we need to ensure that the structure is stable and does not collapse. For the character "S", we can start by placing a b31 block on the base to serve as the bottom part.

   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

3. In order to create the curved shape of the "S", we can use two b13 blocks stacked vertically on top of the b31 block. Place these blocks in slot 1 to maintain stability.

   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

4. To complete the top part of the "S", we need to place another b31 block on top of the b13 blocks. This block needs to be placed on the base as well to maintain stability.

   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

The final structure will resemble the character "S" and will meet all the given constraints. However, please note that the exact slot positions and order of dropping may vary based on the specific implementation of the `ab_drop()` function and the stability rules applied.
