To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S" using the ab_drop() function, we need to consider the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Since the character "S" has two vertical blocks (b13) and two horizontal blocks (b31), we can start by dropping the two vertical blocks at slot 1 and slot 2. This will form the two vertical segments of the "S" shape.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Next, we need to drop the two horizontal blocks to connect the vertical segments. To ensure stability, we should drop the bottom horizontal block (b31) on the solid base formed by the two vertical blocks. We can align the center of the horizontal block with the centers of the two vertical blocks (slot 1 and 2), as shown below:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Finally, the "S" structure should be complete. The resulting structure should resemble the character "S" while meeting all the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

The final Python code to generate the "S" structure would be:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Note that the specific arrangement of slots and order of block placements may vary based on the implementation of the ab_drop() function and the exact placement technique used. The above code provides a general idea of how to approach the problem.
