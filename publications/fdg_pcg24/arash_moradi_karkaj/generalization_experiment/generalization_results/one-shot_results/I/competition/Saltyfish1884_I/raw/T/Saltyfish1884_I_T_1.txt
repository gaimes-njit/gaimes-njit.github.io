To generate a structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.

structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

Step 2: Drop the b31 block at slot 1.

ab_drop('b31', 1)

Step 3: Drop the b13 block at slot 10.

ab_drop('b13', 10)

Step 4: Drop the b31 block at slot 5.

ab_drop('b31', 5)

The resulting structure will resemble the character "T". You can print the structure to see the final result.

print(structure)
