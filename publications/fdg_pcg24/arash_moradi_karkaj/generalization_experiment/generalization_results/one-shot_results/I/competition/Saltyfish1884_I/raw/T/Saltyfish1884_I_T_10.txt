To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while satisfying all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Define the structure size and initialize the structure grid.
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the base block (b11) to the bottom layer (0) and align its center at slot 9 (middle of the structure).
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

Step 3: Drop the vertical block (b13) on top of the base block to form the vertical part of the "T" character. Align its center at slot 9.
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Step 4: Drop the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block to form the cross part of the "T" character. Align its center at slot 9.
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 5: Check the stability of the structure. Ensure that the b31 block is placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) and that the overall structure is stable and not separated.

Step 6: Verify that the structure does not intrude on the map's boundary. Make sure that no blocks extend beyond slots 0 and 19 or layers 0 and 15.

Step 7: If the structure is stable and does not violate any boundary intrusions, the goal is achieved. Otherwise, adjust the dropping position and order of the blocks to meet all constraints.

The final structure will resemble the character "T" and satisfy all given requirements.
