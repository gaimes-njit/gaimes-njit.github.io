To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the base of the "T" structure using b11 blocks. Since the base needs to be stable, we should drop the blocks at the bottom of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

3. Drop the vertical b13 block to form the middle part of the "T" structure. We want to place it as low as possible while still maintaining stability:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

4. Finally, drop the top horizontal b31 block to complete the "T" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

The complete code to generate the "T" structure would be:
```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# drop the base b11 blocks
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)

# drop the vertical b13 block
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# drop the top horizontal b31 block
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while satisfying all the given constraints.
