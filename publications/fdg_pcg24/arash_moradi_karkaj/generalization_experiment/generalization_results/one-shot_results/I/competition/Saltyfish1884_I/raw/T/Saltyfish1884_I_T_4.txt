To generate a structure that resembles the character "T", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the b31 block on the base: 
   - Use the ab_drop() function to drop a b31 block at slot 9.
   
2. Place the b13 block on top of the b31 block: 
   - Use the ab_drop() function to drop a b13 block at slot 9.

3. Place the second b31 block on top of the b13 block: 
   - Use the ab_drop() function to drop a b31 block at slot 9.

The resulting code to generate the "T" structure would be:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

By executing this code, the blocks will be placed in a stable manner, meeting all the hard constraints, and forming a structure that resembles the character "T".
