To generate a stable structure resembling the character "T" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully consider the constraints and plan the block placement step by step.

First, let's analyze the stability constraints:
1) A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
2) Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
3) The structure should not be separated.

Based on these constraints, we can determine the shape of the structure. The character "T" has a horizontal bar (b31 block) at the top and a vertical bar (b13 block) in the middle. So, we need to place the b31 block first on the base (layer 0) and then the b13 block on top of it.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. Initialize the structure:
```
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will drop the b31 block centered at slot 1. The block will land on the base because it must be placed on a solid base.

3. Place the b13 block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
This will drop the b13 block centered at slot 1. The block will land on top of the b31 block since it is the only solid base available.

4. Place the second b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will drop the b31 block centered at slot 1. The block will land on top of the b13 block, completing the structure resembling the character "T".

The final structure will be a stable "T" shape with the b31 block at the top and the b13 block in the middle.

Note: The slot number 1 was chosen based on the given example. You may need to adjust the slot number based on the exact position where you want to place the character "T".
