To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
   `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) on the bottom layer (layer 0) to create a solid base. This ensures stability and prevents overhangs.
   - For the character "T", we can use a b11 block in the center and two b11 blocks on either side, forming a horizontal line.
   - Example:
     ```
     ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Place the center b11 block at slot 9
     ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Place the left b11 block at slot 8
     ab_drop('b11', 10) # Place the right b11 block at slot 10
     ```

3. Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the base blocks to form the vertical line of the "T" character.
   - For the character "T", we can place a b13 block centered above the previously placed b11 block.
   - Example:
     ```
     ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place the b13 block above the center b11 block at slot 9
     ```

4. Finally, place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block to complete the "T" structure.
   - For the character "T", we can place a b31 block centered above the previously placed b13 block.
   - Example:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place the b31 block above the b13 block at slot 9
     ```

By following these steps, the ab_drop() function can be used to put suitable blocks and generate a stable structure resembling the character "T".
