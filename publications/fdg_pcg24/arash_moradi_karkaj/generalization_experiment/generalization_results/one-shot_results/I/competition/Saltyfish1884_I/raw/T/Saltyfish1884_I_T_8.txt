To generate a structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. 

First, let's analyze the stability constraints:
1. A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
2. Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
3. Structure should not be separated.

Based on these stability constraints, we can determine the shape of the structure:
- The base will be a row of b11 blocks to provide a solid foundation for the b31 block.
- The b31 block will be placed on top of the b11 row, centered in the middle slots.
- Finally, a b13 block will be placed on top of the b31 block to complete the structure resembling the character "T".

Now, let's use the ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks to form the structure:

```python
# Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Define the ab_drop() function
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Place the blocks to form the structure
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(row)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "T" and meet all the given constraints. Note that the slot numbers may need to be adjusted based on the desired position of the structure on the map.
