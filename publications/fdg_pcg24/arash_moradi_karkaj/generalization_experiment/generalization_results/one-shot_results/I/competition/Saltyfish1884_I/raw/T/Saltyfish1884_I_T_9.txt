To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at slot 1 to form the vertical part of the "T" shape, considering the stability constraint:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Next, drop a b13 block at slot 1 to form the horizontal part of the "T":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Finally, drop another b31 block at slot 1 to complete the vertical part of the "T" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "T" and meet all the stability and boundary constraints.

Note: The example code provided in part 6 is specific to the goal of generating a structure resembling the character "I". For the character "T", the placement and order of the blocks need to be adjusted accordingly.
