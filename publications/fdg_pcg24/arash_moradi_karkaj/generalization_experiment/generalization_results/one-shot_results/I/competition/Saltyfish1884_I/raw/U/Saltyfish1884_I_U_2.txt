To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "U" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop a b31 block at slot 0 to create the left vertical line of the "U":
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   ```

3. Drop a b31 block at slot 19 to create the right vertical line of the "U":
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 19)
   ```

4. Drop a b13 block at slot 1 to connect the top of the left vertical line to the top of the right vertical line:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

5. Drop a b13 block at slot 18 to connect the top of the right vertical line to the top of the left vertical line:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 18)
   ```

6. To meet stability constraints, place b31 blocks on top of the b13 blocks at the bottom to prevent overhangs:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ab_drop('b31', 18)
   ```

7. Finally, to meet the no boundary intrusion constraint, we can drop b11 blocks at the remaining slots within the U shape:
   ```
   for i in range(2, 18):  # slots 2 to 17
       ab_drop('b11', i)
   ```

The final result will be a stable structure that resembles the character "U" and meets all the given constraints.
