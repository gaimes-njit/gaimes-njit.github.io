To generate a structure resembling the character "U" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the dropping position and order of the blocks:
   - Start with dropping a b31 block in the middle slot (slot 9) to create the bottom of the "U" shape.
   - Next, drop a b13 block in the same slot (slot 9) to form the left side of the "U" shape.
   - Finally, drop another b31 block in the middle slot (slot 9) to complete the "U" shape.

2. Update the structure using the ab_drop() function:
   - Initialize the structure as an empty 20x16 grid.
   - Call the ab_drop() function for each block type and slot position to update the structure accordingly.
   - The resulting structure will resemble the character "U" while satisfying the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is the Python code for generating the structure:

```python
# Define the map width and height
W = 20
H = 16

# Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Define the ab_drop() function
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Generate the "U" structure
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The output will be a structure resembling the character "U" while meeting all the specified constraints. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different block types and slot positions to create other structures.
