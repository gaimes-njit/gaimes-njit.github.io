To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "U" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully consider the constraints and determine the dropping position and order of the blocks.

Step 1: Place the base block (b11) on layer 0 at the center slot (slot 9):
ab_drop('b11', 9)

Step 2: Place the two vertical blocks (b13) on the left and right sides of the base block at slots 8 and 10:
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)

Step 3: Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical blocks, slightly offset to the left:
ab_drop('b31', 7)

Step 4: Place another horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical blocks, slightly offset to the right:
ab_drop('b31', 11)

The final structure should resemble the character "U" and meet all the hard constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.

Here is the complete Python code to generate the structure:

ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
