To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "U" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. We can follow these steps:

Step 1: Set up the initial structure as an empty grid.
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Place the first b31 block at the center, aligned with slot 1.
ab_drop('b31', 1)

Step 3: Place the second b13 block on top of the previously dropped block, aligned with slot 1.
ab_drop('b13', 1)

Step 4: Place the third b31 block on top of the previously dropped blocks, aligned with slot 1.
ab_drop('b31', 1)

This sequence of steps will result in a structure that resembles the character "U" while meeting the stability constraint. The first b31 block acts as the base of the structure, preventing overhangs. Placing the blocks as low as possible minimizes the risk of collapsing.

You can adjust the code according to your requirements.
