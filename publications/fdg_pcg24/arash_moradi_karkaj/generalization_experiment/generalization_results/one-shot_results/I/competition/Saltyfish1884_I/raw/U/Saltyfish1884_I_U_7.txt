To generate a structure that resembles the character "U" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at a suitable position and slot:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Drop a b13 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with its center:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Finally, drop another b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with its center:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The above code will generate a structure that resembles the character "U" while satisfying the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints. You can adjust the slot values according to your requirements to achieve the desired structure.
