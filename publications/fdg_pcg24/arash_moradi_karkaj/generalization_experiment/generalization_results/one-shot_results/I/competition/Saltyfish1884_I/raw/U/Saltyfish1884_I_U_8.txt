To generate a structure that resembles the character "U" while meeting all the given constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability and boundary intrusion rules.

First, let's analyze the stability constraints:
- A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
- Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
- The structure should not be separated.

Next, let's consider the boundary intrusion constraint:
- Blocks should not intrude on the map's boundary, both horizontally (W) and vertically (H).

Based on these constraints, we can plan the step-by-step process to create the structure:

Step 1: Set up the base
Since a b31 block must be placed on a solid base, we should start by placing a b11 block at the center slot (slot 10) on the bottom layer (layer 0). This creates a stable base for the structure.

Step 2: Create the two vertical sides of the "U"
To create the vertical sides of the "U," we need to place b13 blocks vertically on both sides of the base. We can start by placing a b13 block at slot 9 on the bottom layer and another b13 block at slot 11 on the bottom layer. This ensures stability by preventing overhangs.

Step 3: Connect the two vertical sides
To connect the two vertical sides and complete the shape of the "U," we need to place b11 blocks horizontally between the top parts of the two vertical sides. We can start by placing a b11 block at slot 8 on the top layer (layer 15) and another b11 block at slot 12 on the top layer. This ensures stability by preventing separation.

Step 4: Adjust the structure for stability
To further enhance stability, we need to fill in the gaps between the existing blocks. We can accomplish this by placing additional b11 blocks on the bottom layer in slots 7, 13, along with slots 7 and 13 on the top layer. This reinforces the structure and reduces the risk of collapsing.

Step 5: Check for boundary intrusion
Finally, we need to make sure that the structure does not intrude on the map's boundaries. We can achieve this by ensuring that no blocks are placed outside the range of the map's width (slots 0-19) or height (layers 0-15).

Using the ab_drop() function, we can implement the above steps as follows:

ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Step 1: Place a b11 block at slot 10 on the bottom layer
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Step 2: Place a b13 block at slot 9 on the bottom layer
ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Step 2: Place a b13 block at slot 11 on the bottom layer
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Step 3: Place a b11 block at slot 8 on the top layer
ab_drop('b11', 12)  # Step 3: Place a b11 block at slot 12 on the top layer
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Step 4: Place a b11 block at slot 7 on the bottom layer
ab_drop('b11', 13)  # Step 4: Place a b11 block at slot 13 on the bottom layer
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Step 4: Place a b11 block at slot 7 on the top layer
ab_drop('b11', 13)  # Step 4: Place a b11 block at slot 13 on the top layer

This sequence of ab_drop() function calls generates a stable structure that resembles the character "U" while meeting all the given constraints.
