To generate a structure that resembles the character "V" while meeting the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. First, initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. To meet stability constraint 5.1, we need to start by dropping a b13 block on the leftmost slot (slot 0) to form the left side of the "V". We can achieve this by calling the `ab_drop()` function as follows:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Next, we need to drop a b31 block on slot 1 to complete the bottom part of the "V" and provide stability. Again, we can use the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Now, we have the left side and bottom of the "V" structure. To complete the right side of the "V", we can drop another b13 block on the rightmost slot (slot 19):
```
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```

5. Finally, we drop another b31 block on slot 18 to complete the top part of the "V" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 18)
```

The complete Python code for generating the "V" structure would look like this:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 19)
ab_drop('b31', 18)
```

Make sure to replace W and H with their actual values (W = 20 and H = 16) before running the code.
