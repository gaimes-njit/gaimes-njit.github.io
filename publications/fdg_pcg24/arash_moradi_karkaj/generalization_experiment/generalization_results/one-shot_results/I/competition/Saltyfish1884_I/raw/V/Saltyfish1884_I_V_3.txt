To generate a stable structure resembling the character "V", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

3. Place the first set of vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

4. Place the horizontal block on top:
```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

5. Adjust the position of the vertical blocks to better resemble the character "V":
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

6. The final structure should resemble the character "V" and satisfy all hard constraints.

The updated Python code should be:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

Note: The exact positions and order of the blocks may vary to achieve a stable structure resembling the character "V". The above steps are just one possible solution.
