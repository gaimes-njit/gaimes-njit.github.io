To generate a stable structure resembling the character "V", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 1, to form the left side of the "V".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 1, to connect the left and right sides of the "V".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 1, to form the right side of the "V".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "V" and will meet all the stability constraints.

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to arrange the blocks while still meeting the constraints.
