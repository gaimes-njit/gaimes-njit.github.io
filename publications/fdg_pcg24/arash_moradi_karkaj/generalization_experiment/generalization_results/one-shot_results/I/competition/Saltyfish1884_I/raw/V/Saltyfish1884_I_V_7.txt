To generate a structure that resembles the character "V", we can start by analyzing the constraints. 

Constraint 5.1 states that stability is crucial. Based on the stability rules, we need to ensure that a b31 block is placed on a solid base to prevent overhangs. Additionally, blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing and the structure should not be separated.

Constraint 5.2 states that there should be no boundary intrusion. This means that blocks should not intrude on the map's boundary.

Based on these constraints, we can devise a step-by-step plan to generate the desired structure using the ab_drop() function:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.
2. Drop a b31 block at a suitable slot that aligns with the center of the character "V". This block will serve as the base of the structure.
3. Drop a b13 block on top of the base block, aligning the center with the same slot as the base block.
4. Drop another b31 block on top of the previous block, aligning the center with the same slot as the base and middle blocks.

The resulting structure should resemble the character "V" while meeting all the constraints.

Here is an example code snippet to generate the structure:

```python
# Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks to form the structure
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

In the above code snippet, the slots for dropping the blocks are chosen arbitrarily as an example. You may need to adjust the slot numbers based on your specific requirements.
