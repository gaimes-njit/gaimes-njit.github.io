To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "V" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks.

Based on the stability constraints, we can start by placing a base block (b11 or b13) at the bottom layer of the structure. Let's choose b11 for simplicity.
```
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Next, we can place a b31 block on top of the base to create the top part of the "V" shape.
```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Now, we need to create the two sides of the "V" shape. To do this, we can place two b31 blocks on either side of the base block, slightly offset from the center.
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

To complete the structure, we can place a b13 block on top of each b31 block to form the pointed ends of the "V".
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "V" and should meet all the stability and boundary constraints.

Here is the complete code to generate the desired structure:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Please note that the specific positions and order of the blocks may vary slightly, as long as they meet all the constraints.
