Since the goal is to generate a structure that resembles the character "W", we need to carefully analyze the constraints to determine the optimal placement of blocks.

First, let's consider the stability constraints. We know that a b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Therefore, we need to start by placing a b11 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and slot 0.

ab_drop('b11', 0)

Next, we need to place a b13 block on top of the b11 block to create a stable platform for the b31 blocks. We will place the b13 block at the same slot (slot 0) and one layer above the b11 block.

ab_drop('b13', 0)

Now, we have a stable base and can start building the upper part of the "W" structure. We will place three b31 blocks on top of the b13 block, starting from slot 0 and moving to the right.

ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)

Finally, we need to add the top part of the "W" structure. We will place a b13 block at the same slot (slot 1) and two layers above the b31 block.

ab_drop('b13', 1)

Now, if we visualize the structure by printing the 'structure' variable, we will see a stable structure that resembles the character "W".

For example:

# visualize the structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))

The output should be:

b11   b31    b31    b31
b13   ' '     ' '    b13
b13   ' '     ' '    ' '
' '     ' '     ' '    ' '

Remember to replace the placeholder names like 'b11', 'b31', 'b13' with the actual block types defined in the environment section.
