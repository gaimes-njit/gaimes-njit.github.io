To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "W" while meeting all the constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks.

1. Stability Constraints:
- Start by placing a b31 block at the center slot (slot 10) and the bottom layer (layer 0) to form the middle part of the "W". This satisfies the stability rule that a b31 block must be placed on a solid base.
- Next, place a b11 block on the leftmost slot (slot 0) and the layer above the base (layer 1) to form the left bottom part of the "W".
- Then, place another b11 block on the rightmost slot (slot 19) and the layer above the base (layer 1) to form the right bottom part of the "W".
- Finally, place a b13 block in the center slot (slot 10) and the layer above the base (layer 2) to form the top part of the "W".

2. No Boundary Intrusion Constraint:
- By following the above stability constraints, the structure does not intrude on the map's boundary, satisfying the no boundary intrusion constraint.

The Python code to generate the structure would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 10)    # Place b31 block at the center slot and the bottom layer
ab_drop('b11', 0)     # Place b11 block at the leftmost slot and the layer above the base
ab_drop('b11', 19)    # Place b11 block at the rightmost slot and the layer above the base
ab_drop('b13', 10)    # Place b13 block at the center slot and the layer above the base
```

This will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "W" while meeting all the hard constraints.
