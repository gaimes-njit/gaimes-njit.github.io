To generate a structure that resembles the character "W" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code: 
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Place the first b31 block at an appropriate slot to form the leftmost part of the "W". To satisfy the stability constraint, drop it on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks). For example, we can drop it at slot 1 using the ab_drop() function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

3. Place the second b13 block above the first block to form the left diagonal part of the "W". Again, drop it on a solid base. For example, we can drop it at slot 1 using the ab_drop() function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

4. Place the third b31 block above the second block to complete the leftmost part of the "W". Drop it on the base or any solid blocks below. For example, we can drop it at slot 1 using the ab_drop() function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

5. Place the fourth b31 block at an appropriate slot to form the rightmost part of the "W". Drop it on the base or any solid blocks below. For example, we can drop it at slot 18 using the ab_drop() function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 18)
   ```

6. Place the fifth b13 block above the fourth block to form the right diagonal part of the "W". Drop it on the base or any solid blocks below. For example, we can drop it at slot 18 using the ab_drop() function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 18)
   ```

7. Place the sixth b31 block above the fifth block to complete the rightmost part of the "W". Drop it on the base or any solid blocks below. For example, we can drop it at slot 18 using the ab_drop() function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 18)
   ```

8. After executing the above steps, the structure should resemble the character "W" while satisfying the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Note: The exact slot positions for placing the blocks may vary depending on the desired size and spacing of the "W" structure within the given W slots. You can adjust the slot numbers in the ab_drop() function calls based on your preferences.
