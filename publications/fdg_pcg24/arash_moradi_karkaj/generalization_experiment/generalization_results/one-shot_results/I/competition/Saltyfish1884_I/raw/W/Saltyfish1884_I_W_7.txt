To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "W", we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid using the provided code.
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Place a horizontal block (b31) on the bottom layer (layer 0) at slot position 1 to start forming the left side of the "W".
ab_drop('b31', 1)

Step 3: Place a vertical block (b13) on the bottom layer (layer 0) at slot position 1 to form the central part of the "W".
ab_drop('b13', 1)

Step 4: Place another horizontal block (b31) on the bottom layer (layer 0) at slot position 1 to complete the left side of the "W".
ab_drop('b31', 1)

Step 5: Place a horizontal block (b31) on the bottom layer (layer 0) at slot position 9 to start forming the right side of the "W".
ab_drop('b31', 9)

Step 6: Place a vertical block (b13) on the bottom layer (layer 0) at slot position 9 to form the central part of the "W".
ab_drop('b13', 9)

Step 7: Place another horizontal block (b31) on the bottom layer (layer 0) at slot position 9 to complete the right side of the "W".
ab_drop('b31', 9)

The above steps will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "W" while meeting the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Please note that the provided code only shows how to use the ab_drop() function to place the blocks in the desired positions. You may need to modify the slot positions and order of block placement according to the specific requirements or constraints of the "W" shape.
