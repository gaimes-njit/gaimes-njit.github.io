To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "W" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping position and order of the blocks to create the "W" shape. 

To satisfy the stability constraint, we need to ensure that the blocks are placed on a solid base and as low as possible. In this case, we can start by dropping the b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) at the center (slot 10). We can use the `ab_drop()` function for this:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

Next, we drop two b13 blocks on either side of the b31 block at slots 8 and 12 to create the upper branches of the "W":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
```

To complete the lower branches of the "W", we can drop two b31 blocks on slots 5 and 15, aligning them with the top corners of the b13 blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 15)
```

Finally, to prevent any separation in the structure, we can drop two b11 blocks on slots 7 and 14 between the b31 blocks and the b13 blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 14)
```

The overall Python code to generate the "W" structure would be:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 15)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 14)
```

After executing this code, the `structure` grid will contain the stable structure resembling the character "W" while satisfying all hard constraints.
