To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability rules and constraints.

Step 1: Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid.

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the first block, 'b31', on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. We can drop it at the center of slot 1.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 3: Place the second block, 'b13', just below the first block to form the vertical part of the "X". We can drop it at the center of slot 1.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Step 4: Place the third block, 'b31', on the higher level to form the horizontal part of the "X". We can drop it at the center of slot 1.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 5: The final structure resembles the character "X" and meets all the given constraints.

```python
print(structure)
```

The final result will be a grid showing the structure resembling the character "X" while meeting all hard constraints.
