To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X", we can divide the process into several steps:

Step 1: Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) at the bottom layer (layer 0) to form a solid base. This will provide stability for the structure.

Step 2: Place two b31 blocks diagonally at the center of the structure. These blocks will form the diagonal lines of the "X" character.

Step 3: Place two b13 blocks vertically above the b31 blocks, aligned with the center slot of each b31 block. These blocks will connect the diagonal lines of the "X" character.

Step 4: Place two b31 blocks diagonally above the b13 blocks, aligned with the center slot of each b31 block. These blocks will create the top part of the "X" character.

Step 5: Place additional b11 or b13 blocks at the remaining empty slots to ensure stability and prevent the structure from collapsing.

Here is the Python code to generate the structure:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 1: Place the base blocks at the bottom layer
for slot in range(W):
    ab_drop('b13', slot)

# Step 2: Place the diagonal b31 blocks
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 15)

# Step 3: Place the vertical b13 blocks
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 15)

# Step 4: Place the diagonal b31 blocks
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 11)

# Step 5: Place additional blocks for stability
for layer in range(1, H):
    for slot in range(W):
        ab_drop('b11', slot)
```

Note: The slot numbers used in the code above are just for illustration purposes. You may need to adjust the slot numbers based on the specific positioning of the blocks to achieve the desired structure resembling the character "X".
