To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. To meet stability constraints, we need to start by placing the base of the structure. We can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block on the solid base (either a b11 or b13 block). Let's place a b11 block as the base:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

3. To create the "X" shape, we need to place a b13 block vertically and b31 blocks horizontally. Let's start by placing the vertical block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Now, we can place two b31 blocks diagonally on top of the b13 block to form the arms of the "X" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

5. Finally, we can place a b31 block horizontally on top of the vertical block to complete the "X" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

The final result will be a stable structure resembling the character "X" while meeting all hard constraints.
