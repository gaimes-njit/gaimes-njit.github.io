To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X", we need to carefully determine the dropping position and order of the blocks. 

First, let's analyze the constraints:
5.1 Stability: 
- We can start by placing a b31 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and its center aligned with slot 1 (y=1), ensuring that it is placed on a solid base.
- Next, we can place a b13 block on top of the b31 block at the same slot position (y=1).
- Finally, we can place another b31 block on top of the b13 block at the same slot position (y=1).

5.2 No boundary intrusion:
- By placing the blocks at slot 1 (y=1), we ensure that there is no boundary intrusion as the width of each block is within the range of the map's boundary.

Now, let's use the ab_drop() function to put the suitable blocks in the desired order and positions:

# Drop the first b31 block at slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Drop the b13 block on top of the b31 block at slot 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Drop the second b31 block on top of the b13 block at slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)

The final structure will resemble the character "X" and meet all the given constraints.
