To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X" and meets all the hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability rules and no boundary intrusion constraint.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve that:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

2. Drop the first b31 block on the left side:
ab_drop('b31', 1)

3. Drop the second b13 block on the left side, below the first block:
ab_drop('b13', 1)

4. Drop the third b31 block on the right side:
ab_drop('b31', 18)

5. Drop the fourth b13 block on the right side, below the third block:
ab_drop('b13', 18)

After following these steps, the structure will resemble the character "X" and meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

The code to generate this structure would be:
---
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 18)
ab_drop('b13', 18)
