To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Consider the stability constraints. Since we need to place a b31 block on a solid base, we can start by dropping a b11 block at the bottom-middle slot (slot 10):
```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

Step 3: To create the slanted sides of the "X", we need to drop b13 blocks diagonally from the top corners towards the center. We can achieve this by dropping a b13 block at slot 5 and another at slot 15. Since these blocks should be placed as low as possible, we need to ensure there are no obstacles in their paths. We can achieve this by starting from the top layer (layer 15) and dropping the b13 blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 15)
```

Step 4: Finally, to complete the top part of the "X", we need to drop a b31 block on top of the b11 block at slot 10:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

By following these steps, we have generated a stable structure that resembles the character "X" while meeting all the given constraints.
