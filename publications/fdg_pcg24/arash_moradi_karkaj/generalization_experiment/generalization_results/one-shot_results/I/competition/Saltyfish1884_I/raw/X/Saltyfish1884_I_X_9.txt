In order to generate a structure that resembles the character "X" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks.

First, let's analyze the stability constraint. We know that a b31 block must be placed on a solid base to prevent overhangs. Therefore, we need to start by placing a b11 or b13 block at the center slot (slot 10) to act as the base.

Next, we should place a b31 block directly above the base block at slot 10. This will create the middle section of the "X" shape. 

Then, we should place another b11 or b13 block diagonally above and to the left of the center slot (slot 8) to act as a support for the left section of the "X" shape.

Similarly, we should place another b11 or b13 block diagonally above and to the right of the center slot (slot 12) to act as a support for the right section of the "X" shape.

Finally, we can complete the structure by placing a b31 block directly above the left support block at slot 8, and another b31 block directly above the right support block at slot 12. This will form the top section of the "X" shape.

The Python code to generate this structure would be:

---
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
---

Please note that this is just one possible solution that meets all the given requirements.
