To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Y" using the ab_drop() function, we need to follow the given constraints and think step by step:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid: 
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Place the bottom part of the "Y" shape by dropping a b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks):
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Place the vertical part of the "Y" shape by dropping a b13 block on top of the b31 block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Place the top part of the "Y" shape by dropping another b31 block on top of the b13 block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

The final code to generate the "Y" shape would be as follows:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

This code will create a stable structure that resembles the character "Y" while meeting all the hard constraints.
