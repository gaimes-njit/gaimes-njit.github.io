To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Y" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base of the "Y" structure by dropping a b31 block on layer 0 and slot 9 by calling the `ab_drop('b31', 9)` function.

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Place the two arms of the "Y" structure by dropping a b13 block on layer 1 and slots 8 and 10 by calling the `ab_drop('b13', slot)` function.

```
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

4. Place the vertical line of the "Y" structure by dropping a b31 block on layer 4 and slot 9 by calling the `ab_drop('b31', 9)` function.

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

5. Print the final structure to see the result:
```
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The final structure should resemble the character "Y" and meet all hard constraints.

Note: The specific slot numbers and order of block placements may vary, but the general steps above should result in a stable structure that resembles the character "Y".
