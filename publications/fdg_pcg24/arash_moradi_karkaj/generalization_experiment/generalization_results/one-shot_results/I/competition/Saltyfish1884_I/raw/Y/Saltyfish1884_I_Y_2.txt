To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Y", we can use the ab_drop() function to strategically place blocks in a step-by-step manner. Here is the approach to follow:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) to establish a solid foundation:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```
This will create a stable base for the structure, occupying slots 9, 10, and 11.

Step 3: Place the inclined parts of the "Y":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```
These blocks will create the angled arms of the "Y", occupying slots 6-8 and 12-14.

Step 4: Place the connecting part of the "Y":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```
These blocks will create the vertical stem of the "Y", occupying slots 9-11.

Step 5: Place the upper part of the "Y":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 12)
ab_drop('b11', 13)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```
These blocks will create the upper part of the "Y", occupying slots 5-14.

Step 6: The resulting structure will resemble the character "Y" when viewed on the grid. The final structure will be stable and meet the hard constraints.

Note: This is just one possible approach to generate the structure resembling the character "Y" using the ab_drop() function. The specific slot positions and order of block placements can be adjusted to achieve alternative stable structures that resemble the character.
