To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Y", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks to form a solid foundation for the structure. We can use the ab_drop() function to drop b11 blocks at suitable slots along the bottom layer (layer 0).

```python
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Drops a b11 block at slot 6
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Drops a b11 block at slot 7
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Drops a b11 block at slot 8
```

3. Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the base to form the center part of the "Y". We can also use the ab_drop() function to drop the b13 block at the suitable slot, overlapping the base blocks partially.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Drops a b13 block at slot 7 (centered over the base)
```

4. Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the center part to form the two arms of the "Y". Again, we use the ab_drop() function to drop the b31 block at the suitable slot, overlapping the center block partially.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Drops a b31 block at slot 6 (left arm)
ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Drops a b31 block at slot 8 (right arm)
```

The final result should be a stable structure resembling the character "Y". You can modify the slot numbers and block types to generate different variations of the structure. Remember to ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion according to the given constraints.
