To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Y" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block 'b31' (horizontal block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit) at slot 1 to create the upper part of the "Y" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Drop the second block 'b13' (vertical block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units) at slot 1 to create the middle part of the "Y" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Drop the third block 'b31' (horizontal block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit) at slot 1 to create the lower part of the "Y" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "Y". Make sure to follow the stability rules and place the blocks as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
