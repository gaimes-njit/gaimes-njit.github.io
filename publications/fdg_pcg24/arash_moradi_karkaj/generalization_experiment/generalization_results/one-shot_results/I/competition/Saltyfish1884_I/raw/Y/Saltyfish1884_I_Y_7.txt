To generate a stable structure resembling the character "Y" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by placing the b31 block at a suitable position to form the vertical stem of the "Y". We can place it at slot 1 to ensure stability:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Place the b13 block on top of the b31 block to form the upper part of the "Y". Again, we can place it at slot 1:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. To form the lower parts of the "Y", we can place two b31 blocks on the sides. We can place them at slots 0 and 2 to ensure stability:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

5. The resulting structure should resemble the character "Y" and meet the stability constraints. The final Python code would be:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure resembling the character "Y" while meeting all hard constraints.
