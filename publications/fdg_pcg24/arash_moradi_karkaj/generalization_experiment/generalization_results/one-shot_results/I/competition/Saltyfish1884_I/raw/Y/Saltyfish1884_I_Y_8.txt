To generate a structure that resembles the character "Y" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here's an approach to achieve this:

1. Place the base: The base of the structure should be a solid block (b11 or b13) to provide stability. Use the ab_drop() function to drop a solid block at the center slot (slot 10) of the bottom layer (layer 0). This will serve as the base for the entire structure.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

2. Build the vertical part of the "Y": The vertical part of the "Y" should be a vertical block (b13) placed on top of the base block. Use the ab_drop() function to drop a vertical block at the center slot (slot 10) of the second layer (layer 1).

```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

3. Build the horizontal part of the "Y": The horizontal part of the "Y" should be formed by two horizontal blocks (b31) placed symmetrically on top of the vertical block. Use the ab_drop() function to drop a horizontal block at the leftmost slot (slot 0) of the third layer (layer 2) and another horizontal block at the rightmost slot (slot 19) of the third layer (layer 2).

```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 19)
```

4. Ensure stability: To ensure stability, make sure the blocks are placed as low as possible to minimize the risk of collapsing.

5. Avoid boundary intrusion: The blocks should not intrude on the map's boundaries. Make sure the area of intrusion regions is zero by adjusting the dropping positions accordingly.

The final structure will resemble the character "Y" and meet all the hard constraints.

Remember to replace the example code provided in part 6 with the code generated following this approach. This approach focuses on the stability and shape of the structure to resemble the character "Y" while considering the constraints mentioned in part 5.
