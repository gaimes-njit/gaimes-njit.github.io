To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Z" using the ab_drop() python function, we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Place the base blocks
Since stability is a hard constraint, we need to start by placing a solid base for the structure. In this case, we can use two b11 blocks side by side to form the bottom layer of the structure.

ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)

Step 2: Place the vertical block
Next, we need to place the vertical block (b13) on top of the base blocks. It should be aligned with the center of the structure.

ab_drop('b13', 9)

Step 3: Place the horizontal block
Finally, we place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block. It should be aligned with the center of the structure.

ab_drop('b31', 9)

By following these steps, we will have a stable structure that resembles the character "Z" using the ab_drop() python function.
