To generate a stable structure resembling the character "Z", we can follow the step-by-step process:

1. Understand the constraints:

- Stability: A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing, and the structure should not be separated.
- No boundary intrusion: Blocks should not intrude on the map's boundary, both in terms of width and height.

2. Determine the shape of the structure:

Based on the character "Z", we can visualize the structure as follows:

```
xxxxx
   xx
   xx
xxxxx
```

3. Generate the structure using the ab_drop() function:

Using the ab_drop() function, we need to strategically drop the blocks to form the structure while meeting the stability and boundary constraints.

Here is one way to generate the structure:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks to form the "Z" structure
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the first 'b31' block in slot 2
ab_drop('b11', 0)  # Place the 'b11' block on the base, aligned with the first 'b31' block
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place another 'b11' block on the base, aligned with the first 'b31' block
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the second 'b31' block one layer above the base, aligned with the lower 'b11' block

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This will create a stable structure resembling the character "Z" while meeting all the given constraints. Adjust the drop positions and order as needed to achieve different stable structures.
