To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Z" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the step-by-step process:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Step 2: Place the base blocks to create a solid base
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Step 3: Place the vertical block on top of the base blocks
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal block on the top left of the vertical block
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

Step 5: Place the horizontal block on the top right of the vertical block
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The final structure will resemble the character "Z".

The complete Python code to generate the structure is:
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)

ab_drop('b13', 1)

ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
