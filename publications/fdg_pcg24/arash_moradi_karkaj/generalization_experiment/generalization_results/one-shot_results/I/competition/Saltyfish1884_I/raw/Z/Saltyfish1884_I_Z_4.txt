To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Z" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the blocks to form the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a b31 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a b11 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a b31 block in slot 2
ab_drop('b11', 0)  # Place a b11 block in slot 0
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a b31 block in slot 1
```

The above code will generate a structure that resembles the character "Z" while meeting the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints.

Note: The slot numbers and block types used in the above code are just for illustration purposes. The actual slot numbers and block types may vary depending on the desired structure.
