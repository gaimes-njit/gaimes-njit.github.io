To generate a stable structure resembling the character "Z", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base of the structure using the ab_drop() function to drop a b11 block at the bottom layer, somewhere near the middle of the map:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

3. Next, drop a b31 block on top of the base to create the top part of the "Z" shape. Place it slightly to the left of the center to create an inclined shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

4. To complete the "Z" shape, drop a b13 block to connect the top part with the base:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

5. The resulting structure should resemble the character "Z":
```
         #
       ##
      #
```
Note that the slots and layers mentioned here are indices starting from 0. Adjust the coordinates according to the actual indices in the problem setup.

Make sure to evaluate the stability of the structure at each step to ensure that the blocks are placed in a stable manner. Additionally, check for any boundary intrusion and adjust the drop positions accordingly to meet the given constraints.
