To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Z" using the ab_drop() function, the following steps can be followed:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Based on the goal, determine the dropping position and order of the blocks. In this case, the shape of the structure should have a horizontal block (b31) at the bottom and a vertical block (b13) on top of it.

3. Vertically drop the blocks using the ab_drop() function:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

These function calls will drop the blocks of the specified types at the slot position 1, aligning their centers with that slot. The blocks are dropped in the order mentioned above to create the shape of the character "Z".

By following these steps and adjusting the dropping positions and order based on the goal, a stable structure resembling the given character can be generated.
