To generate a structure that resembles the character "Z" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b11 block on the bottom layer at the leftmost slot. This will serve as the base for stability.

```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

3. Place a b31 block on the base, aligned with the center slot. This will create the middle part of the "Z" shape.

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

4. Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with the center slot. This will create the top part of the "Z" shape.

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

5. Place another b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with the center slot. This will create the bottom part of the "Z" shape.

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

The final result will be a structure that resembles the character "Z" and meets all the hard constraints.
