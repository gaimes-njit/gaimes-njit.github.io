To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Z", we need to carefully determine the dropping position and order of the blocks using the ab_drop() function. 

Considering the two constraints mentioned in part 5, we can follow the following steps to form the structure:

Step 1: Drop a b31 block at slot 1 to create a stable base. This block will be the lower part of the "Z" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 2: Drop a b13 block at slot 1 to connect with the base block and create the vertical part of the "Z" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Step 3: Drop another b31 block at slot 2 to complete the upper part of the "Z" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The final result will have a structure resembling the character "Z" while meeting all the hard constraints.

Please note that you can adjust the slot numbers and block types according to the specific requirements of your task.
