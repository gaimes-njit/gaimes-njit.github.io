To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "A", we can break it down into three parts: the top bar, the middle bar, and the bottom bar.

First, we will drop a row block ("b31") at the center of the grid to create the top bar.

Next, we will drop a column block ("b13") slightly below and to the left of the center to create the middle bar.

Finally, we will drop another column block ("b13") slightly below and to the right of the center to create the bottom bar.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 10);  // Drop the top bar
ab_drop("b13", 8);   // Drop the middle bar
ab_drop("b13", 12);  // Drop the bottom bar
```

Make sure to adjust the x_position values to center the blocks properly in the grid.
