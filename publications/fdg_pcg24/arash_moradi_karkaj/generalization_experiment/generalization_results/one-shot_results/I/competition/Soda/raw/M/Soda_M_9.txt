To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital "M", we can break it down into three blocks: two diagonal blocks and one middle block. We can start by dropping the two diagonal blocks first, and then the middle block.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 7)  # Drop the first diagonal block at x_position = 7
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Drop the second diagonal block at x_position = 8
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Drop the middle block at x_position = 9
```

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "M".

Explanation:
- The first diagonal block (b31) is dropped at x_position = 7, which occupies cells (6, 0), (7, 0), and (8, 0).
- The second diagonal block (b13) is dropped at x_position = 8, which occupies cells (7, 1), (7, 0), and (7, -1).
- The middle block (b31) is dropped at x_position = 9, which occupies cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).

The resulting structure will resemble the letter "M".
