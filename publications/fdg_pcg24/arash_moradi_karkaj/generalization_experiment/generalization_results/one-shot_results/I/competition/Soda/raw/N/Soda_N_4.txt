To create a structure in the shape of a capital "N", we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical column blocks on the sides and one horizontal row block in the middle. Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Place the left vertical column block at x_position=4
ab_drop("b13", 15)  # Place the right vertical column block at x_position=15
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Place the horizontal row block at x_position=10

This implementation creates a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "N". The left vertical column block is centered at x_position=4 and occupies cells (3, 0), (4, 0), and (5, 0). The right vertical column block is centered at x_position=15 and occupies cells (14, 0), (15, 0), and (16, 0). The horizontal row block is centered at x_position=10 and occupies cells (9, 0), (10, 0), and (11, 0).

Please note that the implementation assumes that the grid starts from the bottom-left corner at coordinate (0, 0) and ends at the top-right corner at coordinate (W-1, H-1).
