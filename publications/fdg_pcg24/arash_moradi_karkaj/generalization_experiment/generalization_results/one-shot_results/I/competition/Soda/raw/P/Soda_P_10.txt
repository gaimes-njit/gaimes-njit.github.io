To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "P", we can follow these steps:

1. Place a column block "b13" at x_position=2.
2. Place a row block "b31" at x_position=1.
3. Place a row block "b31" at x_position=2.
4. Place a row block "b31" at x_position=3.
5. Place a column block "b13" at x_position=4.
6. Place a column block "b13" at x_position=6.
7. Place a column block "b13" at x_position=8.

Here's the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```
