To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "P" (TARGET) in a level, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the base blocks of the letter "P" horizontally.
1. Drop a row block (b31) at x_position = 5.
ab_drop("b31", 5)

Step 2: Place the vertical bar of the letter "P" on top of the base.
1. Drop a column block (b13) at x_position = 5.
ab_drop("b13", 5)

Step 3: Place the horizontal bar of the letter "P" on top of the vertical bar.
1. Drop a row block (b31) at x_position = 10.
ab_drop("b31", 10)

Overall, the complete implementation to generate the letter "P" structure would be as follows:

ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
