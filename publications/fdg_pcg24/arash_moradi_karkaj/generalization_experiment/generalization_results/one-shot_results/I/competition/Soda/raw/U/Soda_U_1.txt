To create a structure that looks like the letter "U" in the level, we can use a combination of square blocks (b11) and column blocks (b13). 

First, we'll place the base of the "U" shape using column blocks. Then, we'll add the sides of the "U" shape using square blocks. Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Place column block on the left side
ab_drop("b13", 14)  # Place column block on the right side
ab_drop("b11", 5)  # Place square block on the left side
ab_drop("b11", 14)  # Place square block on the right side
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top fashion and ensures stability by placing the blocks in a balanced manner. It also generates a structure that closely resembles the target letter "U".
