To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "U", we can break it down into three blocks: the two vertical lines and the bottom horizontal line. 

First, we will place the two vertical lines using the "b31" block type. We will position the first vertical line at x_position=4 and the second vertical line at x_position=16. This will create the outline of the "U" shape.

Then, we will place the bottom horizontal line using the "b13" block type. We will position it at x_position=10. This will complete the "U" shape.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Place the first vertical line
ab_drop("b31", 4)

# Place the second vertical line
ab_drop("b31", 16)

# Place the bottom horizontal line
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

By following the above code, the structure will look like the capital letter "U" in the level, and it will be stable as each block is balanced and well-supported.
