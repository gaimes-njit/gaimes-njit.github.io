To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "U" in the level, we can use the following steps:

1. Start by dropping a row block ("b31") at the leftmost position of the grid (x_position=0). This will act as the base of the "U" shape.
2. Drop a column block ("b13") at the left side of the base block, centered vertically. This will act as the left side of the "U" shape.
3. Drop another column block ("b13") at the right side of the base block, centered vertically. This will act as the right side of the "U" shape.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)          # Drop the base block
ab_drop("b13", 0)          # Drop the left side block
ab_drop("b13", 2)          # Drop the right side block
```

Please note that we assume the grid is initially empty and that the "U" shape is created in a bottom-to-top fashion, as stated in the problem requirements. Additionally, the positions and order of the blocks are crucial to achieve the desired "U" shape.
