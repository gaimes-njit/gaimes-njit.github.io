To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "V" in the Tetris game, we can start by placing two column blocks ("b13") at the bottom to form the two legs of the "V". The center of the "V" will be empty. Then, we can place a row block ("b31") on top of the two legs to connect them and complete the "V" shape.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Place the two legs of the "V"
ab_drop("b13", 7)   # Left leg
ab_drop("b13", 12)  # Right leg

# Place the connecting block
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # Connecting block
```
In this implementation, the left leg is dropped at x_position=7, which centers the block between columns 6 and 8. Similarly, the right leg is dropped at x_position=12, centering the block between columns 11 and 13. The connecting block is dropped at x_position=9, centering the block between columns 8 and 10.

This implementation ensures that the blocks do not intrude on the boundary and are balanced, resulting in a stable structure. It also creates a structure that closely resembles the capital letter "V".
