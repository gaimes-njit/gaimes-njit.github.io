To build a structure in the shape of a capital Y, we will follow these steps:

1. Place the top part of the Y (the horizontal bar):

```
ab_drop("b31", 5)  # Places the top part at column 5
```

2. Place the left part of the Y (the vertical bar):

```
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Places the left part at column 5
```

3. Place the right part of the Y (the vertical bar):

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)  # Places the right part at column 7
```

The final code block with the complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 5)  # Places the top part at column 5
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Places the left part at column 5
ab_drop("b13", 7)  # Places the right part at column 7
```

This code will generate a stable structure that looks like a capital Y.
