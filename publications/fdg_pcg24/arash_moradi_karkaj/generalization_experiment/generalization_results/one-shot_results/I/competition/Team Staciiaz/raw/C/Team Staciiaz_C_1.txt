To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "C" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define the positions and order to drop the blocks to form the character "C". We need to consider both stability and the constraint of no boundary intrusion.

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks at the determined positions in the specified order. The function takes the block type (`'b11'`, `'b31'`, or `'b13'`) and the slot number (`x_position`) as parameters.

4. Repeat step 3 for all the blocks needed to form the character "C".

Here is a possible implementation to generate the "C" structure:

```python
# Initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # The existing implementation of the ab_drop() function

# Define the block positions and order
blocks = [
    ('b31', 0),  # Drop a horizontal block at slot 0
    ('b13', 1),  # Drop a vertical block at slot 1
    ('b31', 19),  # Drop a horizontal block at slot 19
]

# Drop the blocks to form the character "C"
for block_type, x_position in blocks:
    ab_drop(block_type, x_position)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This implementation drops a horizontal block at slot 0, a vertical block at slot 1, and another horizontal block at slot 19 to form the character "C". The resulting structure will be printed at the end.
