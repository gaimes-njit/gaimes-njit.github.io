To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "E" and meets all the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is a possible solution:

1. Drop the first horizontal block `b31` at slot 3, layer 15. This will form the top line of the "E".

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

2. Drop the second horizontal block `b31` at slot 3, layer 14. This will form the middle line of the "E".

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

3. Drop the first vertical block `b13` at slot 1, layer 15. This will form the left vertical line of the "E".

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Drop the second vertical block `b13` at slot 5, layer 15. This will form the right vertical line of the "E".

```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

5. Drop the third horizontal block `b31` at slot 3, layer 13. This will form the bottom line of the "E".

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

After executing these steps, the `structure` grid will represent a stable structure that looks like the character "E" and meets all the given constraints. Please note that the order and positions of the blocks dropped are crucial to ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion.
