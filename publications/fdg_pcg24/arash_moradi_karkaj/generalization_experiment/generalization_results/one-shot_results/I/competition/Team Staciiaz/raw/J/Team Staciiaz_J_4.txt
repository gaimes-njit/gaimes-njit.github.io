To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "J" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here's how we can approach it:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the drop positions for each block type based on their shape. For the "J" character, we can use the following drop positions:
- Drop b31 block at slot 0 (x_position = 0)
- Drop b13 block at slot 1 (x_position = 1)
- Drop b11 block at slot 2 (x_position = 2)

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop each block at the specified positions:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

4. The resulting structure should resemble the character "J" and meet the stability constraint. You can print the structure to visualize it:
```
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The complete code would look like this:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # ... implementation details of ab_drop function ...

ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)

for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

By following this approach, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "J" and meets all the constraints.
