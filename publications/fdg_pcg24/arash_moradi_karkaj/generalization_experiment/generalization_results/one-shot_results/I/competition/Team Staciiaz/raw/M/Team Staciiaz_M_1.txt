To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "M" and meets all the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in a strategic manner. Here is a possible approach:

1. First, drop a `b13` block at slot 4 using `ab_drop('b13', 4)`. This will be the center of the "M" shape.

2. Next, drop two `b31` blocks on either side of the center. Drop the left `b31` block at slot 2 using `ab_drop('b31', 2)` and the right `b31` block at slot 6 using `ab_drop('b31', 6)`.

3. Finally, drop three `b11` blocks as the upward strokes of the "M". Drop the left `b11` block at slot 1 using `ab_drop('b11', 1)`, the center `b11` block at slot 4 using `ab_drop('b11', 4)`, and the right `b11` block at slot 8 using `ab_drop('b11', 8)`.

This arrangement of blocks will create a stable structure that looks like the character "M" and satisfies the stability constraint. Since the center block is dropped first, the subsequent blocks can be dropped on top of it without causing any imbalance.

To ensure that the structure does not intrude on the boundary of the map, the slot positions chosen for dropping the blocks should be within the range of 0 to 19. Also, make sure to check the validity of the block type and x_position inputs before dropping the blocks, as implemented in the `ab_drop()` function.

Note that there may be multiple valid solutions to achieve the stable structure resembling an "M" shape, depending on the specific slot positions chosen and the order of dropping the blocks. The above approach is just one example.
