To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "N" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we need to carefully choose the dropping positions and order of the blocks.

Here is a step-by-step approach to create the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Start by dropping the vertical block `b13` at slot 2:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

3. Drop the horizontal block `b31` at slot 1, just below the vertical block:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

4. Drop another vertical block `b13` at slot 0, next to the horizontal block:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

5. Finally, drop the square block `b11` at slot 2, above the previous blocks:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 2)
   ```

The final structure will look like the character "N" and will satisfy all the constraints.
