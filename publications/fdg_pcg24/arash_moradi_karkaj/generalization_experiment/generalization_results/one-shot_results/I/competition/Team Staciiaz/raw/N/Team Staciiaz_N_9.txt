To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "N" by using the `ab_drop()` function and meeting the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. First, initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided `Map Initialization` code.

2. Start by dropping the base block `b31` at the center slot of the base layer H=0, slot y=W/2. This will provide a stable foundation for the structure.

```
ab_drop('b31', W/2)
```

3. Next, drop the vertical block `b13` on the left side of the base block to form the left part of the "N" structure. The block should be dropped at a slot y that aligns with the center of the base block.

```
ab_drop('b13', W/2 - 1)
```

4. Then, drop another vertical block `b13` on the right side of the base block to complete the "N" structure. The block should be dropped at a slot y that aligns with the center of the base block.

```
ab_drop('b13', W/2 + 1)
```

The above steps will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "N" and meets the given constraints. The structure will be stored in the `structure` variable.
