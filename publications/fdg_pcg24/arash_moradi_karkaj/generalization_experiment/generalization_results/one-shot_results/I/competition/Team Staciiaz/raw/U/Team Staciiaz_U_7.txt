To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "U" and meets all the constraints, we need to strategically use the `ab_drop()` function.

Here is one possible approach to achieve the goal:

1. Start by dropping a b31 block at slot 8 to create the bottom part of the "U" shape. This block should be centered vertically in the bottom layer. Use `ab_drop('b31', 8)`.

2. Next, drop a b13 block at slot 2 to create the left vertical part of the "U" shape. This block should be aligned with the bottom part. Use `ab_drop('b13', 2)`.

3. Drop another b31 block at slot 14 to create the right vertical part of the "U" shape. This block should also be aligned with the bottom part. Use `ab_drop('b31', 14)`.

4. Finally, drop a b31 block at slot 8 to connect the top parts of the "U" shape. This block should be centered vertically in the top layer. Use `ab_drop('b31', 8)`.

By following this sequence of block drops, the resulting structure will resemble the character "U" while satisfying the stability constraint and avoiding boundary intrusion.

Please note that the specific positions and order of block drops may vary depending on the available slots and the initial state of the structure. The provided approach serves as a general guideline to meet the goal and constraints.
