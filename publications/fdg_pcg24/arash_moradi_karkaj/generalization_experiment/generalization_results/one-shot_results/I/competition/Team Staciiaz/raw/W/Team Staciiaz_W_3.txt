To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" and meets all the constraints, we need to use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a strategic order and position.

Based on the constraints, we can outline the following steps:

1. Drop a b31 block in the center slot (slot 10) of the bottom layer (layer 0) using `ab_drop('b31', 10)`.

2. Drop a b11 block in slots 9 and 11 of the second layer (layer 1) using `ab_drop('b11', 9)` and `ab_drop('b11', 11)`.

3. Drop a b13 block in slots 8, 10, and 12 of the third layer (layer 2) using `ab_drop('b13', 8)`, `ab_drop('b13', 10)`, and `ab_drop('b13', 12)`.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for layers 3 to 7, dropping b11 blocks in the even slots (8, 10, 12, etc.) and b13 blocks in the odd slots (9, 11, 13, etc.).

5. Drop a b11 block in slots 8, 10, and 12 of the eighth layer (layer 7).

6. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for layers 9 to 13, dropping b11 blocks in the even slots (8, 10, 12, etc.) and b13 blocks in the odd slots (9, 11, 13, etc.).

7. Drop a b11 block in slots 9 and 11 of the fourteenth layer (layer 13).

8. Drop a b31 block in the center slot (slot 10) of the fifteenth layer (layer 14).

9. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for layers 15 to 11, dropping b11 blocks in the even slots (8, 10, 12, etc.) and b13 blocks in the odd slots (9, 11, 13, etc.).

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" and meets all the constraints.
