To generate a **stable** structure that looks like the character "W" and meets all the constraints, we will use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a specific order and position.

Here is the step-by-step process to generate the structure:

Step 1: Drop the base blocks (b13) at slots 7, 8, and 11.
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

Step 2: Drop the middle blocks (b31) at slots 6, 9, 10, 12, and 15.
```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 15)
```

Step 3: Drop the top blocks (b11) at slots 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, and 16.
```
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 13)
ab_drop('b11', 14)
ab_drop('b11', 16)
```

After following these steps and dropping the blocks as specified, the generated structure will resemble the character "W" and will meet all the constraints. The stability of the structure is ensured by dropping the blocks in a specific order and position, and no boundary intrusion occurs as the blocks are dropped within the slots of the map.
