To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Z" and meets all the given constraints, we can follow these steps using the `ab_drop()` function:

1. Drop a b11 block at slot 0 to build the left part of the "Z" shape:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 0)
   ```

2. Drop a b31 block at slot 1 to continue building the left part of the "Z" shape:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 4 to build the center part of the "Z" shape:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 4)
   ```

4. Drop a b31 block at slot 7 to continue building the right part of the "Z" shape:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 7)
   ```

5. Drop a b11 block at slot 10 to complete the right part of the "Z" shape:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 10)
   ```

After following these steps, the structure will look like the character "Z" and will meet the stability constraint as well as the no boundary intrusion constraint, as the blocks are placed within the map's width boundaries.

Note: The exact positions of the blocks may vary depending on the specific implementation of the `ab_drop()` function, so adjustments may be needed based on the output of the function.
