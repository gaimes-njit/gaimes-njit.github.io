This is an open-ended task where users are expected to apply the `ab_drop()` function to create a stable structure representing the letter "D". Since there are multiple valid solutions, users are encouraged to think creatively and strategically to achieve visually appealing structures while adhering to the given constraints.

As such, there is no specific correct answer or solution to provide here. Users should experiment with different combinations of block types (`b11`, `b31`, and `b13`) and positions (`x_position`) to construct their own stable structures for the letter "D".
