Here is one possible solution to create a stable structure representing the capital letter "N":

```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

This solution creates a stable "N" structure by strategically placing the blocks to ensure stability and minimize boundary intrusion.
