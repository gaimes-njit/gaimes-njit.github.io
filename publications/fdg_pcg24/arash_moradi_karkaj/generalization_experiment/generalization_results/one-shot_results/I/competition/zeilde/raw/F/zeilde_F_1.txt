Steps:
1. Drawing the letter "F" with asterisks:

```
*****
*
*
*****
*
*
*
```

2. Listing the asterisks and spaces in each row:

Row 1: 5 asterisks, 0 spaces
Row 2: 1 asterisk, 0 spaces
Row 3: 1 asterisk, 0 spaces
Row 4: 5 asterisks, 0 spaces
Row 5: 1 asterisk, 0 spaces
Row 6: 1 asterisk, 0 spaces
Row 7: 1 asterisk, 0 spaces

3. Replacing asterisks with "x" and spaces with "y":

Row 1: xxxxx
Row 2: x
Row 3: x
Row 4: xxxxx
Row 5: x
Row 6: x
Row 7: x

4. Writing out each "x" and "y" side-by-side:

Row 1: x
Row 2: x
Row 3: x
Row 4: x
Row 5: x
Row 6: x
Row 7: x

5. Indicating the position of each variable:

Row 1: x-1
Row 2: x-1
Row 3: x-1
Row 4: x-1
Row 5: x-1
Row 6: x-1
Row 7: x-1

6. Returning a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
```
