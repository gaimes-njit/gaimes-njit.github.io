1. Drawing the letter "K" with asterisks:
```
*     *
*   *
* *
*   *
*     *
```

2. Listing the asterisks and spaces generated in each row:
```
Row 1: 1 asterisk, 5 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 2: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 3: 1 asterisk, 1 space, 1 asterisk
Row 4: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 5: 1 asterisk, 5 spaces, 1 asterisk
```

3. Listing the asterisks as "x" and spaces as "y" in each row:
```
Row 1: 1x, 5y, 1x
Row 2: 1x, 3y, 1x
Row 3: 1x, 1y, 1x
Row 4: 1x, 3y, 1x
Row 5: 1x, 5y, 1x
```

4. Writing out each "x" and "y" side-by-side for each row:
```
Row 1: xyyyyyx
Row 2: xyyx
Row 3: xyx
Row 4: xyyx
Row 5: xyyyyyx
```

5. Indicating the position of each variable for each row:
```
Row 1: x-1; y-2, y-3, y-4, y-5, y-6; x-7
Row 2: x-1; y-2, y-3; x-4
Row 3: x-1; y-2; x-3
Row 4: x-1; y-2, y-3; x-4
Row 5: x-1; y-2, y-3, y-4, y-5, y-6; x-7
```

6. Returning a sequence of "ab_drop" function calls for each row:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
