To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block, a b31 block, at the center slot of the base layer (layer 0) by calling `ab_drop('b31', 9)`. This block will serve as the base of the "A" structure and provide stability for the upper parts.

3. Drop the second block, a b13 block, at the slot to the left of the center slot on the layer above the base layer (layer 1) by calling `ab_drop('b13', 8)`. This block will form the left side of the "A" structure.

4. Drop the third block, a b13 block, at the slot to the right of the center slot on the layer above the base layer (layer 1) by calling `ab_drop('b13', 10)`. This block will form the right side of the "A" structure.

5. Drop the fourth block, a b11 block, at the center slot on the layer above the base layer (layer 1) by calling `ab_drop('b11', 9)`. This block will form the connecting part between the two sides of the "A" structure.

6. Now, the structure should resemble the uppercase letter "A". To ensure stability, we need to perform stability checks and adjust the placement of blocks if necessary.

7. Check the stability of the current structure. If it is stable, proceed to the next step. If not, adjust the placement of the blocks to ensure stability. You can do this by moving the blocks horizontally or vertically within their respective layers.

8. Once the stability is ensured, repeat steps 3-7 to generate more structures that resemble the uppercase letter "A". To add diversity, you can experiment with different placements of the blocks while maintaining stability.

Here is an example of the code to generate a stable "A" structure:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Drop the base block (b31) at the center slot of the base layer
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Step 3: Drop the left side block (b13) to the left of the center slot on the layer above the base layer
ab_drop('b13', 8)

# Step 4: Drop the right side block (b13) to the right of the center slot on the layer above the base layer
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Step 5: Drop the middle block (b11) at the center slot on the layer above the base layer
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Step 6: Perform stability checks and adjust block placements if necessary

# Step 7: Repeat steps 3-6 to generate more structures
```

Note: The provided code is just an example to demonstrate the process. You may need to modify and extend it to handle stability checks, adjust block placements, and generate diverse structures.
