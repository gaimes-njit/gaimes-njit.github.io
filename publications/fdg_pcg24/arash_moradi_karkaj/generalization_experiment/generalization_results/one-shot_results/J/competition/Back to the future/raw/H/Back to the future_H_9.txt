To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "H", we will utilize the `ab_drop()` function and follow the rules and constraints mentioned above. Here is a step-by-step approach to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Start by dropping the vertical b13 block in the center slot of the bottom layer to form the first vertical section of the "H". Use `ab_drop('b13', 9)` to drop the block at the coordinate (15, 9).

3. Drop two horizontal b31 blocks above the first vertical section to form the upper and lower horizontal sections of the "H". Use `ab_drop('b31', 7)` to drop the block at the coordinate (12, 7), and then use `ab_drop('b31', 7)` again to drop the block at the coordinate (9, 7).

4. Drop two vertical b13 blocks next to the upper and lower horizontal sections to complete the vertical sections of the "H". Use `ab_drop('b13', 12)` to drop the block at the coordinate (6, 12), and then use `ab_drop('b13', 12)` again to drop the block at the coordinate (3, 12).

5. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure it remains stable and does not collapse. This can be done by checking if the block being dropped is supported by the previously dropped blocks or the base. If necessary, adjust the position or order of the blocks being dropped to maintain stability.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 for multiple iterations, generating different configurations of the "H" structure while ensuring stability and diversity.

Here is an example of a function that generates the "H" structure using the `ab_drop()` function:

```python
def generate_H_structure():
    structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]  # Initialize the structure as an empty grid

    # Drop the first vertical section of the "H"
    ab_drop('b13', 9)

    # Drop the upper and lower horizontal sections of the "H"
    ab_drop('b31', 7)
    ab_drop('b31', 7)

    # Drop the remaining vertical sections of the "H"
    ab_drop('b13', 12)
    ab_drop('b13', 12)

    return structure
```

Note: This is just an example implementation. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints. Use the provided guidelines and constraints to adapt the function to meet the desired goals.
