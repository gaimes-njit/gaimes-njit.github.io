To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "I" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided `Map Initialization` code.
2. Begin by dropping the b31 block in the center of the structure at slot 9 using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`. This will make sure the block is dropped at the bottom layer (layer 0) and is centered.
3. Next, drop the b13 block just above the b31 block. Since the b13 block has a height of 3 units, we can drop it at slot 9 to align it with the center of the b31 block. Use `ab_drop('b13', 9)` to drop the block.
4. To complete the "I" shape, drop three b11 blocks above the b13 block. These blocks will form the vertical line of the uppercase "I". Drop the first b11 block at slot 9, the second block at slot 8, and the third block at slot 10.
5. Finally, ensure stability by checking if the structure is stable after each drop. You can do this by keeping track of the coordinates of each drop and checking if the blocks below provide stable support.

The resulting structure should resemble the uppercase character "I" and meet all the hard constraints.
