To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "O" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` variable provided:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block in the center of the bottom layer for stability:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

3. Drop a b13 block to the left of the b31 block for stability and shape similarity:
```python
ab_drop('b13', (W//2)-1)
```

4. Drop a b13 block to the right of the b31 block for stability and shape similarity:
```python
ab_drop('b13', (W//2)+1)
```

5. Drop a b31 block on top of the b13 blocks for stability:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the remaining layers, gradually moving upwards:
```python
for layer in range(2, H-1):
    ab_drop('b13', (W//2)-1)
    ab_drop('b13', (W//2)+1)
    ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

7. Finally, drop a b31 block on the top layer to complete the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

This sequence of block drops ensures stability by gradually building up the structure from bottom to top, providing support for each layer. By dropping alternating b13 and b31 blocks, the structure resembles the shape of the uppercase letter "O". The final structure will meet all the hard constraints and closely resemble the target shape.
