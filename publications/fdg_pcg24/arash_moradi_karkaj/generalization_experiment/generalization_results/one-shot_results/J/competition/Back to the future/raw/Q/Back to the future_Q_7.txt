To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Q" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in a strategy that involves dropping blocks in a specific order and position. This strategy ensures stability and follows the block-stacking problem techniques.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the `structure` variable provided.

2. Drop the b31 horizontally oriented block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and centered at slot 9 using the `ab_drop('b31', 9)` function. This provides a stable base for the structure.

3. Drop the b13 vertically oriented block above the b31 block at layer 2 and centered at slot 8 using the `ab_drop('b13', 8)` function. This forms the curved part of the "Q".

4. Drop a sequence of b11 blocks above the b13 block at layers 3 to 6, centered at slot 8 using the `ab_drop('b11', 8)` function. Each block will be stacked on top of the previous one, forming the stem of the "Q".

5. Drop the b31 horizontally oriented block above the b13 block at layer 7 and centered at slot 9 using the `ab_drop('b31', 9)` function. This forms the top part of the "Q" structure.

6. Drop a sequence of b11 blocks above the b31 block at layers 8 to 14, centered at slot 9 using the `ab_drop('b11', 9)` function. Each block will be stacked on top of the previous one, forming the loop of the "Q".

7. Drop the b13 vertically oriented block above the b31 block at layer 15 and centered at slot 8 using the `ab_drop('b13', 8)` function. This completes the "Q" structure.

Ensure to check stability before each call to the `ab_drop()` function to avoid structural collapse. The final generated structure will resemble the uppercase letter "Q" and meet all the hard constraints.

Note: The coordinates provided in step 2 to 7 are based on the assumption that the slot arrangement is 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19. If the slot arrangement is different, adjust the coordinates accordingly.

The implementation of this strategy is as follows:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the b31 block at the bottom layer and centered at slot 9
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the b13 block above the b31 block at layer 2 and centered at slot 8
ab_drop('b13', 8)

# Drop a sequence of b11 blocks above the b13 block at layers 3 to 6, centered at slot 8
for layer in range(3, 7):
    ab_drop('b11', 8)

# Drop the b31 block above the b13 block at layer 7 and centered at slot 9
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop a sequence of b11 blocks above the b31 block at layers 8 to 14, centered at slot 9
for layer in range(8, 15):
    ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the b13 block above the b31 block at layer 15 and centered at slot 8
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

This strategy ensures stability and meets the hard constraints while generating a structure that resembles the uppercase letter "Q".
