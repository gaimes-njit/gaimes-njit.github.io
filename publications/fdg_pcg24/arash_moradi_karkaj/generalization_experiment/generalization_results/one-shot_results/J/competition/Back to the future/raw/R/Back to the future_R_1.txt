To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "R" and meets all the hard constraints, follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid: 
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the b31 block on the bottom layer to form the vertical line of the "R" shape: 
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Next, drop the b13 block to form the baseline of the "R" shape, providing support for the vertical line:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Drop another b31 block at a higher layer to form the top horizontal line of the "R" shape, with one end supported by the vertical line:
```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

5. Drop two b11 blocks on top of the vertical line to complete the upper part of the "R" shape:
```
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

6. Add support for the top horizontal line by dropping a b13 block at a higher layer:
```
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

7. Finally, drop a b31 block at the same height as the top horizontal line to complete the diagonal line of the "R" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

Make sure to perform stability checks before each call to `ab_drop()` to ensure that the structure remains stable. Also, remember to update the `structure` grid after each block is dropped.

The above steps generate an example solution for creating the uppercase "R" shape, and you can explore different variations by adjusting the drop positions and order of block placement.
