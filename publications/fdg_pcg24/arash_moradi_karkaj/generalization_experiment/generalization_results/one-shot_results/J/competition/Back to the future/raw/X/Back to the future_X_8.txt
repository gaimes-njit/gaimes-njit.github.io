To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "X", we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Place the first b31 block in the bottom layer by calling the ab_drop() function:
ab_drop('b31', 10)

Step 3: Place the second b31 block in the layer above the first block, at a slot that provides stable support:
ab_drop('b31', 9)

Step 4: Place the b13 block above the two b31 blocks, centered between them:
ab_drop('b13', 10)

Step 5: Place the third b31 block in the layer above the b13 block, at a slot that provides stable support:
ab_drop('b31', 10)

Step 6: Place the fourth b31 block in the layer above the third block, at a slot that provides stable support:
ab_drop('b31', 11)

Step 7: Place the b13 block above the two b31 blocks, centered between them:
ab_drop('b13', 10)

Step 8: Place the fifth b31 block in the layer above the b13 block, at a slot that provides stable support:
ab_drop('b31', 10)

Step 9: Place the last b31 block in the layer above the fifth block, at a slot that provides stable support:
ab_drop('b31', 9)

The final structure should resemble the uppercase character "X" and meet all the hard constraints.
