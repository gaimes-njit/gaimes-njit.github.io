The code to generate a stable structure resembling the capital English letter "U" using the `ab_drop()` function is as follows:

ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)

Explanation:
The 'U' structure can be created by dropping blocks in a specific order. Following the constraints and the shape of the letter, we start by dropping two vertical blocks 'b13' at positions 4 and 5. Then, we drop a horizontal block 'b31' at position 5 and another 'b31' at position 6. Finally, we drop two more vertical blocks 'b13' at positions 6 and 7, and end with a vertical block 'b31' at position 7.

This series of ab_drop() function calls will result in a stable structure resembling the capital letter "U" on the grid.
