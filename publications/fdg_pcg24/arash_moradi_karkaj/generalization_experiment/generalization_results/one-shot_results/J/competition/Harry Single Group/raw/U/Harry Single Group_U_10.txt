To form a shape resembling the letter "U" using the available props and the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully plan the placement of the bricks to ensure stability and avoid boundary collisions. Here's a step-by-step guide to generating the structure:

1. Initialize the field: The field is a 20x16 grid with 320 cells. We can represent it as a 2D list with the first index representing the x-axis and the second index representing the y-axis. Start by setting all cells to 0 to indicate they are unoccupied.

```python
field = [[0] * 16 for _ in range(20)]
```

2. Place the first vertical brick (b13): Since the letter "U" has a curved bottom, we can start by placing a vertical brick at the bottom-left corner of the field. Use the ab_drop() function to generate and drop the b13 brick starting from x_position 0.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

After executing this, the cells (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2) will be occupied.

3. Place the second vertical brick (b13): To form the sides of the letter "U", we need to place two vertical bricks next to each other. Use the ab_drop() function again, this time with x_position 2.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

This will occupy the cells (2, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 2).

4. Place the horizontal brick (b31): Lastly, we need to connect the sides of the letter "U" with a horizontal brick at the top. Use the ab_drop() function with x_position 0 to generate and drop the b31 brick.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

This will occupy the cells (0, 3), (1, 3), and (2, 3).

By following these steps, we have successfully generated the shape resembling the letter "U". Remember to execute the ab_drop() function calls in the correct order to avoid stability issues and boundary collisions.
