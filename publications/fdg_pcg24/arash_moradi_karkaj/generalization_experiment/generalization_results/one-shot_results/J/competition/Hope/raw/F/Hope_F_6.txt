To create the structure of the letter "F" inside a 20x16 box block, you can use the following ab_drop commands:

ab_drop('b31', 0)    # Tall vertical line of the "F"
ab_drop('b31', 4)    # Horizontal line of the "F"
ab_drop('b31', 8)    # Short vertical line of the "F"

Please note that the x positions used here (0, 4, and 8) are just examples, and you can adjust them according to your desired positioning within the 20x16 box block.
