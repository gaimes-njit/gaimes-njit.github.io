To create an "L" shape inside a 20x16 box using ab_drop('blocktype', x position), we need to strategically place the blocks in the correct positions. Here's how you can do it:

1. Start by placing a b13 block at position (0, 12). This will create the vertical part of the "L" shape.
Command: ab_drop('b13', 0)

2. Next, place a b13 block at position (3, 12). This will extend the vertical part of the "L" shape.
Command: ab_drop('b13', 3)

3. Now, place a b31 block at position (3, 9). This will create the horizontal part of the "L" shape, connecting it to the vertical part.
Command: ab_drop('b31', 3)

4. Finally, place a b11 block at position (0, 9). This will serve as the corner block of the "L" shape.
Command: ab_drop('b11', 0)

The structure should now resemble the letter "L" inside the 20x16 box.
