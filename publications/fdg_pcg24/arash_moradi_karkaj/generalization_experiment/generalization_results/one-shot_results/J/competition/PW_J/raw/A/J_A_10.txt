To generate the uppercase letter "A", we can use the following stream of commands:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the commands:

1. Use `ab_drop('b13', 1)` to place a vertical straight block at position 1.
2. Use `ab_drop('b31', 1)` to place a horizontal straight block at position 1, just below the vertical block.
3. Use `ab_drop('b13', 2)` to place another vertical straight block at position 2, next to the horizontal block.
4. Use `ab_drop('b11', 1)` to place a square block at position 1, below the first vertical block.
5. Use `ab_drop('b11', 3)` to place another square block at position 3, to complete the letter "A" shape.

By following these commands, the blocks will be stacked on top of each other to form the letter "A" within the defined grid boundaries.
