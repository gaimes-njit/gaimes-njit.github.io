To create the uppercase English letter "A", we will need to use a combination of the block types provided. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "A":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "A" in the defined environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
