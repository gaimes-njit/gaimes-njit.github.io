To generate the uppercase letter "A" using the given block types and gravity rules, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b31 block at position 1 to create the horizontal line at the top of the "A":
   ab_drop('b31', 1)

2. Place a b13 block at position 2 to create the left vertical line of the "A":
   ab_drop('b13', 2)

3. Place a b31 block at position 3 to create the central horizontal line of the "A":
   ab_drop('b31', 3)

4. Place a b13 block at position 4 to create the right vertical line of the "A":
   ab_drop('b13', 4)

5. Place a b11 block at position 2 to fill the gap in the middle of the "A":
   ab_drop('b11', 2)

Here is the complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "A":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively in the given order to accurately construct the letter "A" within the allowed space boundaries.
