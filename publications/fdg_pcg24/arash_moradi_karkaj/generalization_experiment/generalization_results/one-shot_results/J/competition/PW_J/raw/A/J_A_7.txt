To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "A" in the grid environment, following the stacking and stability rules.
