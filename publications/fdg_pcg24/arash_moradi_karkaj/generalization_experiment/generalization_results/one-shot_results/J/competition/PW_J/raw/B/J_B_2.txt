To create the uppercase letter "B", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place another horizontal straight block next to it
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block on top of the second horizontal block
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a square block below the vertical block
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place another square block next to it
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place another square block next to it
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place another horizontal straight block next to the square blocks
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the vertical straight block on top of the horizontal block
```
