To generate the uppercase letter "B", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',1)   # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place another square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)   # Place another square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place another vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',4)   # Place another vertical straight block at position 4
```

By following these commands, the blocks will stack up and form the uppercase letter "B".
