To generate the uppercase letter "C" using the given block types and environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`. This will act as the top part of the letter "C".

2. Next, drop a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`. This will act as the vertical part of the letter "C".

3. To complete the letter "C", we need to add a horizontal straight block (`b31`) below the vertical part. Drop it at position 3: `ab_drop('b31', 3)`.

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "C" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```
