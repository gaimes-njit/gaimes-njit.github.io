To generate the letter "C" using the specified block types and gravity rules, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the first block (b31) horizontally at position 1:
ab_drop('b31',1)

Step 2: Place the second block (b13) vertically at position 2:
ab_drop('b13',2)

Step 3: Place the third block (b13) vertically at position 3:
ab_drop('b13',3)

Step 4: Place the fourth block (b31) horizontally at position 4:
ab_drop('b31',4)

Step 5: Place the fifth block (b31) horizontally at position 4:
ab_drop('b31',4)

Step 6: Place the sixth block (b13) vertically at position 3:
ab_drop('b13',3)

Step 7: Place the seventh block (b13) vertically at position 2:
ab_drop('b13',2)

After following these steps, you should have successfully generated the uppercase English letter "C" within the specified boundaries and gravity rules.
