To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal block of width 3 (b31) starting at position 1.
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places a vertical block of height 3 (b13) starting at position 2.
3. The third command `ab_drop('b13', 4)` places another vertical block of height 3 (b13) starting at position 4.
4. The last command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places another horizontal block of width 3 (b31) starting at position 1.

When executed in the given environment, these commands will create the letter "C" with proper stacking and stability.
