To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
- Start by placing a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
- Then, place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2.
- Repeat this pattern two more times to complete the letter "C".

By following these commands, the blocks will stack and maintain stability according to the gravity rules, resulting in the uppercase letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries.
