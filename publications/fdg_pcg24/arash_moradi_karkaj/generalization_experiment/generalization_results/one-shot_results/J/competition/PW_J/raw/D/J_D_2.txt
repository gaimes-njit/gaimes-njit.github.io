To construct the uppercase letter "D" using the ab_drop() command and the given block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 3:

```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4:

```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

5. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 4:

```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

6. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4:

```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

7. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 5:

```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

8. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 6:

```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

9. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 6:

```
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

10. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 6:

```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

11. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 7:

```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

This sequence of ab_drop() commands will generate the uppercase letter "D" within the allowed space and adhere to the gravity rules.
