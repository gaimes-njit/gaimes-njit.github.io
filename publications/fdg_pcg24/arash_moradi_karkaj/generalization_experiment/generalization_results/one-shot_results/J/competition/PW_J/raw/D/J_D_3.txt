To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to form the top part of the letter "D".
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 to form the left part of the letter "D".
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to complete the left part of the letter "D".
4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to form the middle part of the letter "D".
5. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to form the bottom left part of the letter "D".
6. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 to form the bottom middle part of the letter "D".
7. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 to form the bottom right part of the letter "D".
8. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 to complete the letter "D".
