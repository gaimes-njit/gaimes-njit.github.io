To generate the uppercase letter "D," you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "D" in the Tetris-like environment, following the defined gravity rules and boundaries.
