To generate the uppercase English letter "D", you can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place square block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place vertical straight block at position 5
```

These commands will create the letter "D" when executed consecutively, ensuring that the blocks are stacked and stable within the allowed space.
