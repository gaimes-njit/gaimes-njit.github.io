To create the uppercase letter "E", we need to use the following ab_drop() commands:

First, we start by creating the vertical part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Next, we create the top horizontal part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Finally, we create the bottom horizontal part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

When all these commands are executed consecutively, the blocks will be stacked in a way that forms the letter "E" within the allowed space boundaries.
