To generate the uppercase letter "E" using the ab_drop() commands, you can follow the instructions below:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',2)  # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place the horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',3)  # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',4)  # Place the horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b11',4)  # Place the square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11',5)  # Place the square block at position 5
```

These commands will stack the blocks in the shape of the letter "E" within the allowed space of the grid. Ensure to follow the order of the commands to achieve the desired outcome.
