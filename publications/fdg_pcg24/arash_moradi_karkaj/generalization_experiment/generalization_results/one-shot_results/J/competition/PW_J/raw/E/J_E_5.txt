To generate the uppercase letter "E", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place the vertical straight block on the left side
ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Place a square block beneath the vertical block
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place another square block next to the previous block to form the horizontal line
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place another vertical block on the right side
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal block on top to complete the letter "E"
```

These commands will generate the uppercase letter "E" in the defined environment.
