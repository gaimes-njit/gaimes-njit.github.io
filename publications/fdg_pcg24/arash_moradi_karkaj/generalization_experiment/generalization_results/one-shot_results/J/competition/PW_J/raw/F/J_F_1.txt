To generate the uppercase letter "F" using the ab_drop() command and the block types in the defined environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. 
   `ab_drop('b31', 1)`

2. Next, drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, right next to the horizontal block.
   `ab_drop('b13', 2)`

3. To complete the top part of the letter "F," drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
   `ab_drop('b31', 1)`

4. Finally, drop a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 2, just below the vertical block.
   `ab_drop('b11', 2)`

The stream of commands to generate the letter "F" would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```
