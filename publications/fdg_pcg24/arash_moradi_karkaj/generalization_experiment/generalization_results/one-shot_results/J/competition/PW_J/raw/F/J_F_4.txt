To generate the uppercase letter "F", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Explanation:
- We start by dropping a horizontal block ('b31') at position 1 to form the top part of the letter F.
- Next, we drop a vertical block ('b13') at position 2 to form the vertical stroke of the letter F.
- After that, we drop two square blocks ('b11') at position 1 to form the horizontal stroke of the letter F.

These commands, when executed consecutively, will create the uppercase letter F within the given environment and gravity rules.
