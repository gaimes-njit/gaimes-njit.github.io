To construct the uppercase English letter "F", we can use the following sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

This sequence of commands will create a vertical line on the left side of the grid using one b31 block and three b11 blocks, and then connect it to the horizontal line using one b13 block. The end result will resemble the letter "F" when viewed in the grid.
