To create the capital letter "F," you need to stack the blocks in a specific order. Here are the ab_drop() commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Please note that these commands should be executed consecutively and follow the defined gravity rules.
