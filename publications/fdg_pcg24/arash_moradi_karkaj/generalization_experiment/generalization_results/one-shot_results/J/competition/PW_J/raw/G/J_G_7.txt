To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b11',1) # Place a 1x1 square block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1) # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',4) # Place a 1x1 square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',2) # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',4) # Place a vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11',2) # Place a 1x1 square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3) # Place a 1x1 square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',4) # Place a 1x1 square block at position 4
ab_drop('b13',4) # Place a vertical straight block at position 4
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "G" within the allowed space boundaries and following the gravity rules.
