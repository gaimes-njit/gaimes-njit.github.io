To generate the uppercase letter "G" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
3. Place a square block (b11) at position 2: `ab_drop('b11', 2)`
4. Place another square block (b11) at position 2: `ab_drop('b11', 2)`
5. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`

Here is the complete stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

By following these commands, you will generate the uppercase letter "G" with proper stacking and stability within the defined environment.
