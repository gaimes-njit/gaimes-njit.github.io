To generate the uppercase letter "H", the following sequence of ab_drop() commands can be used:

``` 
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "H" in the Tetris-like environment, while ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
