To create the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

Explanation:

1. The first command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 in the grid.
2. The second command places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 in the grid.
3. The third command places another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 in the grid.
4. The fourth command places a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 1 in the grid.
5. The fifth command places another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 in the grid.
6. The sixth command places another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 in the grid.

These commands, when executed consecutively, will form the letter "H" with the given block types and within the allowed space boundaries.
