To generate the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types and environment, the following stream of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Explanation of the commands:
- The first three `ab_drop('b31',x)` commands are used to create the two vertical bars of the letter "H" by stacking three horizontal blocks next to each other.
- The next two `ab_drop('b13',x)` commands are used to create the horizontal bar of the letter "H" by stacking two vertical blocks on top of each other.
- The last `ab_drop('b13',x)` command is used to complete the bottom part of the horizontal bar of the letter "H" by stacking another vertical block next to the existing ones.

By executing these commands sequentially, the uppercase letter "H" can be generated within the allowed space boundaries while adhering to the gravity rules.
