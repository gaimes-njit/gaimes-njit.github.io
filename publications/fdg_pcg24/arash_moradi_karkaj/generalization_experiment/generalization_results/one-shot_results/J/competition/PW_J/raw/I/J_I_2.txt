To create the uppercase letter "I", we can use the block types b11 and b13. The letter "I" has a height of 3 units and a width of 1 unit. Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "I":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

Explanation of commands:
- The first three commands place three vertical straight blocks (b13) at position 1 along the width, creating the vertical part of the letter "I".
- The fourth command places a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 1, completing the horizontal part of the letter "I".

By following these commands, the letter "I" will be accurately represented and fit within the allowed space boundaries.
