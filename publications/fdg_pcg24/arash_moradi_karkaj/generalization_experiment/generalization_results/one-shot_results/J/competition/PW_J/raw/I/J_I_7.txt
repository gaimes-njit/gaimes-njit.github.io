To create the uppercase letter "I" using the given block types and environment, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Then, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, adjacent to the first block.
3. Next, we place a third horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3, adjacent to the second block.
4. To complete the vertical stroke of the letter "I", we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, between the second and third blocks.
5. Finally, we place the last horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, adjacent to the first block, completing the horizontal stroke of the letter "I".

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "I" with stability in the defined environment.
