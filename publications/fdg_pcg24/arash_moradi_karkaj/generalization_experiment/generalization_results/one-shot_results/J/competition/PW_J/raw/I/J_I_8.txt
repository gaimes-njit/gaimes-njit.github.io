To create the capital letter "I," we can use a combination of the block types b31 (horizontal straight block) and b13 (vertical straight block). Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "I":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. Drop a horizontal block b31 at position 1.
2. Drop another horizontal block b31 at position 2.
3. Drop the last horizontal block b31 at position 3.
4. Finally, drop a vertical block b13 at position 2 to complete the shape of the letter "I".

This sequence of commands will create the capital letter "I" within the allowed space boundaries.
