To generate the uppercase English letter "K" using the given block types and environment, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the 1x1 square block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable "K" shape within the allowed space boundaries.
