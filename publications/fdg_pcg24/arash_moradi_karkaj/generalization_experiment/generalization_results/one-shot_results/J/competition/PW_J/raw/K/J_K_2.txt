To create the uppercase letter "K" using the given block types and the defined environment, we need to carefully stack and position the blocks in a way that resembles the letter "K".

Here is a stream of commands using ab_drop() to generate the letter "K":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Explanation:

1. The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1 on the grid, creating the left leg of the letter "K".

2. The second command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places a vertical straight block at position 2 on the grid, connecting to the top left corner of the previous block and forming the left side of the letter "K".

3. The third command `ab_drop('b13', 4)` places another vertical straight block at position 4 on the grid, creating the middle section of the letter "K".

4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 4)` places a horizontal straight block at position 4 on the grid, connecting to the bottom of the previous vertical block and forming the bottom part of the middle section of the letter "K".

5. The fifth command `ab_drop('b31', 5)` places another horizontal straight block at position 5 on the grid, extending the bottom part of the middle section of the letter "K" to the right.

6. The sixth command `ab_drop('b13', 5)` places a vertical straight block at position 5 on the grid, connecting to the top right corner of the previous block and completing the right side of the letter "K".

By following these commands in the given environment, you can create a stable and accurate representation of the uppercase letter "K".
