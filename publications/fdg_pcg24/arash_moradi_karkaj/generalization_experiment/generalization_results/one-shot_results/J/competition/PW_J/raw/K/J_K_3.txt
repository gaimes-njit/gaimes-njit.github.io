To generate the uppercase letter "K", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

These commands will place the blocks in such a way that they form the letter "K" within the allowed space boundaries.
