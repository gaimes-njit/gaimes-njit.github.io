To generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can use the following sequence of commands:

1. Place the upper-left vertical bar of the letter:
```py
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Place the horizontal bar of the letter, just below the vertical bar:
```py
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Place the lower-left vertical bar of the letter, just below the horizontal bar:
```py
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Place the diagonal bar of the letter, starting from the top-right corner of the vertical bar and extending to the bottom-left corner of the horizontal bar:
```py
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

The complete sequence of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "K" is as follows:

```py
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

Make sure to execute these commands consecutively, without any interruptions or variations in timing, to accurately construct the letter "K" within the allowed space boundaries.
