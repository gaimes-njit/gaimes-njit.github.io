To generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a 1x1 square block at position 1 to start the letter.
2. Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1 to form the top part of the letter.
3. Place another 1x1 square block at position 4 to create the diagonal line of the letter.
4. Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 2 to complete the letter.

This series of commands will generate the uppercase letter "K" using the specified block types and gravity rules.
