To create the letter "K", we need to place the blocks in the following order:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2.
3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 3.

Here are the command steps to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```
