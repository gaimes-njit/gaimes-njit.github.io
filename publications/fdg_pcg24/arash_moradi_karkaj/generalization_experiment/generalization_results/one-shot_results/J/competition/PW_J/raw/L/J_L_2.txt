To generate the uppercase letter "L" in the Tetris-like environment, we need to use the block types mentioned. Here is a stream of commands using the ab_drop() function to construct the letter "L":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

Explanation of the commands:
- The first command creates a horizontal straight block of width 3 units at position 1.
- The second command creates a vertical straight block of height 3 units at position 2.
- The third command creates another vertical straight block of height 3 units at position 3.
- The fourth command creates another vertical straight block of height 3 units at position 4.

When executed consecutively, these commands will generate the uppercase letter "L" within the defined environment, while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
