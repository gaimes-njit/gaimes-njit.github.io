To generate the uppercase letter "L", we can use the following sequence of commands:

``` 
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

Explanation:
1. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 along the width.
2. Place the vertical straight block (b13) at position 4 along the width.

This sequence of commands will construct the "L" shape with stability and within the allowed boundaries of the grid.
