To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1 along the width.
- The second command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 1 along the width, right below the previous block.
- The third command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places another vertical straight block of height 3 at position 2 along the width, creating the shape of the letter "L".

By executing these commands consecutively, the blocks will stack on top of each other and form the letter "L" in the defined environment.
