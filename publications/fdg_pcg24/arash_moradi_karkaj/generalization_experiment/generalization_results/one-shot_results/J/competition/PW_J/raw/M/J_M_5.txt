To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can start by placing two vertical straight blocks side by side to form the two outer edges of the letter. Then, we can place a horizontal straight block between the two vertical blocks to form the middle part of the letter.

The following stream of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "M":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid ways to generate the letter "M" using the given block types in the defined environment.
