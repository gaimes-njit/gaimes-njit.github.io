To generate the uppercase letter "M", we need to strategically place the block types in the defined environment. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands that will form the letter "M":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b31',5)
ab_drop('b11',7)
ab_drop('b11',6)
ab_drop('b11',8)
```

By following these commands, the blocks will be placed in a way that resembles the letter "M" while maintaining structural stability according to the gravity rules.
