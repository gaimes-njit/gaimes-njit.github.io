To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to form the left side of the letter "M".
2. The second command places a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 2 to form the middle top part of the letter "M".
3. The third command places a horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 2 to form the middle bottom part of the letter "M".
4. The fourth command places another 1x1 square block (b11) at position 5 to form the right side top part of the letter "M".
5. The fifth command places another vertical straight block (b13) starting from position 6 to form the right side bottom part of the letter "M".
