To generate the uppercase English letter "N", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

This sequence of commands creates the letter "N" by stacking the block types in the defined environment, adhering to the gravity rules. Note that the blocks are placed one by one, starting from position 1.
