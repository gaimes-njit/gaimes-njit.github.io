To create the capital letter "N", we need to stack and arrange the block types in a specific way. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "N":

```
ab_drop('b31',1) 
ab_drop('b13',2) 
ab_drop('b31',4) 
ab_drop('b31',7) 
ab_drop('b31',10) 
ab_drop('b13',13) 
ab_drop('b31',15) 
ab_drop('b31',17) 
```

By following these commands, you will create a letter "N" in the Tetris-like environment.
