To generate the uppercase letter "N" using the ab_drop() command and block types in the defined environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a horizontal straight block of type b31 at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`.
2. Drop a vertical straight block of type b13 at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`.
3. Drop a horizontal straight block of type b31 at position 3: `ab_drop('b31', 3)`.
4. Drop a vertical straight block of type b13 at position 4: `ab_drop('b13', 4)`.

The above commands will create the uppercase letter "N" within the allowed space and follow the gravity rules.
