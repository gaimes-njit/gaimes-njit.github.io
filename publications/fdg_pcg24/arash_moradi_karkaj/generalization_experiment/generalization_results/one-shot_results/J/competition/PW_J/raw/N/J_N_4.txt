To generate the uppercase letter "N" using the provided block types in the defined environment, you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "N" by stacking and arranging the blocks according to the gravity rules.
