To generate the uppercase letter "N", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Explanation:

1. The first command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` creates the left vertical line of the letter "N".
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` extends the left vertical line downwards.
3. The third command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` creates the horizontal line of the letter "N".
4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b13', 4)` creates the right vertical line of the letter "N".
5. The fifth command `ab_drop('b13', 5)` extends the right vertical line downwards to complete the letter "N".

By following these commands, the uppercase letter "N" will be generated in the specified environment while ensuring stability and adherence to the gravity rules.
