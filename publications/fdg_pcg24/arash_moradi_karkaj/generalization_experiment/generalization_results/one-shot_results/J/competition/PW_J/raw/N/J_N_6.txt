To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 5
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "N" within the allowed space and maintain structural stability according to the gravity rules.
