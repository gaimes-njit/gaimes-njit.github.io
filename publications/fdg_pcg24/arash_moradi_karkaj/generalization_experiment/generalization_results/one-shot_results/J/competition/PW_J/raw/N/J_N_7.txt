To create the letter "N", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 13)
ab_drop('b11', 14)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```

This sequence of commands will place each block in the correct position to form the letter "N" within the allowed space boundaries and following the gravity rules.
