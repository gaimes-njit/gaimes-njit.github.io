To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in a way that forms the letter "N" within the allowed space and follows the gravity rules.
