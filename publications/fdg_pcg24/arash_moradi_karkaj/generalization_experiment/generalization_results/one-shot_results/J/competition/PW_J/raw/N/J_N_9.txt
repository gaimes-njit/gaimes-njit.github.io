To create the uppercase letter "N" in the specified environment, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

This sequence will place the blocks in such a way that they resemble the letter "N" when viewed in the grid. Note that each command represents placing a block of the specified type at the given position along the width. The numbers inside the parentheses represent the block type ('b31' or 'b13') and the position along the width (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8).
