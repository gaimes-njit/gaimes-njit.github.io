To generate the uppercase English letter "O" using the given command and block types, you can follow the steps below:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 using the command `ab_drop('b31', 1)`.
2. Next, place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 4 by using the command `ab_drop('b13', 4)`. This will create the left-hand side of the letter "O".
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create the right-hand side of the letter "O".

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "O" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the required positions to form the uppercase letter "O" within the allowed space boundaries.
