To generate the uppercase letter "O", we can use a combination of the block types b31 and b13. Here is the stream of commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
ab_drop('b13', 16)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "O" by stacking the blocks horizontally and vertically in the defined environment.
