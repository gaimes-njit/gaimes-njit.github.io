To generate the uppercase English letter "O", the following stream of ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

The above commands will place the blocks in a sequential manner, creating the shape of the letter "O" within the allowed space boundaries.
