To generate the uppercase English letter "O", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. This forms the top of the letter "O".
2. The second command places a vertical straight block (b13) right below the previous block at position 1. This forms the left side of the letter "O".
3. The third command places another vertical straight block (b13) at position 4. This forms the right side of the letter "O".
4. The fourth command places another horizontal straight block (b31) right below the previous block at position 4. This completes the letter "O".

The final arrangement of blocks will resemble the uppercase letter "O" while ensuring structural stability under the gravity rules.
