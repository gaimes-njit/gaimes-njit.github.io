To construct the letter "Q" using the given block types and commands, we can follow the steps below:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, aligned with the bottom of the first block:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 3, aligned with the bottom of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4, aligned with the bottom of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

5. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 5, aligned with the right side of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b31',5)
```

6. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 19, aligned with the right side of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13',19)
```

7. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 18, aligned with the bottom of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b31',18)
```

8. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 18, aligned with the bottom of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13',18)
```

9. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 17, aligned with the bottom of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b31',17)
```

10. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 17, aligned with the bottom of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13',17)
```

11. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 16, aligned with the bottom of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b31',16)
```

12. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 16, aligned with the bottom of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13',16)
```

13. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 15, aligned with the bottom of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b31',15)
```

14. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, aligned with the bottom of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

15. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, aligned with the bottom of the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

The stream of commands mentioned above will generate the letter "Q" in the given Tetris-like environment and 2D gravity rules.
