To create the capital letter "R", we can use the following set of commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```

Explanation:

1. Place a 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 1 to start the vertical line of the letter.
2. Place another 1x1 square block ('b11') next to the first one at position 2.
3. Place a third 1x1 square block ('b11') next to the second one at position 3.
4. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 4 to form the top portion of the letter.
5. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 to create the vertical line of the letter.
6. Place another 1x1 square block ('b11') next to the vertical straight block at position 5.
7. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') next to the last block at position 2 to connect the two vertical lines.
8. Place another 1x1 square block ('b11') next to the last block at position 6 to complete the top right portion of the letter.
9. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') next to the last block at position 3 to complete the vertical line.
10. Place another 1x1 square block ('b11') next to the last block at position 7 to complete the bottom right portion of the letter.

By following these commands, the final result will resemble the uppercase letter "R" within the defined environment.
