To generate the uppercase English letter "R," we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place square block at position 5
```

These commands will create the uppercase letter "R" within the defined environment, maintaining stacking and stability with the gravity rules.
