To create the uppercase letter "R", we can start off by using the b13 block (vertical straight block) to create the vertical line on the left side of the letter. We can then use the b31 block (horizontal straight block) to create the top and bottom lines of the letter. Finally, we can use the b11 block (1x1 square block) to fill in the gap in the middle of the letter.

Here are the ab_drop() commands to generate the uppercase letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Make sure to execute each command one after the other, starting from the X position of 1.
