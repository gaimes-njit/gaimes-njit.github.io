Task: Construct the uppercase English letter "T" using the ab_drop() command and the given Block Types in the defined environment.

To construct the letter "T", we can use a combination of block types b31 and b13. Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "T":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 along the width, creating the top part of the letter "T".
2. The second command places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 along the width, connecting to the bottom part of the letter "T".
3. The third command repeats the placement of a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to complete the middle part of the letter "T".

This stream of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "T" within the defined boundary and maintaining stability according to the given gravity rules.
