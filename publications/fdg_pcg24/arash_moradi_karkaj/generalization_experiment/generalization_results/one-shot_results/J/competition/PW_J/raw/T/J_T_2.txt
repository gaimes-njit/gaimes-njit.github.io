To create the uppercase letter "T", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

Here's a breakdown of the placement for each command:

1. The first command `ab_drop('b31',1)` places a horizontal block of width 3 at position 1. This creates the top part of the "T".
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13',2)` places a vertical block of height 3 at position 2. This creates the vertical stem of the "T".
3. The third command `ab_drop('b31',2)` places another horizontal block of width 3 at position 2, slightly below the first command. This completes the bottom part of the "T" and provides stability to the structure.

When these commands are executed in order, they will create a stable uppercase letter "T" within the specified boundaries.
