To generate the uppercase letter "T", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Top dot of the "T"
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Horizontal bar of the "T"
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Vertical bar of the "T"
```

These commands will place the blocks in the grid in the proper positions to form the letter "T", starting from position 1 and following the gravity rules.
