To generate uppercase English letter "T", we can use the following commands:

```python
ab_drop('b11',1) # Place a 1x1 square block at position (1, 1)
ab_drop('b31',2) # Place a horizontal straight block at position (2, 1)
ab_drop('b11',2) # Place a 1x1 square block at position (2, 2)
ab_drop('b11',3) # Place a 1x1 square block at position (3, 1)
```

By executing these commands consecutively, we will be able to construct the uppercase letter "T" within the specified boundaries and gravity rules.
