To generate the uppercase English letter "T", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Let's break down the commands:

1. `ab_drop('b31', 1)`: This command places a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1. This creates the top bar of the "T".
2. `ab_drop('b13', 2)`: This command places a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 2. This creates the vertical bar of the "T".
3. `ab_drop('b31', 2)`: This command places another horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 2. This adds stability to the vertical bar of the "T".
4. `ab_drop('b11', 2)`: This command places a square block at position 2. This completes the top of the vertical bar and adds stability to the overall shape of the "T".

By executing these commands in order, we will generate the uppercase English letter "T" within the defined constraints and gravity rules of the environment.
