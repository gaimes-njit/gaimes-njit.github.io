To create the uppercase letter "U" in the given environment, we can use the ab_drop() commands as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "U" by stacking the block types in the correct positions.
