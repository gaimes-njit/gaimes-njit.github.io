To generate the uppercase letter "U", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 to create the left side of the "U".
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 to create the right side of the "U".
4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 6 to complete the top of the "U".

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "U" using the given block types and within the specified boundaries.
