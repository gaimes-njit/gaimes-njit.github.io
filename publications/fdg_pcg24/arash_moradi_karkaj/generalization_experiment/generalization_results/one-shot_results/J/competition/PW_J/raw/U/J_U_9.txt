To generate the uppercase English letter "U", we can use the following stream of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place vertical straight block at position 7
```

These commands will construct the uppercase letter "U" by stacking the block types in the specified positions while adhering to the gravity rules.
