To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)      # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)      # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 4)      # Place another horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)      # Place another vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 7)      # Place another horizontal straight block at position 7
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries while adhering to the gravity rules.
