To generate the uppercase English letter "V", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b31',8)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to start forming the left side of the "V".
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4 to form the bottom left corner of the "V".
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 to complete the left side of the "V".
4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 8 to form the right side of the "V".

These commands will construct a stable and accurate representation of the uppercase English letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries.
