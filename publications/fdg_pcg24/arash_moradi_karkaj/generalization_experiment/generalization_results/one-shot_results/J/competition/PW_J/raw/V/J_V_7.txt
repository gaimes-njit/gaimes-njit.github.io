To generate the uppercase letter "V", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence places a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1, followed by a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2, and then another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3. When executed in order, these commands will create a stable and accurately represented uppercase letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries.
