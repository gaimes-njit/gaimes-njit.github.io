To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we can use the following series of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',6)
ab_drop('b13',7)
```

This sequence of commands will create a letter "V" using the block types and following the gravity rules in the defined environment.
