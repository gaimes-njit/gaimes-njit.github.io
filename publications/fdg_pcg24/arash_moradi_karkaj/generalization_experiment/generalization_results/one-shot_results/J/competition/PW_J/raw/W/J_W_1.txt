To generate the uppercase letter "W", we can break it down into three blocks: two inclined lines and one straight line in the middle. Here's how we can achieve it:

1. Place the first inclined line using horizontal straight blocks (b31) at positions 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Place the second inclined line using vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 3 and 4:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

3. Place the straight line in the middle using horizontal straight blocks (b31) at positions 5, 6, and 7:
```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

By following these commands, you will generate the uppercase letter "W" in the specified environment.
