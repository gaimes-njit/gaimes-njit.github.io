To generate the uppercase letter "W", we can use a combination of the block types mentioned. We will start by placing a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1. Then, we will place two vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 2 and 4. Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
