To generate the uppercase letter "W", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b31', 1)        # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)        # Place another horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 3)        # Place the vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)        # Place another vertical block at position 2

This sequence of commands will create a stable arrangement of blocks that resembles the letter "W" within the defined environment.
