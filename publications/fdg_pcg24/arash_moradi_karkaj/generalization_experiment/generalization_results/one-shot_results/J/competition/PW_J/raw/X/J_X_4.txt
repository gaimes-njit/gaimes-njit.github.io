To generate the uppercase English letter "X", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
```

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the commands:

- Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
- Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2.
- Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 4.
- Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 5.

This will create the letter "X" within the defined boundaries and gravity rules.
