To generate the uppercase letter "Y", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31',1)           # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)           # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)           # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',2)           # Place the second square block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',2)           # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
```

By following these commands in order, the blocks will stack and form the uppercase letter "Y" within the allowed space boundaries.
