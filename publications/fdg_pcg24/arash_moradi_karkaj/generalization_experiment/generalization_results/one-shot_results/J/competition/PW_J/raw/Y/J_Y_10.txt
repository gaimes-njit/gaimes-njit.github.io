To generate the uppercase letter "Y" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the horizontal block at the top-left corner of the grid, starting at position 1. This will form the diagonal line of the letter "Y". Use the command ab_drop('b31', 1) to place the block.

2. Place the vertical block on top of the horizontal block, starting at position 2. This will form the left side of the letter "Y". Use the command ab_drop('b13', 2) to place the block.

3. Finally, place two square blocks horizontally adjacent to the vertical block, starting at positions 2 and 3. This will form the right side of the letter "Y". Use the command ab_drop('b11', 2) followed by ab_drop('b11', 3) to place the blocks.

The complete sequence of commands to generate the uppercase letter "Y" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```
