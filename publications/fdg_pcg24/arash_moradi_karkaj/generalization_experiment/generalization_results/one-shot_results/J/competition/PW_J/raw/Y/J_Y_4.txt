To generate the uppercase letter "Y" using the given block types and Tetris-like environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by dropping a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 to form the left arm of the "Y".
2. Drop a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3 to connect the left arm with the stem of the "Y".
3. Drop a 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 2 to form the top of the stem.
4. Drop another 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 3 to extend the height of the stem.
5. Drop a third 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 4 to complete the stem.
6. Finally, drop another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2 to form the right arm of the "Y".

These commands will create a stable and accurate representation of the uppercase letter "Y" within the allowed space boundaries.
