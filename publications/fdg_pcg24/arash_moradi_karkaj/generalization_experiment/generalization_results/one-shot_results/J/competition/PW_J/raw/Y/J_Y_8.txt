To create the uppercase English letter "Y", we will start by using the `b31` block type to create the vertical stroke of the letter. Then, we will use the `b13` block type to create the slanting strokes of the letter. Here is the sequence of `ab_drop()` commands to generate the letter "Y":

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first block of the vertical stroke
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the slanting block on the right side
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the slanting block on the left side
```

The above commands will create the uppercase letter "Y" within the allowed space boundaries while following the gravity rules.
