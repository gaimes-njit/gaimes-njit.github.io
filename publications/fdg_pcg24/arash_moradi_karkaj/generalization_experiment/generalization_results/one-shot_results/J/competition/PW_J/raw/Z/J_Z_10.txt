To generate the uppercase letter "Z", the following sequence of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',7)
ab_drop('b31',10)
```

Explanation of each command:

1. `ab_drop('b31',1)`: This command places a horizontal straight block at position 1, representing the top of the "Z" letter.
2. `ab_drop('b11',4)`: This command places a square block at position 4, one unit below the top block.
3. `ab_drop('b11',7)`: This command places another square block at position 7, three units below the top block.
4. `ab_drop('b31',10)`: This command places another horizontal straight block at position 10, five units below the top block, completing the letter "Z".

The resulting letter "Z" will be stable and fit within the allowed space boundaries.
