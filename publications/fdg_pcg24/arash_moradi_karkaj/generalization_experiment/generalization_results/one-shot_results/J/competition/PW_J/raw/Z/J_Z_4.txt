To generate the letter "Z" using the given block types, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  // Place a 1x1 square block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  // Place another 1x1 square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)  // Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)  // Place another 1x1 square block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 5)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 5
```

These commands will create the shape of the letter "Z" within the allowed space and maintain structural stability according to the gravity rules.
