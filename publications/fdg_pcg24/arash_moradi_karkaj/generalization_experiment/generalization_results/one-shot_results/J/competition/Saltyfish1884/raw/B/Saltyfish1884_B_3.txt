To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "B" using the ab_drop() function and meet all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) to create a solid base on layer 0:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
This creates a stable base for the structure.

3. Place the first vertical block (b13) on top of the base:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

4. Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

5. Place the second vertical block (b13) on top of the horizontal block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

6. Place the top blocks (b11 or b13) to complete the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 14)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```

After following these steps, the structure created using the ab_drop() function should resemble the character "B" and meet all the stability constraints.
