To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "C" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the placement of each block. Let's break down the steps to achieve this:

Step 1: Define the structure
Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base blocks
To ensure stability, we need to start by placing the base blocks (b11 or b13) that will support the structure. Let's place a b13 block at the bottom left corner and a b13 block at the bottom right corner:
```python
structure[0][0] = 'b13'
structure[0][W-1] = 'b13'
```

Step 3: Place the vertical block
Next, we need to place a vertical block (b13) in the middle of the structure to form the vertical part of the "C". To ensure stability, we should place it on top of the base blocks. Let's place it in the middle slot (W/2):
```python
structure[1][W//2] = 'b13'
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal block
Finally, we need to place a horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block to complete the shape of the "C". This block should also be placed on top of the base blocks for stability. Let's place it at the same slot (W/2) as the vertical block:
```python
structure[2][W//2] = 'b31'
```

Step 5: Use the ab_drop() function
Now that we have defined the structure, we can use the ab_drop() function to put the suitable blocks in place. We will start by dropping the base blocks, followed by the vertical block, and finally the horizontal block. Here's how the code looks like:
```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Drop the left base block
ab_drop('b13', W-1)  # Drop the right base block
ab_drop('b13', W//2)  # Drop the vertical block
ab_drop('b31', W//2)  # Drop the horizontal block
```

Step 6: Display the final structure
To visualize the final structure, we can print each row of the structure:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The resulting structure should resemble the character "C" and satisfy all hard constraints. Note that you can adjust the placement of the blocks or modify the structure as needed to meet different requirements.
