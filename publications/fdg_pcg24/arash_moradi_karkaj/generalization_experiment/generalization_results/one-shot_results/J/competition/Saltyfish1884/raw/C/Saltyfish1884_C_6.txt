To generate a stable structure that resembles the character 'C' while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code: `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`

2. Place a b31 block on the base at the leftmost slot (slot 0) using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 0)`

3. Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`

4. Place a b13 block on top of the previous b13 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`

5. Place a b31 block on top of the b13 blocks, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 3)`

6. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b11', 4)`

7. Place a b31 block on top of the b11 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 5)`

8. Place a b13 block on top of the previous b31 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b13', 6)`

9. Place a b31 block on top of the b13 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 7)`

10. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b11', 8)`

11. Place a b31 block on top of the b11 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 9)`

12. Place a b13 block on top of the previous b31 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b13', 10)`

13. Place a b31 block on top of the b13 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 11)`

14. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b11', 12)`

15. Place a b31 block on top of the b11 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 13)`

16. Place a b13 block on top of the previous b31 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b13', 14)`

17. Place a b31 block on top of the b13 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 15)`

18. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b11', 16)`

19. Place a b31 block on top of the b11 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 17)`

20. Place a b13 block on top of the previous b31 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b13', 18)`

21. Place a b31 block on top of the b13 block, slightly offset towards the right, using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 19)`

After following these steps, the structure grid will resemble the character 'C' and will meet all the hard constraints, including stability and no boundary intrusion.
