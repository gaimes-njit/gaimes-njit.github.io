To generate a stable structure resembling the character "E", we will follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the base block (b11) at the bottom layer (0) and center it at slot 9 using the `ab_drop(1, 9)` function:
```
ab_drop(1, 9)
```

3. Drop the vertical block (b13) next to the base block at slot 10 to form the left vertical stroke of the "E":
```
ab_drop(3, 10)
```

4. Drop the horizontal block (b31) on top of the left vertical stroke at slot 9, aligned with the base block to form the top horizontal stroke of the "E":
```
ab_drop(2, 9)
```

5. Drop the horizontal block (b31) below the left vertical stroke at slot 9, aligned with the base block to form the bottom horizontal stroke of the "E":
```
ab_drop(2, 9)
```

6. Drop another vertical block (b13) to the right of the bottom horizontal stroke at slot 11 to complete the right vertical stroke of the "E":
```
ab_drop(3, 11)
```

7. Lastly, drop a horizontal block (b31) on top of the right vertical stroke at slot 9, aligned with the base block to connect the top and bottom horizontal strokes of the "E":
```
ab_drop(2, 9)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "E", meeting all the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
