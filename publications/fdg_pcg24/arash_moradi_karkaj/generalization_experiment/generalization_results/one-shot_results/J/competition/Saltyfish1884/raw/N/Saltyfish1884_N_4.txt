To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.

2. Place a b31 block on the base (layer 0) at the middle slot (slot 9) using the ab_drop() function. This will serve as the vertical line of the "N" character.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Place a b13 block on the top left of the vertical line. To do this, use the ab_drop() function with the block type 'b13' and the slot number y=8, aligning it with the left side of the vertical line.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

4. Place a b11 block on the top right of the vertical line. Similarly, use the ab_drop() function with the block type 'b11' and the slot number y=10, aligning it with the right side of the vertical line.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

5. Repeat step 4 to place another b11 block above the first one, aligning it with the right side of the vertical line.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

6. Repeat step 3 to place another b13 block above the first one, aligning it with the left side of the vertical line.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

7. The final result will be a stable structure that resembles the character "N". You can visualize the structure by printing the elements of the grid.

```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Here is the complete code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 8)

for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This code will generate a stable structure resembling the character "N" and meeting all the given requirements.
