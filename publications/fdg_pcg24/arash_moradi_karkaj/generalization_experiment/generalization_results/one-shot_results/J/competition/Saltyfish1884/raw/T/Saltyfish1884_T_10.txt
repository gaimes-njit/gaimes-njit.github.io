To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks.

First, let's consider the stability constraints:
1. A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
2. Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
3. The structure should not be separated.

Based on these constraints, we can determine the following steps to form the structure:

Step 1: Drop a b11 block at slot 9 (center) on layer 0 as the base.

Step 2: Drop a b31 block at slot 9 (center) on layer 1 to create the vertical part of the "T". This block will rest on the base.

Step 3: Drop a b13 block at slot 8 (left) on layer 1 to create the horizontal part of the "T". This block will also rest on the base.

Step 4: Drop a b13 block at slot 10 (right) on layer 1 to complete the horizontal part of the "T". This block will rest on the base.

Step 5: Drop a b11 block at slot 9 (center) on layer 2 to create the top part of the "T". This block will rest on the vertical part of the "T".

Step 6: Drop a b11 block at slot 9 (center) on layer 3 to further stabilize the structure. This block will rest on top of the vertical part of the "T".

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T".

To use the ab_drop() function to implement these steps, we can write the following code:

```
W = 20  # Width of the map
H = 16  # Height of the map

# Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop a b11 block at slot 9 on layer 0 as the base
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop a b31 block at slot 9 on layer 1 to create the vertical part of the "T"
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop a b13 block at slot 8 on layer 1 to create the horizontal part of the "T"
ab_drop('b13', 8)

# Drop a b13 block at slot 10 on layer 1 to complete the horizontal part of the "T"
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Drop a b11 block at slot 9 on layer 2 to create the top part of the "T"
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop a b11 block at slot 9 on layer 3 to further stabilize the structure
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all the hard constraints.
