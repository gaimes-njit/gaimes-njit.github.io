To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "V", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11) at the bottom of the structure to form a solid base:

```python
for i in range(7, 14):
    ab_drop('b11', i)
```

This will place 8 b11 blocks starting from slot 7 to slot 14.

3. Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the base blocks to form the center of the "V" shape:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

This will place a b13 block in the center slot, aligned with the base blocks.

4. Place the horizontal block (b31) on each side of the vertical block to complete the "V" shape:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

This will place two b31 blocks, one at slot 9 and the other at slot 11, aligned with the base blocks.

5. To meet the stability constraint (5.1), we have ensured that the blocks are placed on a solid base, as b31 blocks are supported by the base blocks. We have also placed the blocks as low as possible.

6. To meet the no boundary intrusion constraint (5.2), we have ensured that the blocks do not intrude on the boundary of the map.

The final structure grid will resemble the character "V" and meet all the given requirements.
