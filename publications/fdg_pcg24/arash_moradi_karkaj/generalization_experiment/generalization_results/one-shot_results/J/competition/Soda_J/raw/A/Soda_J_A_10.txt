To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "A" in the Tetris game, we can follow these steps:

1. Create the base of the letter "A":
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
This will create a horizontal block at the bottom of the grid.

2. Add the top-left slanted line of the letter "A":
```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```
This will create a vertical block on the left side of the base.

3. Add the top-right slanted line of the letter "A":
```
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```
This will create a vertical block on the right side of the base.

By following these steps, we will create a structure in the level that resembles the capital letter "A". The blocks will be placed in a bottom-to-top fashion and will form the desired shape.

Complete Implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```
