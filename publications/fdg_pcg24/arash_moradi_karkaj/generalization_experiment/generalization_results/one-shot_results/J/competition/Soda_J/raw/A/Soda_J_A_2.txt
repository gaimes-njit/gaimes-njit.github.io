In order to create the letter "A" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks - two angled blocks and one horizontal block.

Here is the step-by-step implementation to create the letter "A":

```
# Step 1: Place the two angled blocks
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Angle block 1
ab_drop("b13", 12) # Angle block 2

# Step 2: Place the horizontal block
ab_drop("b31", 10) # Horizontal block
```

This implementation will create a stable structure of the letter "A" in the level. The first angled block is placed at position (8, 1), (9, 1), and (10, 1). The second angled block is placed at position (12, 1), (13, 1), and (14, 1). The horizontal block is placed at position (9, 0), (10, 0), and (11, 0).

Please note that the implementation assumes that the level is empty at the beginning. If there are existing blocks in the level, you may need to adjust the placement positions accordingly to create a stable structure.
