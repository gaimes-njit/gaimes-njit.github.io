To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "A" (TARGET) using the block-stacking problem techniques, we can break down the "A" into three blocks: a top bar, a middle bar, and a bottom bar. Here's how we can generate the "A" structure:

1. Place the top bar:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Place the middle bar:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

3. Place the bottom bar:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

By following these steps, we can successfully create a structure that looks like the capital letter "A".

Complete implementation code:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
