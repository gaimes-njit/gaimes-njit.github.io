To create a structure that looks like the letter "A", we need to create three blocks: two diagonal lines and a horizontal bar. We will start from the bottom and work our way up to ensure stability. 

Here is the code to create the structure:

```python
# Diagonal lines of the A
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Left diagonal line
ab_drop("b31", 11)  # Right diagonal line

# Horizontal bar of the A
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This code drops the blocks in the correct order and positions them to create an "A" shape. The left diagonal line is placed at x_position 9, the right diagonal line is placed at x_position 11, and the horizontal bar is placed at x_position 10.

Note: The stability of the structure is not guaranteed in this code. Additional adjustments may be needed to enforce stability.
