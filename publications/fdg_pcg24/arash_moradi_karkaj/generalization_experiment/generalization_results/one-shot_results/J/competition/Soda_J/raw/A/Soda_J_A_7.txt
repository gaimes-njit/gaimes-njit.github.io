To create a structure that looks like the letter "A", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the top horizontal bar of the "A" using the row block "b31":
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Place the two diagonal bars of the "A" using the column block "b13". We will place one on the left and one on the right side of the top horizontal bar:
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

3. Place the bottom horizontal bar of the "A" using the row block "b31":
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
