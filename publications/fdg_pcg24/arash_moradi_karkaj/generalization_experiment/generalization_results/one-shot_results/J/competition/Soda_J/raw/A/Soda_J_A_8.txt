To create the capital letter "A", we can break it down into three parts: the two legs and the crossbar. 

First, we will create the two legs of the letter "A" using the "b31" block type. We will start from the bottom and move upwards. 

```
# Left leg of A
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)

# Right leg of A
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```

Next, we will create the crossbar of the letter "A" using the "b13" block type. We will place it on top of the two legs. 

```
# Crossbar of A
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

By following these steps, we will have successfully created the capital letter "A" in the level.
