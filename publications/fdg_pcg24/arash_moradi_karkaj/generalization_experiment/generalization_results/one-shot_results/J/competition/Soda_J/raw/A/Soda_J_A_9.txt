The first step is to create the base of the letter "A". We can achieve this by dropping a row block in the center of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the two legs of the letter "A". Again, we will use row blocks, but this time we will drop them at the positions that align with the base of the "A".

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Finally, we need to create the top part of the letter "A". We can achieve this by dropping a column block at the center of the grid, making sure it aligns with the top of the legs.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
