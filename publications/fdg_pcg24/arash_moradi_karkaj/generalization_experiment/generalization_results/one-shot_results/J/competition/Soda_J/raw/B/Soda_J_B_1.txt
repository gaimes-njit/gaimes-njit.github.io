To create the letter "B" in the level, we will break it down into three blocks: a row block, a column block, and another row block.

Here is the step-by-step implementation to create the letter "B":

1. Dropping the first row block (b31), centered at x_position=3:
ab_drop("b31", 3)

2. Dropping the column block (b13), centered at x_position=4:
ab_drop("b13", 4)

3. Dropping the second row block (b31), centered at x_position=5:
ab_drop("b31", 5)

The complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
