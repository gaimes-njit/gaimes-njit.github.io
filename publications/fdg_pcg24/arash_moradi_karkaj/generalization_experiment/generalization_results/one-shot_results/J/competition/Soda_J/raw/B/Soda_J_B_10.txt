To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "B" in Tetris, we can break it down into multiple steps. 

Step 1: Create the two vertical columns of the letter "B".

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Step 2: Create the horizontal bar of the letter "B".

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This will create a structure that looks like the letter "B" in a stable and well-supported manner.
