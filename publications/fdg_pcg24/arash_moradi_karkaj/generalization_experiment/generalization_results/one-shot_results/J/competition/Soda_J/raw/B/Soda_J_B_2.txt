To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "B", we can divide it into three parts: the two vertical bars and the horizontal connector in the middle.

Here is the step-by-step implementation of the structure using the ab_drop() function:

1. Place the left vertical bar:
```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

2. Place the right vertical bar:
```
ab_drop("b31", 15)
```

3. Place the horizontal connector:
```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

This completes the structure that looks like the capital letter "B". The left vertical bar is centered at column 5, the right vertical bar is centered at column 15, and the horizontal connector is centered at columns 8, 9, and 10. The order of block placement ensures stability and similarity to the target character.
