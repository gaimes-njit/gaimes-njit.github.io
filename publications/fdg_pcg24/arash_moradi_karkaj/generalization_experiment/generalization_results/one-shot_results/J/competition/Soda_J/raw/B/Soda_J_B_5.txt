1. To start building the letter B, we need a vertical column block (b13). We can place it at the center of the grid, with x_position=9, to ensure stability.
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

2. Next, we need to add the top horizontal bar of the letter B. We can use a row block (b31) and place it one cell above the vertical column block, at x_position=9.
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

3. Now, we need to add the bottom horizontal bar of the letter B. Again, we can use a row block (b31) and place it one cell below the vertical column block, at x_position=9.
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

4. Finally, we need to add the small vertical line on the right side of the letter B. We can use a column block (b13) and place it one cell to the right of the vertical column block, at x_position=10.
```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

The complete implementation to build the letter B in the level with stability and similarity is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```
