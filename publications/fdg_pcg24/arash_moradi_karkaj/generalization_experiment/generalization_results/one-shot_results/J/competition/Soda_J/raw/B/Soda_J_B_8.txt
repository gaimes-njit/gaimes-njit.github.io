To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter 'B', we can break it down into multiple blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the code implementation:

```
# Building the base of the 'B'
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Building the top part of the 'B'
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by building the base of the 'B' using a row block (`b31`) and two column blocks (`b13`). The row block is placed at x_position 8, and the two column blocks are placed at x_position 9. This creates the bottom-left part of the 'B'.
2. Next, we continue building the base of the 'B' by placing another row block (`b31`) at x_position 9. This completes the bottom part of the 'B'.
3. Now, we move on to building the top part of the 'B'. We start by placing three square blocks (`b11`) at x_positions 9, 10, and 11. This creates the left vertical bar of the 'B'.
4. Next, we place a column block (`b13`) at x_position 11 to extend the vertical bar of the 'B' downwards.
5. Finally, we place another square block (`b11`) at x_position 12 to complete the top part of the 'B'.

The completed implementation will result in a structure that looks like the capital letter 'B', with stable and balanced blocks.
