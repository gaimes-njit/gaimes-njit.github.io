First, let's create the base of the letter C by dropping a row block horizontally at the bottom of the grid:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Next, we will drop a column block on top of the base to form the left side of the letter C:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

Finally, we will drop another column block on top of the base, but slightly to the right to form the right side of the letter C:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

Using these three ab_drop() calls in sequence, we will be able to create a structure in the level that resembles the letter C.
