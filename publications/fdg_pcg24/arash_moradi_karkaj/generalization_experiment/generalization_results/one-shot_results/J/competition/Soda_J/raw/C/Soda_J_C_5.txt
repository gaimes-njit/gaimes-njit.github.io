The given task is to generate a structure in the form of the letter "C" in the Tetris game. The structure should be built in a bottom-to-top fashion and must be stable.

To achieve this, we can break down the letter "C" into several blocks and drop them in the appropriate positions. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. First, we drop two column blocks on the left side to form the vertical part of the letter "C":
```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

2. Next, we drop a row block above the vertical part to form the top of the letter "C":
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

3. Finally, we drop a row block below the vertical part to form the bottom of the letter "C":
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```
