To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "C", we can break it down into three blocks: the curved part on the left, the vertical bar in the middle, and the curved part on the right. 

Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the left curved part:
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 6)

2. Drop the vertical bar:
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

3. Drop the right curved part:
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)

And that's it! By following these steps, we can create a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "C".
