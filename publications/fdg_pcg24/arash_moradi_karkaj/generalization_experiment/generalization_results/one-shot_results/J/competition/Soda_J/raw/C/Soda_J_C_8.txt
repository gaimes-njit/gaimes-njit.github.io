To create a structure in the shape of a capital "C", we will need to place multiple blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. 

Here is the implementation to create the "C" structure:

```
# Place the base of the "C" structure
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 6)

# Place the middle part of the "C" structure
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

# Place the top part of the "C" structure
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

This implementation creates a "C" structure by placing blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability and similarity to the target character. Each ab_drop() call represents placing a block at a specific position in the grid.
