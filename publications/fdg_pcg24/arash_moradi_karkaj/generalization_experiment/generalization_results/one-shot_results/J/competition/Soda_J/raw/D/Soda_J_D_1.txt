The first step is to create the base of the "D" shape. We will use a row block (b31) to create the bottom part of the letter.

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

Next, we will create the curved part of the "D" shape using a column block (b13). We will place it at the rightmost column of the base.

```
ab_drop("b13", 19)
```

Finally, we will create the top part of the "D" shape using a row block (b31). We will place it one row above the curved part.

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 19)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```
