To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "D", we can break it down into two blocks: a vertical pipe and a semicircular shape. 

Here is the complete implementation that ensures stability and similarity:

```
# Place the vertical pipe block
ab_drop("b13", 4)

# Place the semicircular shape block
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

This implementation first places the vertical pipe block at position (4, 0) and then builds the semicircular shape by placing the appropriate blocks in a sequential order. The structure will be stable as each block is well-supported, and it will resemble the capital letter "D".
