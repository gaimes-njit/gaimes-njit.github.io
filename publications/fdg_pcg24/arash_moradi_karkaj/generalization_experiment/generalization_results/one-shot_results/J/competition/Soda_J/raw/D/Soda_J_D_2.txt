To create the capital letter "D" in the level, we can break it down into two blocks: the vertical pipe and the bottom half circle.

First, we will create the vertical pipe using a column block "b13" at the center of the grid. This will form the straight part of the "D" shape.

```python
# Creating the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, we will create the bottom half circle using a row block "b31" at the center of the grid, one row below the bottom end of the pipe. This will form the curved part of the "D" shape.

```python
# Creating the bottom half circle
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

The complete implementation to generate the capital letter "D" in the level is as follows:

```python
# Creating the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Creating the bottom half circle
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```
