The first step is to create the base of the "D" shape by dropping a row block at the bottom center of the grid:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the vertical line of the "D" shape. We can do this by dropping a column block at the center of the grid, one row above the base:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, we need to create the top curve of the "D" shape. We can do this by dropping a row block one row above the vertical line, at the right side of the vertical line:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

The complete implementation to generate a "D" shape is as follows:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

This implementation creates a stable "D" shape structure that resembles the target character.
