To build the letter D, we can break it into three blocks: the upper half circle, the vertical line, and the bottom half circle.

Here is the complete implementation to build the letter D:

```
# Building the upper half circle
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 7)

# Building the vertical line
ab_drop("b31", 7)

# Building the bottom half circle
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

This implementation starts by building the upper half circle from left to right, then places the vertical line at the center, and finally constructs the bottom half circle from left to right.

This implementation ensures stability by building the structure from the bottom to the top and by properly supporting each block with the blocks beneath it.
