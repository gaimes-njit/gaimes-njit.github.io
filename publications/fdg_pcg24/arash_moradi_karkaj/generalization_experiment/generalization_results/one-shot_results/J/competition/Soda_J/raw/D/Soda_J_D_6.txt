The first step is to create the base of the "D" shape. We can achieve this by using a row block "b31" and placing it at the bottom of the grid. 

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the vertical part of the "D" shape. We can achieve this by using a column block "b13" and placing it at the same x-position as the previous block. 

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, we need to create the top part of the "D" shape. We can again use a row block "b31" and place it just above the previously placed block. 

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to create a "D" shape is as follows:

```python
# The base of the "D" shape
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# The vertical part of the "D" shape
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# The top part of the "D" shape
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
