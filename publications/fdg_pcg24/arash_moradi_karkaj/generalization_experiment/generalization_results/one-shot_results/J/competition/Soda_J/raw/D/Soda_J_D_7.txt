To create the letter D, we can follow the same approach as for creating the letter E. We need to create a lying-down letter D in order to have a stable structure. 

Here is the implementation to create the letter D in a stable manner:

```
# The base of the letter D
ab_drop("b31", 7)

# The vertical part of the letter D
ab_drop("b13", 7)

# The top part of the letter D
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

This implementation of the ab_drop() function will create the letter D in a stable manner and maximize the similarity with the target character.
