To generate the structure in the shape of the letter "D", we can break it down into multiple blocks and place them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Start by placing the base block of the letter "D" at the bottom-left corner of the grid:
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```
This will create the bottom part of the letter "D".

2. Place the middle block of the letter "D" above the base block:
```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```
This will create the middle part of the letter "D".

3. Place the top block of the letter "D" above the middle block:
```
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```
This will create the top part of the letter "D".

4. Place the dot of the letter "D" above the middle block:
```
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```
This will create the dot of the letter "D".

The complete implementation (without indentation) is as follows:

ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
