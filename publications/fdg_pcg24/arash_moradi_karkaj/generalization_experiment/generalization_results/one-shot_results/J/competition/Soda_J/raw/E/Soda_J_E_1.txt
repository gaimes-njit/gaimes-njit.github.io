To create a structure that looks like the letter "E" in Tetris, we can follow the hints provided. We will start by creating the top bar, then the vertical part, and finally the bottom bar.

Here is the code implementation:

```
# The top bar
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)

# The vertical part
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)

# The bottom bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```

This code will first create the top bar of the "E" at the positions (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), and (12, 0). Then it will create the vertical part of the "E" at the positions (9, 1), (10, 1), and (11, 1). Finally, it will create the bottom bar of the "E" at the positions (9, 2), (10, 2), (11, 2), (12, 2), and (13, 2).

This implementation ensures stability by adding blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, and it closely resembles the letter "E" in the correct orientation.
