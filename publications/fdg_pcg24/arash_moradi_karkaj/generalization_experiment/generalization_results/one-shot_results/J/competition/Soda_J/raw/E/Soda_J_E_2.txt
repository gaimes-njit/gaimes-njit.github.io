In order to create a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "E", we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical bars and one horizontal bar. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the first vertical bar on the left side:
```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

2. Place the horizontal bar on top of the vertical bar:
```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

3. Place the second vertical bar on the right side:
```
ab_drop("b13", 18)
```

By following these steps, we will have a stable structure in the shape of the letter "E" that resembles the TARGET character.
