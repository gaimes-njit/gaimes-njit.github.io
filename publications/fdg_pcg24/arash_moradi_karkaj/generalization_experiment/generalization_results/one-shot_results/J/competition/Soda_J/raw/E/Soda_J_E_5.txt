To create the letter "E" in a stable and similar manner, we can break it down into three blocks: the top bar, the middle bar, and the bottom bar. 

First, we will place the top bar:

```
# Place the top bar
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Next, we will place the middle bar:

```
# Place the middle bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Finally, we will place the bottom bar:

```
# Place the bottom bar
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

With these three blocks, we have successfully created the letter "E" in a stable manner.
