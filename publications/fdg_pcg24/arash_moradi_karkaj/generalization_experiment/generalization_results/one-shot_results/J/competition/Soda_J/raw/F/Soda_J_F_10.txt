To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "F", we need to place three blocks in a specific order. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the horizontal bar of the "F".
ab_drop("b31", 4)

Step 2: Place the vertical bar of the "F".
ab_drop("b13", 4)

Step 3: Place the bottom bar of the "F".
ab_drop("b31", 3)

The complete implementation to generate the letter "F" structure in the level is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```
