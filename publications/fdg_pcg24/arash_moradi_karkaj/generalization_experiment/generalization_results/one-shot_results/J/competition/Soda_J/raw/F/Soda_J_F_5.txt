To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "F" in the level, we will use the hints provided and build the structure in a bottom-to-top fashion. 

1. First, we will create the base of the "F" using a row block ("b31"). We will place it in the center of the level.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Next, we will create the vertical bar of the "F" using a column block ("b13"). We will place it just to the right of the base block.

ab_drop("b13", 10)

3. Lastly, we will create the top bar of the "F" using another row block ("b31"). We will place it just above the vertical bar, in line with the base block.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
