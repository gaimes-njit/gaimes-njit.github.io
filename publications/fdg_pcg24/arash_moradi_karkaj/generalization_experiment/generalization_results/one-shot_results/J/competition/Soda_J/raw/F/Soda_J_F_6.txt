To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "F" in the Tetris game, we can follow these steps:

1. Create the vertical bar of the "F":
   - ab_drop("b13", 9)

2. Create the horizontal bar of the "F":
   - ab_drop("b31", 8)
   - ab_drop("b31", 9)
   - ab_drop("b31", 10)

Here's the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
