To build the letter "F" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can start by stacking the base of the letter using a row block ("b31"). Then, we can add the vertical bar of the letter using a column block ("b13"). Finally, we can add the horizontal bar of the letter using a row block ("b31").

The complete implementation to build the letter "F" is as follows:

```
# Stack the base of the letter "F"
ab_drop("b31", 8)

# Stack the vertical bar of the letter "F"
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# Stack the horizontal bar of the letter "F"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This implementation ensures the blocks are stacked in a bottom-to-top fashion and maintains stability by balancing the blocks. It will result in a structure that resembles the letter "F" when viewed in the top-down orientation.
