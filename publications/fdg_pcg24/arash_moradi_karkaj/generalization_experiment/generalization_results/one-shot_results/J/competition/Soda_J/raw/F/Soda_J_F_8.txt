The first step to create the letter F is to drop a row block in the center of the grid at the bottom. 

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to drop a column block on the right side of the row block to complete the vertical line of the letter F. 

```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Finally, we need to drop another row block on top of the vertical line to complete the horizontal line of the letter F. 

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
``` 

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
