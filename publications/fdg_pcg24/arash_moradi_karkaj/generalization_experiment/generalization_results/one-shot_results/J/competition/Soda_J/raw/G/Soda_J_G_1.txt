To generate a structure that looks like a capital "G", we can break it down into multiple blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop a row block (b31) at x_position=4:
```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

2. Drop a column block (b13) at x_position=4:
```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```

3. Drop a square block (b11) at x_position=4:
```
ab_drop("b11", 4)
```

4. Drop a column block (b13) at x_position=3:
```
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

5. Drop a row block (b31) at x_position=3:
```
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

6. Drop a column block (b13) at x_position=5:
```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

7. Drop a row block (b31) at x_position=5:
```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

By following these steps, we can generate a structure that resembles the capital "G".
