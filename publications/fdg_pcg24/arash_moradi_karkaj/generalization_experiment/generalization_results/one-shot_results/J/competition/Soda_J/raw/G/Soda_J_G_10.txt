To create a structure that looks like the letter G, we can break it down into several blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step code implementation:

```python
# Step 1: Place the base block (bottom bar of G)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Step 2: Place the left vertical part of G
ab_drop("b13", 11)

# Step 3: Place the middle horizontal bar of G
ab_drop("b31", 11)

# Step 4: Place the right vertical part of G
ab_drop("b13", 12)

# Step 5: Place the top horizontal bar of G
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# Step 6: Place the top right corner of G
ab_drop("b11", 12)

# Step 7: Place the bottom right corner of G
ab_drop("b11", 11)

```

This code will drop the blocks one by one, starting from the base and building upwards to form the letter G. The blocks are placed in a way that ensures stability, and the final structure will resemble the letter G.
