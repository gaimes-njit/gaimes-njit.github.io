In order to create a structure that looks like the capital letter "G", we can break it down into smaller blocks and build it up step by step. Here is the implementation to generate the structure:

1. Build the base of the letter "G":
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Build the top horizontal bar of the letter "G":
ab_drop("b31", 8)

3. Build the vertical part of the letter "G":
ab_drop("b13", 9)

4. Build the bottom horizontal bar of the letter "G":
ab_drop("b31", 9)

This implementation will create a structure that looks like the capital letter "G". It ensures stability by starting from the bottom and building up in a bottom-to-top fashion.
