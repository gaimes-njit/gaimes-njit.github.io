To build the capital character "G", we can break it down into four separate blocks: two column blocks ("b13") for the vertical parts of the G, and two row blocks ("b31") for the horizontal parts of the G.

Here is the complete implementation of the code to generate the "G" structure using ab_drop() function:

```
# Placing the first column block
ab_drop("b13", 6)

# Placing the second column block
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Placing the top horizontal block
ab_drop("b31", 6)

# Placing the bottom horizontal block
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion and that the structure is stable. The resulting structure will look like the capital letter "G" when viewed from the top.
