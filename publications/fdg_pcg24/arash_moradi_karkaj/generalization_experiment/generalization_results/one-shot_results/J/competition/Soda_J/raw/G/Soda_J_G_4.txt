To generate a structure that looks like a capital "G" in the level, we can break it down into different blocks and stack them vertically. 

Here is the complete implementation to create a stable and similar "G" structure:

```
# The top horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)

# The vertical part
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 3)

# The bottom horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top approach, stacking the blocks one by one to create the desired structure. The code also ensures stability by balancing each block and its support. Finally, the resulting structure should resemble the letter "G".
