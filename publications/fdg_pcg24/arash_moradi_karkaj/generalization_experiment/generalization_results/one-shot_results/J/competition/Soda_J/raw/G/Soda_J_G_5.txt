To create the capital letter "G" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into three blocks: a top bar, a vertical pipe, and the bottom bar. Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the top bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Place the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Place the bottom bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation will create a structure that resembles the letter "G".
