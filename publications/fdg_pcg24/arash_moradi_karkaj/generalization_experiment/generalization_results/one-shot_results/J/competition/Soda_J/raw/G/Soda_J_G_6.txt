To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "G", we need to carefully place the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. Let's break down the implementation step by step:

1. First, we need to build the base of the "G" structure. We can use a column block ("b13") for this. We will place it at the center of the grid, which is x_position = 9.

ab_drop("b13", 9)

2. Next, we will add the vertical part of the "G" structure. Again, we will use a column block ("b13") and place it one cell to the right of the base column. This will create the vertical line of the "G".

ab_drop("b13", 10)

3. Lastly, we will add the top bar of the "G" structure. For this, we will use a row block ("b31") and place it above the middle cell of the vertical line. This will complete the "G" shape.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete implementation will look like this:

ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
