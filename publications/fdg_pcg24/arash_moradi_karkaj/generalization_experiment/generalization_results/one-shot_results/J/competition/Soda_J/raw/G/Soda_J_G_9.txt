To create the letter G using the given blocks, we can break it down into three parts - the top bar, the middle bar, and the bottom curve. 

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# The top bar
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# The middle bar
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# The bottom curve
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Note: The above implementation assumes that the blocks are dropped from the top and centered accordingly. The positions of the blocks might need to be adjusted based on the size of the block and the desired alignment in the G shape.
