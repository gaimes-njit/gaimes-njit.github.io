To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "H", we can follow the given hints and build the structure in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the code implementation:

```
# Step 1: Place the two vertical bars of the "H" structure
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Placing the left vertical bar
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Placing the right vertical bar

# Step 2: Place the horizontal bar of the "H" structure
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Placing the horizontal bar
```

By following these steps, the structure will resemble the capital letter "H" and ensure stability.
