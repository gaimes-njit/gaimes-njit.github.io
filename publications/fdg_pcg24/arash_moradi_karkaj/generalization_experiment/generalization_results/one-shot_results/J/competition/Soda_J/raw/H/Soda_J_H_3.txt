To generate the structure in the shape of the letter "H", we need to follow the instructions given and place the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion.

Here is one possible implementation:

```python
# Place the base of the "H" (b31)
ab_drop("b31", 8)

# Place the top part of the "H" (b31)
ab_drop("b31", 8)

# Place the center part of the "H" (b13)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This implementation will create a stable structure in the shape of the letter "H" on the grid.
