The first step is to create the horizontal bar of the letter H. We can achieve this by placing a row block (b31) at the center of the grid. 

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the two vertical bars of the letter H. We can do this by placing two column blocks (b13) on either side of the horizontal bar. 

```python
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

Finally, we need to create the bottom base of the letter H. We can do this by placing a row block (b31) at the bottom of the two vertical bars. 

```python
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Putting it all together, here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```
