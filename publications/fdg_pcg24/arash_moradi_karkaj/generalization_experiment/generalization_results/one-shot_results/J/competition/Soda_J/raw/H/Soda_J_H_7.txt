To create the capital letter "H" in the level, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the two vertical bars of the "H":
   - ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Left vertical bar
   - ab_drop("b31", 11)  # Right vertical bar

2. Place the horizontal bar of the "H":
   - ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Horizontal bar

The complete implementation to create the "H" structure with the best stability and similarity is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Left vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 11)  # Right vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Horizontal bar
```

This implementation will generate a structure that resembles the capital letter "H" in the level.
