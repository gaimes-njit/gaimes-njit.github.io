The first step is to create the two vertical bars of the letter H. We can achieve this by dropping two "b13" blocks side by side. 

```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

Next, we will create the horizontal bar of the letter H by dropping a "b31" block. We need to ensure that it is centered properly, so we will place it at position 10.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

To complete the letter H, we need to add two more "b13" blocks to the horizontal bar. We will center them at positions 8 and 12.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```
