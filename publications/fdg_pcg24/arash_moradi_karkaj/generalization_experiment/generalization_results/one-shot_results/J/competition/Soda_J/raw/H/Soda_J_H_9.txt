To generate a structure that looks like the letter "H" in the Tetris game, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the base of the "H", which is a row block (b31), at the desired position.
2. Place two column blocks (b13), one on each side of the base, to complete the vertical bars of the "H".

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the base of the "H" at position 9
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Place the left vertical bar at position 8
ab_drop("b13", 10) # Place the right vertical bar at position 10
