To generate the letter I in the level, we need to place a column block (b13) in the center of the grid.

``` python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This will create a vertical column from cells (8, 0) to (10, 0) which represents the letter I.

The complete implementation to generate the letter I would be:

``` python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
