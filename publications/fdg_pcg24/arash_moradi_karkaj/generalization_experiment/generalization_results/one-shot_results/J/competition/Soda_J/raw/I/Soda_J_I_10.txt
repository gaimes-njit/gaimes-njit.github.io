First, let's create the base of the letter "I" with a row block placed at the bottom center of the grid:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, let's add the vertical part of the letter "I" by placing a column block on top of the base block:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, let's complete the letter "I" by placing another row block on top of the vertical block:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
