To generate the capital letter "I" in the level, we can use two row blocks ('b31') stacked on top of each other. Here's the code to achieve that:

```
# Drop the first row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Drop the second row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This code will create a stable structure that looks like the letter "I" in the top-down orientation.
