To create the letter "I" using the block-stacking technique, we can start by dropping a row block "b31" at the center of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we can drop a column block "b13" at the center of the grid, just above the row block to form the letter "I".

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This arrangement of blocks will create a structure that resembles the capital letter "I". It balances properly and is stable under gravity.

Here's the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
