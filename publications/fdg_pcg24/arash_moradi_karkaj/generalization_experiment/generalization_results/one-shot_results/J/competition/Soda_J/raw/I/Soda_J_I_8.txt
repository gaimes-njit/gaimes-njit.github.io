To create the letter "I" in the level, we can use two column blocks placed next to each other. Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the first column block
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Place the second column block next to the first one
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

In this implementation, we first place a column block at x_position = 9, centered in the 10th column of the grid. Then we place another column block at x_position = 10, centered in the 11th column of the grid. This creates the shape of the letter "I" in the level.
