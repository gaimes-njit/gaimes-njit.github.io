To generate the target structure, we need to use the "b31" block to create the vertical bar of the "I" and the "b13" block to create the horizontal bar.

Here is the code to generate the "I" structure:

```python
# Create the vertical bar of the "I"
ab_drop("b31", 0)

# Create the horizontal bar of the "I"
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first `ab_drop("b31", 0)` call creates a vertical bar at the leftmost column of the grid.
- The second `ab_drop("b13", 2)` call creates a horizontal bar at the third column of the grid, centered relative to the vertical bar.

This code will generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "I" in the grid.
