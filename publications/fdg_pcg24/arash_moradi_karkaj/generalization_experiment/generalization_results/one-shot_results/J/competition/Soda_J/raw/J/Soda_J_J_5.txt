The first step is to create the top bar of the letter "J". We can achieve this by dropping a row block ("b31") at x_position=8.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Next, we need to create the vertical part of the letter "J". We can do this by dropping a column block ("b13") at x_position=9.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, we need to create the bottom tick of the letter "J" by dropping another row block ("b31") at x_position=9.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
