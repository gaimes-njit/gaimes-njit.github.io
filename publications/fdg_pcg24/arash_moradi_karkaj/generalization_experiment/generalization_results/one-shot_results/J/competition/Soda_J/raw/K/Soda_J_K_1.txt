To generate the letter "K", we can break it down into three blocks: one column block and two row blocks.

First, we need to create the column block. We can use the "b13" block type and drop it at the center of the grid.
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the two row blocks. We can use the "b31" block type and drop one block to the left of the column block and the other to the right.
```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

The complete implementation to generate the letter "K" in the best stability and similarity is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```
