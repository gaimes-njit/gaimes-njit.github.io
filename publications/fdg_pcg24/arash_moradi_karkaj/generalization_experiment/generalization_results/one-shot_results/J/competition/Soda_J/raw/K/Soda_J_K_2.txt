To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "K", we can follow the steps below:

1. Start by placing the base of the letter "K" using the row block "b31". Place it at the center of the grid, which is at x_position=9.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Place the vertical parts of the letter "K" using the column block "b13". Place one of the vertical parts to the left of the base, at x_position=8.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

3. Place the other vertical part to the right of the base, at x_position=10.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

4. The resulting structure should resemble the capital letter "K" in a top-down orientation.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Note: The above code assumes that the ab_drop function will handle the stability and boundary intrusion constraints to ensure a stable and valid structure.
