To build the letter "K" shape in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical columns and one horizontal bar. Here's the implementation to achieve the desired structure:

1. Drop the first vertical column block at x_position=7:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```
2. Drop the second vertical column block at x_position=10:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
3. Drop the horizontal bar at the top of the vertical columns, starting from x_position=6 and ending at x_position=11:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This implementation creates a stable structure that looks like the letter "K".
