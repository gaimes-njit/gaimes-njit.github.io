To create the shape of the letter "K" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks - a vertical bar, a diagonal bar, and a horizontal bar. 

Here is how we can create the letter "K" using the `ab_drop()` function:

1. Create the vertical bar of the "K":
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

2. Create the diagonal bar of the "K":
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

3. Create the horizontal bar of the "K":
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

By dropping the blocks in this order, we ensure that each block is balanced and well-supported, leading to a stable structure. The resulting structure will resemble the letter "K".

Complete Implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
