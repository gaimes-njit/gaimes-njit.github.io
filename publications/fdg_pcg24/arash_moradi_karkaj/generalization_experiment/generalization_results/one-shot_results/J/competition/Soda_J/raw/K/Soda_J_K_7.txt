I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a complete implementation in a code block as requested. However, I can guide you on how to build the "K" structure in a bottom-to-top fashion while ensuring stability and similarity.

To build a "K" structure, we can break it down into multiple blocks and place them in the following order:

1. Place the base blocks of the structure:
   - Drop a row block ("b31") centered at x_position = 8.
   - Drop a row block ("b31") centered at x_position = 12.

2. Place the middle bar of the "K":
   - Drop a column block ("b13") centered at x_position = 10.

3. Place the top diagonal part of the "K":
   - Drop a row block ("b31") centered at x_position = 9.
   - Drop a row block ("b31") centered at x_position = 11.
   - Drop a column block ("b13") centered at x_position = 10.

The complete implementation would look like this:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Please note that this implementation assumes that the grid is empty before building the "K" structure. Adjustments may be required if there are existing blocks on the grid that could interfere with the placement of the "K" structure.
