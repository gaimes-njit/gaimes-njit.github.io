To create the capital letter "K" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into three parts - the two vertical bars and the diagonal bar.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the first vertical bar on the left side:
ab_drop("b31", 4)

2. Place the second vertical bar on the right side:
ab_drop("b31", 15)

3. Place the diagonal bar connecting the top of the two vertical bars:
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 13)

The complete implementation to create the letter "K" is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)     # Place the first left vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 15)    # Place the second right vertical bar
ab_drop("b13", 11)    # Place the diagonal bar (part 1)
ab_drop("b13", 12)    # Place the diagonal bar (part 2)
ab_drop("b13", 13)    # Place the diagonal bar (part 3)
```
