To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "L", we can follow the instructions provided in the hints. Here is the complete implementation:

```
# First, create the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Then, create the bottom bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation places a vertical pipe block centered at x=9, which occupies cells (8,0), (9,0), and (10,0). Then, it places a row block centered at x=9, which occupies cells (9,1), (9,2), and (9,3). Together, these blocks form the letter "L" shape.
