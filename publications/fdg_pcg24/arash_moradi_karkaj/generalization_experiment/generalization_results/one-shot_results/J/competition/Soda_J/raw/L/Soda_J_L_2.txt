To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "L", we can start by dropping a "b31" block at the bottom center of the grid. This will serve as the base of the "L" shape. Then, we can drop a "b13" block on top of the base block to form the vertical part of the "L" shape. Finally, we can drop another "b31" block at the right end of the vertical block to form the bottom bar of the "L" shape.

Here is the complete implementation to generate the "L" shape:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
