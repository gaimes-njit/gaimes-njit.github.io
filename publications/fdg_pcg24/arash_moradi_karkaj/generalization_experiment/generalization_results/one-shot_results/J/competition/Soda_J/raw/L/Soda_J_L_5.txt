In order to generate a structure that looks like the capital character "L" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can use the following `ab_drop()` calls:

```
# Step 1: Place the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Step 2: Place the bottom bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This will create a structure that resembles the letter "L" in a bottom-to-top fashion.
