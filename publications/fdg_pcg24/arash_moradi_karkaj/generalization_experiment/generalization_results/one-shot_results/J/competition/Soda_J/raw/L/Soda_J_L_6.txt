The first step is to create the vertical part of the letter L. We can achieve this by dropping a column block ("b13") at the center position:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the bottom bar of the letter L. We can achieve this by dropping a row block ("b31") at the center position:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to generate an L-shaped structure is:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
