To create a structure that looks like the letter "L" (TARGET), we can use three blocks: one square block (b11) and two column blocks (b13).

Here is the complete implementation to create the "L" structure:

```
ab_drop("b11", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

Explanation:
1. The first `ab_drop("b11", 0)` command drops a square block at the leftmost position (x=0).
2. The second `ab_drop("b13", 1)` command drops a column block next to the square block at position x=1, creating the vertical part of the "L".
3. The third `ab_drop("b13", 3)` command drops another column block next to the vertical part at position x=3, creating the horizontal part of the "L".

This implementation ensures that the blocks are stacked in a bottom-to-top fashion. The resulting structure will resemble the letter "L" and will be stable under gravity.
