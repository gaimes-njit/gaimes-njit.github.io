To create the letter "L" in the top-down orientation, we need to drop two blocks: a vertical pipe and a bottom bar. Here is the code to achieve that:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # bottom bar
```

This will create a structure resembling the letter "L". However, the structure may not be stable, so we need to add additional support to make it stable. Here is an updated code that ensures stability:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # additional support for stability
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # bottom bar
```

By adding an additional block, we provide support for the vertical pipe, making the structure stable.
