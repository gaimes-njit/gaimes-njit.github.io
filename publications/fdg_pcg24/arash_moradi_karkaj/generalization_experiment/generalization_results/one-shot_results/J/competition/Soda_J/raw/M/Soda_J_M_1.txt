To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "M", we can break it down into three blocks: two rows and one column. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the first row block:
```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

2. Place the left column block:
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

3. Place the right column block:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

4. Place the second row block:
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

The complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```
