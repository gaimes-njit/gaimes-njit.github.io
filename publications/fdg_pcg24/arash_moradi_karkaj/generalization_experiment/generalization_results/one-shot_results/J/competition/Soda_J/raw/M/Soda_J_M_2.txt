To generate a structure that looks like a capital "M," we can break it down into three blocks: two diagonal blocks forming the sides of the "M" and a horizontal block forming the middle.

Here is the complete implementation to create the "M" structure:

```python
# Drops the first diagonal block
ab_drop("b13", 4)

# Drops the second diagonal block
ab_drop("b13", 6)

# Drops the horizontal block
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

This implementation will create a structure that resembles the letter "M" when viewed in the natural orientation (top-down). The blocks are dropped bottom-to-top to ensure stability and to meet the requirements of the block-stacking problem.
