The first step is to create the two vertical bars of the letter M.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

Next, we need to create the middle diagonal bar of the letter M.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

Finally, we need to create the two diagonal bars at the sides of the letter M.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```
