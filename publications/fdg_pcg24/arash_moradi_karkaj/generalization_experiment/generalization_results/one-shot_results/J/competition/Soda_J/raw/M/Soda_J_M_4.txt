To generate a structure that looks like the letter "M" by using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into multiple blocks and drop them in a specific order. Here is the code to create a stable "M" structure:

```
# The left and right bars of the M
ab_drop("b31", 7)   # Left bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # Right bar

# The slanted middle part of the M
ab_drop("b13", 8)   # Middle part
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Middle part

# The base of the M
ab_drop("b31", 8)   # Left base
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Right base
```

Explanation of the code:

- The first two blocks dropped are the left and right bars of the "M". They are both row blocks "b31" and are centered at x-positions 7 and 9, respectively.

- Next, the slanted middle part of the "M" is dropped. It consists of two column blocks "b13" placed vertically. The first block is centered at x-position 8 and the second block is centered at x-position 9.

- Finally, the base of the "M" is created using two row blocks "b31". The left base block is centered at x-position 8 and the right base block is centered at x-position 10.

By following the above code, the resulting structure will resemble the letter "M" and it will be stable, ensuring that the blocks won't move due to gravity.
