To generate a structure in the shape of the letter M, we can break it down into several blocks and drop them in the correct order and positions. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Create the base of the M:
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 15)

2. Create the two diagonal parts of the M:
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 14)

3. Create the center horizontal bar of the M:
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter M.
