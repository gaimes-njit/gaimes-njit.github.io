To generate the letter "M" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into three parts: two vertical bars at the sides and one slanted bar in the middle. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the left vertical bar of the "M":
ab_drop("b31", 7)

2. Place the slanted bar in the middle of the "M":
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

3. Place the right vertical bar of the "M":
ab_drop("b31", 11)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

This implementation will create a structure in the level that resembles the letter "M" and ensures stability using the block-stacking technique.
