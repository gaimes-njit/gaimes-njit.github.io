In order to create the letter M, there are multiple ways to approach it. One possible approach is as follows:

1. Create the left diagonal of the letter M:
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)

2. Create the middle of the letter M:
ab_drop("b13", 6)

3. Create the right diagonal of the letter M:
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
