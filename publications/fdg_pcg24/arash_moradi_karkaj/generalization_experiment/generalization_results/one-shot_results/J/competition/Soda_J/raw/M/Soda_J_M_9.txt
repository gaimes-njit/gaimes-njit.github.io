To create the letter "M" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two column blocks and one row block. 

Here is the step-by-step implementation to create the letter "M":

```python
# Place the first column block on the left side
ab_drop("b13", 5)

# Place the second column block in the middle
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# Place the row block on top of the two column blocks
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This implementation creates a structure that resembles the letter "M" in the level. Each block is placed in a way that ensures stability and similarity to the target character.
