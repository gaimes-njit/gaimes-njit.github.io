First, let's start by creating the vertical bar of the N:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, let's create the diagonal bar of the N:

```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

Now, let's create the horizontal bar of the N:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Finally, let's reinforce the stability of the N by adding additional blocks:

```
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
```

This completes the implementation for creating an N in the level, ensuring stability and similarity.
