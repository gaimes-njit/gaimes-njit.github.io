To create the letter "N" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: a vertical pillar, a diagonal slant, and another vertical pillar. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Create the first vertical pillar:
```
# The left vertical pillar
ab_drop("b31", 5)
``` 

2. Create the diagonal slant:
```
# The diagonal slant
ab_drop("b13", 6)
``` 

3. Create the second vertical pillar:
```
# The right vertical pillar
ab_drop("b31", 7)
``` 

This implementation will create the letter "N" in the level in a bottom-to-top fashion while maintaining stability.
