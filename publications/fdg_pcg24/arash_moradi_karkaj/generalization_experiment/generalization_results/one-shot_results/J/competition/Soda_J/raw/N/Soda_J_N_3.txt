To create the capital letter "N" in the level, we can break it down into three parts:

1. The left vertical bar
2. The diagonal bar going from the top left to the bottom right
3. The right vertical bar

Here is the implementation step by step:

1. Place the left vertical bar:
```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

2. Place the diagonal bar:
```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

3. Place the right vertical bar:
```
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```
