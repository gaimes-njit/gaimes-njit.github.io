To create the letter N, we can break it down into three parts: the left vertical bar, the diagonal middle bar, and the right vertical bar. 

Here is the code to generate the letter N:

```
# Place the left vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 4)

# Place the diagonal middle bar
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# Place the right vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 15)
```

This code will create a structure in the shape of the letter N, with the left vertical bar starting at column 4, the diagonal middle bar starting at column 10, and the right vertical bar starting at column 15.
