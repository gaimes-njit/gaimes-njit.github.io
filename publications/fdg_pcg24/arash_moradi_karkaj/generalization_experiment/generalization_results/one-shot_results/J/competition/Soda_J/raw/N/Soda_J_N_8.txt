To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "N", we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical pipes and a horizontal bar. 

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the first vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 4)

# Place the horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# Place the second vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top approach and ensures stability by placing each block on a well-supported base. By dropping the blocks in the specified order and positions, we create a structure that resembles the letter "N".
