To create the letter O, we can start by placing a row block horizontally at the bottom. Then, we will place a column block vertically on each side of the row block to form the sides of the "O". Finally, we will place another row block at the top to complete the "O" shape.

Here is the complete implementation to create the letter O:

```
# Place the bottom row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Place the left column block
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# Place the right column block
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# Place the top row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion and creates a structure that looks like the letter O.
