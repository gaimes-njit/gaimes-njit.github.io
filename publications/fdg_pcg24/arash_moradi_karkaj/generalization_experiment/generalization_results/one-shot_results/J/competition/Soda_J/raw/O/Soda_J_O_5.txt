To create the capital "O" shape, we can start by dropping two row blocks horizontally, and then drop two column blocks vertically to complete the shape.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

This will create the desired capital "O" shape in the level.
