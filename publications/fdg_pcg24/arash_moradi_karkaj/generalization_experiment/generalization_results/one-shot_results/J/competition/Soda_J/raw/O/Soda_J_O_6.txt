To create the letter O, we can start by placing a row block (b31) at the top. We will then place a square block (b11) on either side of the row block to form the circular shape.

Here is the code implementation for creating the letter O:

```
# Place the top row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Place the first square block on the left
ab_drop("b11", 8)

# Place the second square block on the right
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

This will create a stable structure that resembles the letter O.
