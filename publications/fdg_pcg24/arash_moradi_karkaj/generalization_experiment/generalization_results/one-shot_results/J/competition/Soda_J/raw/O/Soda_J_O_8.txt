To generate the structure of the letter O, we can start by creating a column block at the center of the grid. Then, we can create a row block above and below the column block to form the letter O shape.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Explanation:
1. The first line drops a column block (b13) at x_position 9. This block will occupy cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).
2. The second line drops a row block (b31) at x_position 9. This block will occupy cells (8, 1), (9, 1), and (10, 1), above the column block.
3. The third line drops another row block (b31) at x_position 11. This block will occupy cells (10, 1), (11, 1), and (12, 1), below the column block.

With this implementation, we will achieve a stable structure that resembles the letter O.
