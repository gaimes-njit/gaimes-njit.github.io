# First, we need to create a stable base for the "O". 
# We can use the "b31" block type to create a horizontal row of cells that will act as the base.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Next, we need to build the vertical sides of the "O".
# We can use the "b13" block type to create two vertical columns on both sides of the base.

ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# Finally, we need to create the top horizontal bar of the "O".
# We can use the "b31" block type again to create a horizontal row on top of the vertical sides.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

# The above code will create a structure that resembles the letter "O" in the level with the best stability and similarity.
