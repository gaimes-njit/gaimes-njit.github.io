First, let's start by creating the base of the "P" shape. We can do this by placing a row block at the bottom-left corner of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

Next, we need to create the vertical part of the "P" shape. We can do this by placing a column block on top of the base, aligned with the first block.

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

Finally, we can create the horizontal part of the "P" shape by placing a row block on top of the vertical part, aligned with the first block.

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to generate a "P" shape is:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```
