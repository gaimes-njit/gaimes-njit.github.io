To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "P", we can break it down into two blocks: a vertical pillar and a horizontal bar.

1. Drop the vertical pillar:
   ab_drop("b13", 6)

2. Drop the horizontal bar:
   ab_drop("b31", 4)

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```
