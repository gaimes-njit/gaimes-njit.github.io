To create the letter Q, we can break it down into three blocks: the top bar, the middle pipe, and the bottom bar. The complete implementation to create the letter Q is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # Top bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Middle pipe
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # Bottom bar
```

This implementation ensures the best stability and similarity to the letter Q.
