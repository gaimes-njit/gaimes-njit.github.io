To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Q" (TARGET), we can break it down into two blocks: 
1. A square block for the bottom part of the letter.
2. A row block placed above the square block to form the loop of the letter.

Here is the code to generate the letter "Q" using the ab_drop() function:

```
# Place the square block at the bottom of the grid
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# Place the row block above the square block to form the loop of the letter
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

By dropping the blocks in this order and position, we can achieve stability and similarity to the letter "Q".
