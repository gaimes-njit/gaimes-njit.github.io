To build the structure resembling the letter "Q", we can divide it into three main blocks: the square part of the letter, the vertical part of the letter, and the horizontal bar of the letter. 

1. Building the square part of the letter "Q":
Since the square block is already stable, we can place it at the bottom-left corner of the grid. 

```python
ab_drop("b11", 0)  # Place the square block at the bottom-left corner
```

2. Building the vertical part of the letter "Q":
To create the vertical part of the letter, we can use a column block and place it to the right of the square block. 

```python
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Place the column block to the right of the square block
```

3. Building the horizontal bar of the letter "Q":
Next, we need to create the horizontal bar of the letter "Q". We can achieve this by placing a row block above the square block and extending it to the right until it aligns with the top of the vertical block. 

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)  # Place the row block above the square block
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Extend the row block to the right until it aligns with the top of the vertical block
```

By following these steps, we have successfully created the structure resembling the letter "Q". The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b11", 0)  # Place the square block at the bottom-left corner
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Place the column block to the right of the square block
ab_drop("b31", 0)  # Place the row block above the square block
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Extend the row block to the right until it aligns with the top of the vertical block
```
