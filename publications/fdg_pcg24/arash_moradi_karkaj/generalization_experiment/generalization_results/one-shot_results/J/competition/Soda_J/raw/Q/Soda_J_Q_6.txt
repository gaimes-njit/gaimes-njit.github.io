To create the structure of the letter "Q" in the level, we can break it down into multiple blocks and stack them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Create the base of the letter "Q" using a row block 'b31' and center it at x_position=9.
ab_drop("b31", 9)

Step 2: Create the vertical part of the letter "Q" using a column block 'b13' and center it at x_position=9.
ab_drop("b13", 9)

Step 3: Create the tick of the letter "Q" using a row block 'b31' and center it at x_position=9.
ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete implementation is as follows:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

This code will generate a structure in the level that resembles the capital letter "Q".
