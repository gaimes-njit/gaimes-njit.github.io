To create a structure that looks like the letter "Q", we can break it down into three blocks: a square block for the top, a column block for the vertical line, and a row block for the bottom line. We can drop these blocks in the following order:

1. Drop the square block on top:
   ab_drop("b11", 9)
   
2. Drop the column block for the vertical line:
   ab_drop("b13", 9)
   
3. Drop the row block for the bottom line:
   ab_drop("b31", 10)
   
The complete implementation code is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "Q" in the level.
