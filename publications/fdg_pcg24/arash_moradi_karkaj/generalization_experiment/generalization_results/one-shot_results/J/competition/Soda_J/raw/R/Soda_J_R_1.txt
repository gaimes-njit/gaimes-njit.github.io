The first step is to create the base of the capital letter "R". 

To create the base, we will use a row block (b31) and position it in the bottom center of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Now, let's create the vertical line of the "R". We will use a column block (b13) and position it to the right of the base.

```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Finally, let's create the top diagonal line of the "R". We will use a row block (b31) and position it above the vertical line, slightly to the left.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation ensures the best stability and similarity to the capital letter "R".
