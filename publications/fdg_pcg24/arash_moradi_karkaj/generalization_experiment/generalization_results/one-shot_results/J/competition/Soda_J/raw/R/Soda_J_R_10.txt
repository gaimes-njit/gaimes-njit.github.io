To generate a structure that looks like the letter "R" in Tetris, we can follow the approach mentioned in the hints. We will create the structure in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability and similarity.

Step 1: Create the vertical part of the letter "R"
```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

Step 2: Create the horizontal bar of the letter "R"
```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

Complete implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```
