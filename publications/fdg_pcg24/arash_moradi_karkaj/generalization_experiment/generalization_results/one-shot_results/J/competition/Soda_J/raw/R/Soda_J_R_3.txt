To generate a structure that looks like the letter "R" in the Tetris game, we can follow these steps:
1. Create the vertical part of the letter "R".
2. Create the bottom bar of the letter "R".

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Step 1: Create the vertical part of the letter "R"
ab_drop("b31", 3)  # Place the vertical part on x_position=3

# Step 2: Create the bottom bar of the letter "R"
ab_drop("b13", 3)  # Place the bottom bar on x_position=3
```

The above code will generate a structure that resembles the letter "R" in the Tetris game.
