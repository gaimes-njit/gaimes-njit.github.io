The first step is to create the base of the "S" character by dropping two row blocks next to each other and a column block above them. We can achieve this by following the given instructions:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)    # Place the left row block
ab_drop("b31", 8)    # Place the right row block
ab_drop("b13", 7)    # Place the column block
```

Next, we need to add the top section of the "S" character. This can be done by dropping a row block on top of the right row block and a column block above the left row block. Again, following the given instructions:

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)    # Place the top row block
ab_drop("b13", 7)    # Place the top column block
```

Finally, we can add the bottom section of the "S" character by dropping a row block on top of the left row block and a column block above the right row block. Following the instructions:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)    # Place the bottom row block
ab_drop("b13", 8)    # Place the bottom column block
```

At this point, the implementation is complete and the structure should resemble the capital letter "S".
