First, let's start by creating the base of the "S" shape. We can use a row block "b31" for this.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

Next, we need to create the top-left part of the "S" shape, which consists of a column block "b13" and a square block "b11".

```python
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
```

Now, let's create the bottom-right part of the "S" shape, which is a row block "b31".

```python
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

Finally, we need to add the top-right part of the "S" shape, which is a column block "b13" and a square block "b11".

```python
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```
