The first step is to create the base of the letter "S" using a row block. We can center it at x_position=3 to cover cells (2, 0), (3, 0), and (4, 0).

```python
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

Next, we can create the top curve of the letter "S" using a column block. We can center it at x_position=2 and place it at y=1 to cover cells (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3).

```python
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

Finally, we can create the bottom curve of the letter "S" using another column block. We can center it at x_position=5 and place it at y=2 to cover cells (5, 2), (5, 3), and (5, 4).

```python
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```
