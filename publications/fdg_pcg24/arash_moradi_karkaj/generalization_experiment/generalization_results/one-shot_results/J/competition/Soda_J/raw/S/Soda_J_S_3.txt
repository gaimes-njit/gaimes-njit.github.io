To generate a structure that looks like a capital "S" (TARGET), we can break it down into three blocks: a horizontal bar, a diagonal bar, and another horizontal bar. Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 0) # First horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 1) # Diagonal bar
ab_drop("b31", 2) # Second horizontal bar

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "S".
