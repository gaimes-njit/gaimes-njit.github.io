To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "S", we need to carefully drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. We will start by creating the bottom horizontal bar of the "S" using two row blocks and a column block. Here is the code:

```
# Bottom horizontal bar of "S"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, we will create the top horizontal bar of the "S" using two row blocks and a column block. Here is the code:

```
# Top horizontal bar of "S"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, we will create the diagonal connection between the two horizontal bars using two row blocks and a square block. Here is the code:

```
# Diagonal connection of "S"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This completes the implementation of the structure that looks like the capital letter "S". The blocks are dropped in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability, and the resulting structure should resemble the letter "S".
