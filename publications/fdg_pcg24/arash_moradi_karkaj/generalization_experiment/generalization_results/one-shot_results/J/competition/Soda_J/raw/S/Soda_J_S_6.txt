To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "S" using the ab_drop() function, we can break down the letter into four blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion. The blocks needed are:
- Two vertical blocks (b31)
- Two horizontal blocks (b13)

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "S" when viewed from the top-down orientation.
