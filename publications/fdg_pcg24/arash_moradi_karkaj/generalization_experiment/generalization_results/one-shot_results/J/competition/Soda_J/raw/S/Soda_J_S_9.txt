The first step is to create the base of the "S" shape. To do this, we can drop a "b13" block in the middle bottom of the grid. This will serve as the center bottom block of the "S" shape. 

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the top part of the "S" shape. This can be done by dropping a "b31" block on top of the center bottom block. We need to center the block horizontally with respect to the center bottom block. 

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Now, we need to create the bottom part of the "S" shape. This can be done by dropping another "b31" block on the right side of the center bottom block. Again, we need to center the block horizontally with respect to the center bottom block.

```
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Finally, we need to create the middle part of the "S" shape. This can be done by dropping a "b13" block on top of the previously created bottom part. We need to center the block horizontally with respect to the bottom part.

```
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```
