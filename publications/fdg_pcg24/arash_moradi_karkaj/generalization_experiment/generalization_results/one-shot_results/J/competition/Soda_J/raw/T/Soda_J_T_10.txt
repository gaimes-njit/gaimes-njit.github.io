To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "T", we can follow the given hints and use the ab_drop() function to drop blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Drop the base of the "T"
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Drop the vertical part of the "T"
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Drop the horizontal part of the "T"
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation first drops a row block ("b31") to create the base of the "T" at x_position=9. Then, it drops a column block ("b13") to create the vertical part of the "T" at the same x_position. Finally, it drops another row block ("b31") to create the horizontal part of the "T" at the same x_position.

With this implementation, the structure will be stable and it will resemble the capital letter "T" in its natural top-down orientation.
