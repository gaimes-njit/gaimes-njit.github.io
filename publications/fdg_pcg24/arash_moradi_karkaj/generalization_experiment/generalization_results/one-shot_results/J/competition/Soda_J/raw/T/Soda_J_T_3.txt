To build the target character "T" using the given ab_drop() function, we will break it down into three blocks - a horizontal bar and two vertical pipes. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the horizontal bar at the center:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Drop the first vertical pipe at the left of the bar:
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

3. Drop the second vertical pipe at the right of the bar:
```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

The complete implementation can be represented as follows:

```
# Horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Left pipe
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# Right pipe
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```
