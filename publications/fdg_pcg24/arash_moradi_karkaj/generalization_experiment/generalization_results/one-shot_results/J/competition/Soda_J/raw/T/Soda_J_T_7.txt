To create the capital letter "T", we can use the following steps:

1. Place the base of the "T" using a row block:
ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Place the vertical part of the "T" using a column block:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

3. Place the top part of the "T" using a row block:
ab_drop("b31", 9)

By following these steps, we will generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "T". The blocks will be placed in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability. The resulting structure will closely resemble the target character. 

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
