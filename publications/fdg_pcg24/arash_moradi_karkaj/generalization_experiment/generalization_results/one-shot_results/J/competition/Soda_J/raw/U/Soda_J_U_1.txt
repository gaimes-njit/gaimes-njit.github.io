To generate a structure that looks like the letter "U", we need to build the base first and then add the sides. Here is the complete implementation (without indentation) using the ab_drop() function:

# Step 1: Drop the base of the "U"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Step 2: Drop the sides of the "U"
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

By following these steps, we first create the base of the "U" by dropping three row blocks with the ab_drop() function centered at the positions 7, 8, and 9. Then, we add the sides of the "U" by dropping two column blocks with the ab_drop() function centered at the positions 6 and 10.

This implementation ensures the stability of the structure by placing the blocks bottom-to-top and follows the correct order of dropping the blocks to generate the desired "U" shape.
