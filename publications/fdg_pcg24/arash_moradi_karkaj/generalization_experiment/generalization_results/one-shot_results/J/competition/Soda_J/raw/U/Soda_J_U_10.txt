Here is the complete implementation to generate a structure that looks like the letter "U" on the given level:

1. Dropping the bottom base of the "U":
```
# Bottom part of the U
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

2. Dropping the left side of the "U":
```
# Left side of the U
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

3. Dropping the right side of the "U":
```
# Right side of the U
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

The implementation above should generate a structure that resembles the letter "U" in the level.
