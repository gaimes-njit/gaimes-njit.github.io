To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital character "U", we can follow the instructions mentioned in the hints. We will first create the bottom part of the "U" and then build the top part.

1. Creating the bottom part of the "U":
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at the center of the grid:
     ```
     ab_drop("b31", 9)
     ```
   - Drop a column block ("b13") at the center of the grid, one slot to the right:
     ```
     ab_drop("b13", 10)
     ```
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at the center of the grid, two slots to the right:
     ```
     ab_drop("b31", 11)
     ```

2. Creating the top part of the "U":
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at the center of the grid:
     ```
     ab_drop("b31", 9)
     ```
   - Drop a column block ("b13") at the center of the grid, one slot to the right:
     ```
     ab_drop("b13", 10)
     ```
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at the center of the grid, two slots to the right:
     ```
     ab_drop("b31", 11)
     ```

Complete implementation:

```python
# Creating the bottom part of the "U"
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

# Creating the top part of the "U"
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Note: The stability and similarity of the structure will depend on the underlying physics and rendering engine of the game. The code provided ensures that the blocks are stacked in a bottom-to-top fashion, which is crucial for stability. However, there may be variations in the final appearance of the "U" due to factors such as gravity, block interaction, and graphical rendering.
