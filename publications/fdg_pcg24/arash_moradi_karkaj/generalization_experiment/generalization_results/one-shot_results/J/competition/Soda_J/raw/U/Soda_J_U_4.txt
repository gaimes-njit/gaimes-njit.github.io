To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "U" in Tetris, we need to first create the base of the U shape and then build the sides. The structure should be built in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. Here is the implementation:

```
# Step 1: Create the base of the U shape
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Step 2: Build the left side of the U shape
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 7)

# Step 3: Build the right side of the U shape
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This implementation creates the base using three row blocks ("b31") centered at columns 7, 8, and 9. Then, it builds the sides of the U shape by stacking two column blocks ("b13") on both the left and right sides of the base.

This implementation ensures stability by building the structure in a bottom-to-top fashion, with each block being well-supported by the blocks below it. It also results in a structure that resembles the capital letter "U".

Note: The actual stability and similarity of the structure may vary depending on the specifics of the Tetris game implementation and the block physics.
