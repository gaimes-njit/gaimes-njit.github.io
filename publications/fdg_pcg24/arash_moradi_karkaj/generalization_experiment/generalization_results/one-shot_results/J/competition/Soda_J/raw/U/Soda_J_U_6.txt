To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "U", we need to build the base and then stack blocks on top to form the sides of the letter. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Build the base of the "U":
ab_drop("b31", 3)  # Place a row block at position 3 to form the base of the "U"

2. Build the sides of the "U":
ab_drop("b13", 0)  # Place a column block at position 0 for the left side of the "U"
ab_drop("b13", 6)  # Place a column block at position 6 for the right side of the "U"

3. Check the stability and similarity of the structure.
