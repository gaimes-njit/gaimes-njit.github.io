The goal is to generate a structure that looks like the letter U in a level with a width (W) of 20 columns and a height (H) of 16 rows.

To create the letter U, we can break it down into three blocks - a row block for the top, a column block for the left side, and another column block for the right side.

Here's the step-by-step implementation to create the letter U structure:

1. Place the row block for the top:
   ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Place the left column block:
   ab_drop("b13", 5)

3. Place the right column block:
   ab_drop("b13", 13)

Finally, put the complete implementation to create the U structure:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```

This implementation ensures stability and generates a structure that resembles the letter U.
