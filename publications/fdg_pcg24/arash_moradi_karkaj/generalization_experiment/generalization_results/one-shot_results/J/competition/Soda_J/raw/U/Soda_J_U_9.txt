To create a structure that looks like the letter "U" in the top-down orientation, we can break it down into three blocks - two side blocks and one bottom block. Here is the complete implementation to generate the U structure:

```python
# Place the left side block
ab_drop("b31", 6)

# Place the right side block
ab_drop("b31", 13)

# Place the bottom block
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top approach, ensuring structural stability and similarity to the target character "U".
