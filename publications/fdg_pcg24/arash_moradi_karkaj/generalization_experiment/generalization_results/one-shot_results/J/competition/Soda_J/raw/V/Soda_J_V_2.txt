To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "V" (TARGET), we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the left vertical part of the "V"
ab_drop("b13", 7)

Step 2: Place the right vertical part of the "V"
ab_drop("b13", 10)

Step 3: Place the bottom bar of the "V"
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
