To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "V", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() calls:

1. Place the bottom left block of the "V":
   ab_drop("b13", 4)

2. Place the bottom right block of the "V":
   ab_drop("b13", 14)

3. Place the middle block of the "V":
   ab_drop("b13", 9)

By dropping the blocks in this order, we ensure that the bottom blocks are placed first and the upper blocks are placed on top of them, creating a stable structure. The resulting structure will have the shape of the capital letter "V".

Complete Implementation:

ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
