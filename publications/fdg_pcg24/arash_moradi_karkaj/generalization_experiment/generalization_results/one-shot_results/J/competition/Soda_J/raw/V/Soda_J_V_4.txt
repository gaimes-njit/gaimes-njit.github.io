To create the capital letter "V" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into three blocks: two diagonal blocks and one square block. 

Here is the implementation:

1. Drop the first diagonal block on the left side:
ab_drop("b31", 5)

2. Drop the square block just above the first diagonal block:
ab_drop("b11", 6)

3. Drop the second diagonal block on the right side:
ab_drop("b31", 7)
