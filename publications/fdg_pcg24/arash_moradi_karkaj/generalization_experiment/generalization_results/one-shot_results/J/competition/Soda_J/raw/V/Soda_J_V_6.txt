To generate a structure that looks like a capital "V", we can start by placing two row blocks at the bottom to form the base of the "V". 

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)   # Place the left row block
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Place the right row block
```

Next, we need to add the diagonal blocks to complete the "V" shape. We can use column blocks to achieve this.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Place the left column block
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Place the right column block
```

Finally, we can add additional row blocks to the top of the "V" to make it taller if desired.

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)   # Place the left row block
ab_drop("b31", 11)  # Place the right row block
```

This complete implementation will generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "V".
