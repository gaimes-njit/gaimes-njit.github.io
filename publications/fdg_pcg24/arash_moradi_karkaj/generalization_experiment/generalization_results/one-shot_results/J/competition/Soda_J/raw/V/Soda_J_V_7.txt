To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "V" (TARGET), we can break it down into two parts - the top of the "V" and the bottom of the "V". We will use the bottom-to-top approach to build the structure.

The bottom of the "V" can be represented by a column block (b13) placed at the center of the grid. The top of the "V" can be represented by a row block (b31) placed directly above the bottom block. 

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the bottom block (b13)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Place the top block (b31) directly above the bottom block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This code will generate a structure that resembles the capital letter "V". Both blocks are placed at x_position=9, which is the center of the grid. The bottom block occupies cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0). The top block occupies cells (8, 1), (9, 1), and (10, 1).

The structure will be stable and resemble the letter "V" when evaluated.
