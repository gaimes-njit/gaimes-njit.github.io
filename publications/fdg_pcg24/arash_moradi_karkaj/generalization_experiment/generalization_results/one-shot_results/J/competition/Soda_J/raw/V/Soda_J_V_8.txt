To create a structure in the shape of the letter "V", we can break it down into three parts: the top part, the middle part, and the bottom part. Each part will consist of different block types and will be dropped at different positions.

Here's the step-by-step implementation for creating the letter "V":

1. Drop the bottom bar of the letter "V":
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

2. Drop the left part of the letter "V":
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

3. Drop the right part of the letter "V":
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Now, combining these steps, here's the complete implementation for creating the letter "V":

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This implementation ensures the best stability and similarity to the letter "V".
