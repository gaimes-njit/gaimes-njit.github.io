To create a structure that looks like a capital "V" using the given ab_drop() function, we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Place the bottom left part of the "V" shape.
ab_drop("b13", 6)

Step 2: Place the bottom right part of the "V" shape.
ab_drop("b13", 13)

Step 3: Place the top part of the "V" shape.
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

The complete implementation to create a "V" shape structure would be:

ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
