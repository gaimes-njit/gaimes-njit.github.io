First, let's create the base of the "W" shape by dropping two rows of "b31" blocks at the bottom-center of the grid:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Next, let's add the upper part of the "W" shape by dropping a row of "b13" blocks just above the base blocks:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

To complete the "W" shape, let's add the diagonal lines by dropping two "b11" blocks above the center cell:

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```
