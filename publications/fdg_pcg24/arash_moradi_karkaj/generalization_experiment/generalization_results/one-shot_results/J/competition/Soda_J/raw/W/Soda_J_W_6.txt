To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "W" using the block-stacking technique, we can break the shape down into smaller blocks and stack them in a bottom-to-top fashion. 

Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Start by dropping the base blocks of the "W" shape. We can use the "b31" block type for this. Place the first base block at x_position=4, the second base block at x_position=8, and the third base block at x_position=12.

ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 12)

2. Next, we'll add the middle section of the "W" shape. We'll use the "b13" block type for this. Place the first middle block at x_position=6, and the second middle block at x_position=10.

ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

3. Finally, we'll add the top section of the "W" shape. Again, we'll use the "b31" block type for this. Place the first top block at x_position=7, and the second top block at x_position=9.

ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
# Base blocks
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 12)

# Middle blocks
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# Top blocks
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation will create a stable structure in the shape of a capital "W".
