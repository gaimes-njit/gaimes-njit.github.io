To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "W" in a 2D grid, we can break it down into three blocks: two rows and one column. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the first row block at the center of the grid:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Place the second row block below the first row:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

3. Place the column block in the middle of the first and second rows:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This code will generate a structure in the form of the letter "W" with the best stability and similarity. Please note that this implementation assumes that the grid is initially empty and that the ab_drop() function takes care of stability.
