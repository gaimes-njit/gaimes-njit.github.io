First, let's create the base of the W shape by placing two column blocks (b13) next to each other.

```
# Base of the W shape
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Next, we'll add the middle section of the W shape by placing a row block (b31) on top of the base.

```
# Middle section
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Finally, we'll add the top section of the W shape by placing two column blocks (b13) on top of the middle section.

```
# Top section
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```
