To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "X", we can break it down into two diagonal blocks and connect them at the center. We can achieve this by following these steps:

1. Place the first diagonal block from bottom left to top right.
2. Place the second diagonal block from bottom right to top left.
3. Fill the gap between the two diagonal blocks with a row block.

Here's the complete implementation:

```
# Step 1: Place the first diagonal block
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)

# Step 2: Place the second diagonal block
ab_drop("b13", 17)
ab_drop("b13", 18)
ab_drop("b13", 19)

# Step 3: Fill the gap with a row block
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

This implementation will create a structure in the shape of the capital letter "X" in the level.
