To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "X" (TARGET), we can use the following ab_drop() calls in a specific order to ensure stability:

```
# Block 1 (bottom-left diagonal)
ab_drop("b13", 4)

# Block 2 (bottom-right diagonal)
ab_drop("b13", 15)

# Block 3 (top-left diagonal)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Block 4 (top-right diagonal)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This arrangement of blocks will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "X".

Please note that the above code assumes that the grid is empty before executing these ab_drop() calls.

However, it's important to mention that the diagonal blocks won't match the "X" target perfectly due to the limited block shapes available. Nevertheless, this arrangement will create a structure that resembles the letter "X" as closely as possible within the constraints of the game.
