To build the letter "X" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two diagonal blocks for the slanting lines, and one horizontal block for the middle part. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the first diagonal block:
ab_drop("b13", 4) 

2. Place the second diagonal block:
ab_drop("b13", 14) 

3. Place the horizontal block:
ab_drop("b31", 9) 

Complete implementation:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
