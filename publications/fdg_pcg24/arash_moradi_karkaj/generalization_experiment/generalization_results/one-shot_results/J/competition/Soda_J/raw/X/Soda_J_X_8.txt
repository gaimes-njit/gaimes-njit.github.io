To create the structure of the letter "X" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two diagonal blocks and one middle bar. We will use the block types "b13" and "b31" to create these blocks.

Here is the step-by-step implementation to create the letter "X" structure:

1. Drop the first diagonal block downwards:
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 4)
   ```

2. Drop the second diagonal block downwards:
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 14)
   ```

3. Drop the middle bar horizontally:
   ```
   ab_drop("b31", 9)
   ```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
