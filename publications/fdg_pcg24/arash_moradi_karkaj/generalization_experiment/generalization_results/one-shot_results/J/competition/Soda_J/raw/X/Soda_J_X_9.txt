To create the letter X, we can break it down into three block placements: two diagonal bars and a center square. Here is the complete implementation for creating a stable and similar X structure:

```
# Place the left diagonal bar
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# Place the right diagonal bar
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 13)

# Place the center square
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```

This implementation first places the left diagonal bar by dropping three column blocks centered at positions 6, 7, and 8. Then, it places the right diagonal bar by dropping three column blocks centered at positions 11, 12, and 13. Finally, it places the center square by dropping individual block pieces at positions 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. This structure forms the letter X, and each block is well-supported and balanced to ensure stability.
