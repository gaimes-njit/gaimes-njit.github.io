To create the structure of the capital letter "Y" in the Tetris game, we can use a combination of square blocks and column blocks. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the base of the letter "Y":

ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place a column block at x_position=9 as the base of the letter "Y".

2. Place the vertical part of the letter "Y":

ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Place a column block at x_position=8 as the vertical part of the letter "Y".

3. Place the top part of the letter "Y":

ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Place a column block at x_position=8 as the top part of the letter "Y".

The complete implementation, without any errors, is as follows:

ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place a column block at x_position=9 as the base of the letter "Y".
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Place a column block at x_position=8 as the vertical part of the letter "Y".
ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Place a column block at x_position=8 as the top part of the letter "Y".
