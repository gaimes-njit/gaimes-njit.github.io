To create a level that resembles the letter "Y", we can break it down into three blocks - the top part, the middle part, and the bottom part. Here is the code to create the "Y" structure:

1. Place the top part:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

2. Place the middle part:
ab_drop("b31", 9)

3. Place the bottom part:
ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete code implementation would look like this:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation will create a stable "Y" structure that resembles the target character.
