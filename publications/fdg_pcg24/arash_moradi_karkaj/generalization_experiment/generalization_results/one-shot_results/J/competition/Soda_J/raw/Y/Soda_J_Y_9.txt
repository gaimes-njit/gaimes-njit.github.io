To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "Y" (TARGET), we can break it down into three blocks: the stem, the top left branch, and the top right branch. 

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the stem block (b31) in the center (x_position=9) of the grid:
    ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Drop the top left branch block (b13) to the left of the stem:
    ab_drop("b13", 8)

3. Drop the top right branch block (b13) to the right of the stem:
    ab_drop("b13", 10)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```
