To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "Z", we can break it down into three blocks:
1. The horizontal top bar of the "Z"
2. The vertical middle part of the "Z"
3. The horizontal bottom bar of the "Z"

Using the hints provided, we can create the "Z" structure as follows:

```
# Step 1: Create the horizontal top bar of the "Z"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Step 2: Create the vertical middle part of the "Z"
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Step 3: Create the horizontal bottom bar of the "Z"
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

This series of `ab_drop()` calls will generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "Z" in the level. The blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.
