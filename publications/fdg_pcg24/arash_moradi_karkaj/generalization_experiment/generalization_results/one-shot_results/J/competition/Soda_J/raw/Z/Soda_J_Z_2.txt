The first step is to create the bottom part of the "Z" shape using a column block "b13". This block will be placed at x_position = 0. 

```python
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

Next, we need to create the top part of the "Z" shape using a row block "b31". This block will be placed at x_position = 1.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Finally, we need to create the middle part of the "Z" shape using another column block "b13". This block will be placed at x_position = 2.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

Combining all three ab_drop() calls, the complete implementation to generate a structure that looks like a capital "Z" (TARGET) is:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```
