The first step is to create the base of the "Z" character. We can achieve this by using two "b13" blocks placed horizontally, followed by a "b31" block placed vertically. Here is the code for creating the base:

```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

Next, we need to create the top part of the "Z" character. We can achieve this by using a "b13" block placed vertically, followed by a "b31" block placed horizontally. Here is the code for creating the top part:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

Finally, we need to create the middle part of the "Z" character. We can achieve this by using a "b13" block placed vertically, followed by a "b13" block placed horizontally. Here is the code for creating the middle part:

```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Putting it all together, here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```
