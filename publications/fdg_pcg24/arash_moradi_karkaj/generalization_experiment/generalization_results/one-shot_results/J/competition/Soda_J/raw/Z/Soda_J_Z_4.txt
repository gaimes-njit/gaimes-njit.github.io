To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital "Z", we can break it down into three blocks: a row block, a column block, and another row block. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the first row block (b31) at the center of the grid:
    ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Place the column block (b13) at the same x position, one row above the previous block:
    ab_drop("b13", 9)

3. Place the second row block (b31) at the same x position, one row above the previous block:
    ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
