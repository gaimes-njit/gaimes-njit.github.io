To create the letter Z, we can break it down into three blocks: a row block, a square block, and a column block. Here is the implementation to create the letter Z:

```
# Place the row block
ab_drop("b31", 1)
# Place the square block
ab_drop("b11", 2)
# Place the column block
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

This implementation will create a structure that resembles the letter Z.
