Let's start by placing the base of the "Z" structure. We will use the row block "b31" and place it at the center of the bottom row. This will create a stable foundation for the rest of the structure.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Next, we will place the diagonal part of the "Z" structure. We will use the column block "b13" and place it above the base, centered vertically. This will create the first diagonal of the "Z" shape.

ab_drop("b13", 10)

Finally, we will place the horizontal part of the "Z" structure. Again, we will use the row block "b31" and place it above the diagonal part, centered horizontally. This will complete the "Z" shape.

ab_drop("b31", 10)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
