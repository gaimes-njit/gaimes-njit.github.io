To generate a structure that looks like a capital "Z" in the level, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the lower horizontal bar of the "Z":
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

2. Place the vertical bar of the "Z":
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

3. Place the upper horizontal bar of the "Z":
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
