To generate a stable structure resembling the character "C" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Pick a starting point for the base of the structure. This point should be towards the left side of the map, around slots 3-5. Let's set `x_base` as the x-position for the base.

2. Drop a block of type 'b11' at the chosen x_base position using the `ab_drop()` function.

```python
ab_drop('b11', x_base)
```

3. Next, drop a series of 'b31' blocks on top of the base to create the vertical portion of the "C" structure. The number of 'b31' blocks needed will depend on the desired height of the structure. Let's define `height_c` as the desired height.

```python
for i in range(height_c):
    ab_drop('b31', x_base)
```

4. To create the horizontal portion of the "C" structure, drop 'b13' blocks at the appropriate slots above the vertical portion. The number of 'b13' blocks needed will depend on the desired width of the structure. Let's define `width_c` as the desired width.

```python
for i in range(1, width_c):
    ab_drop('b13', x_base+i)
```

Note: Make sure to check for stability and avoid boundary intrusion at each step by considering the position and neighboring blocks when calling the `ab_drop()` function. Adjust the starting point, height, and width of the structure as needed to meet the desired goal and constraints.

By following these steps, you can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "C" and meets all the given constraints.
