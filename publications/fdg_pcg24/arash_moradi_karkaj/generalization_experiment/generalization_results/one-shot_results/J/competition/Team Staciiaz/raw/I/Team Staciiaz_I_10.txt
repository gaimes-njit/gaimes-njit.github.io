To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "I" and meets all the given constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. First, initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define the function `ab_drop()` as provided in the instructions.

3. Start by dropping a b31 block at slot 9 using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`. This will create the vertical portion of the "I" character.

4. Next, drop a b13 block at slot 9 using `ab_drop('b13', 9)`. This will create the horizontal portion of the "I" character.

5. Finally, drop another b31 block at slot 9 to complete the structure. The final code will look like this:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # Function definition as provided in the instructions

# Drop the vertical portion of the "I" character
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the horizontal portion of the "I" character
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Complete the structure by dropping another vertical block
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The resulting structure will be a stable representation of the character "I" that satisfies all the constraints.
