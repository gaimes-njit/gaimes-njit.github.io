To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "R" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully position and order the blocks to meet the constraints. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the given code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base block (b11) at the bottom layer (layer 0) and the center slot (slot 10) using the `ab_drop()` function:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

3. Place the vertical block (b13) at the top left corner of the base block. We can use the `ab_drop()` function twice to achieve this:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

4. Place the horizontal block (b31) above the vertical block, creating the top part of the "R" shape:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

5. Place the vertical block (b13) above the horizontal block, creating the middle part of the "R" shape:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

6. Place the horizontal block (b31) above the middle vertical block, creating the bottom part of the "R" shape:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

7. The structure now resembles the character "R" and meets all the constraints.

Overall, the code would look like this:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b11', 10)

ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)

ab_drop('b31', 9)

ab_drop('b13', 9)

ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

This code generates a stable structure that looks like the character "R" while satisfying all the given constraints.
