To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "X" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function along with the given block types and their shapes.

Here is the approach to generating the "X" structure:

1. Drop a b31 block at slot 9 using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`. This will create a horizontal line in the middle of the structure.

2. Drop a b13 block at slot 4 using `ab_drop('b13', 4)` and another b13 block at slot 14 using `ab_drop('b13', 14)`. This will create the diagonal parts of the "X" structure.

The sequence of dropping the blocks is crucial to ensure stability and meet the constraints. By dropping the blocks in the specified order and position, the resulting structure will resemble the character "X" and satisfy the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is the code to generate the "X" structure:

```
# Map Initialization
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop b31 block at slot 9
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop b13 blocks at slot 4 and slot 14
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```

The resulting structure will be a stable "X" shape that meets all the constraints.
