To generate a stable structure that looks like the "V" shape, we can use the following steps:

1. Start by dropping a b13 block from layer 15 at slot 9, which will represent the tip of the "V".

ab drop(b13, 9, 15)

2. Next, drop two b13 blocks on either side of the center block to start forming the legs of the "V".

ab drop(b13, 7, 14)
ab drop(b13, 11, 14)

3. Now, drop two b31 blocks below the three blocks already in place to widen the structure and make it more stable.

ab drop(b31, 7, 13)
ab drop(b31, 10, 13)

4. Finally, add two b31 blocks at the base to complete the "V" shape and ensure stability.

ab drop(b31, 5, 12)
ab drop(b31, 12, 12)

By following these steps and dropping blocks in the specified positions and order, you can generate a stable structure that resembles the letter "V".
