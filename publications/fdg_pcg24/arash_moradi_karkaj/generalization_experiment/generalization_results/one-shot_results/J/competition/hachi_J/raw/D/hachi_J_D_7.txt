To create a stable structure representing the letter "D" using the `ab_drop()` function, you can follow these steps:

1. Drop a `b31` block at `x_position = 1`.
2. Drop a `b31` block at `x_position = 4`.
3. Drop a `b31` block at `x_position = 5`.
4. Drop a `b31` block at `x_position = 6`.
5. Drop a `b13` block at `x_position = 3`.

The code to accomplish this would be:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
