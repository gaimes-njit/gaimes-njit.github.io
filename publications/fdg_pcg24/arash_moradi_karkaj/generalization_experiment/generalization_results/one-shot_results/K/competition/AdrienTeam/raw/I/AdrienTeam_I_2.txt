Here is one way to use the `ab_drop()` function to create a stable structure resembling "I":

```python
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the first block (b11) at the bottom center
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the second block (b31) above the first block's center
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the third block (b11) above the second block's center
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the fourth block (b31) above the third block's center
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the fifth block (b11) above the fourth block's center
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the sixth block (b31) above the fifth block's center
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the seventh block (b11) above the sixth block's center
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the eighth block (b31) above the seventh block's center
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the ninth block (b11) above the eighth block's center
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the tenth block (b31) above the ninth block's center
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the eleventh block (b11) above the tenth block's center
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the twelfth block (b31) above the eleventh block's center
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the thirteenth block (b11) above the twelfth block's center
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the fourteenth block (b31) above the thirteenth block's center
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the fifteenth block (b11) above the fourteenth block's center
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the sixteenth block (b31) above the fifteenth block's center
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls creates a stable structure resembling the letter "I" with the blocks arranged in a continuous manner. The blocks are positioned according to the given constraints, with the y-coordinate corresponding to the block's center. The blocks are dropped from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15), following the desired shape of the "I".
