The following is an example solution to generate the structure resembling "M" while adhering to the given constraints:

```
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 1: Drop the vertical block at the bottom left to form the left leg of "M"
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Step 2: Drop the horizontal block on top of the vertical block to form the bottom of the "M"
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Step 3: Drop the vertical block on top of the horizontal block to complete the left side of the "M"
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Step 4: Drop the horizontal block on top of the vertical block to form the center of the "M"
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Step 5: Drop the vertical block on top of the horizontal block to complete the right side of the "M"
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Step 6: Drop the horizontal block on top of the vertical block to form the top of the "M"
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Please note that this is just one possible solution. There may be other valid solutions that satisfy the given constraints.
