To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "C", you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the bottom horizontal block (b31) at the center slot (W//2) using `ab_drop('b31', W//2)`. This block will serve as the base of the "C" shape.

3. Next, drop a vertical block (b13) at the slot on top of the base structure to create the vertical stroke of the "C". The slot can be determined by considering the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. For example, you can drop it at the slot (W//2 + 1) if it doesn't intrude the boundary and provides stable support.

4. Drop another horizontal block (b31) at the slot adjacent to the vertical stroke to complete the top stroke of the "C".

5. Finally, drop a square block (b11) at the bottom slot of the vertical stroke to close the "C" shape.

The resulting structure should resemble the uppercase letter "C" while meeting all the hard constraints. Make sure to check stability and perform stability checks before each call to `ab_drop()` function. Additionally, consider variations in the slot selection to generate diverse structures.
