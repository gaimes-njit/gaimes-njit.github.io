Here is an example implementation of the `ab_drop()` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D":

```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type, y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    
    # return the coordinates of the dropped block
    return drop_pos
```

To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D", you can make the following calls to the `ab_drop()` function:

```python
# Drop the first vertical block (b13) at the center slot (W/2)
ab_drop('b13', W/2)

# Drop the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block at one slot to the right
ab_drop('b31', W/2 + 1)

# Drop the second vertical block (b13) on top of the horizontal block at the same slot
ab_drop('b13', W/2 + 1)

# Drop the square block (b11) on top of the second vertical block at the same slot
ab_drop('b11', W/2 + 1)
```

This will result in a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D". You can adjust the position and order of the block drops to meet the stability and shape requirements outlined in the constraints.
