To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "E", we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is an example implementation:

```python
# Definitions
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers

# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Function to check stability
def is_stable(layer, slot):
    if layer == H-1 or structure[layer+1][slot] != ' ':
        return True
    return False

# Function to drop and place a block
def place_block(x, y):
    global structure
    ab_drop(x, y)
    for layer in range(H):
        for slot in range(W):
            if structure[layer][slot] != ' ' and not is_stable(layer, slot):
                structure[layer][slot] = ' '  # Remove unstable blocks

# Drop the first b31 block
place_block('b31', 6)

# Drop the second b31 block
place_block('b31', 5)

# Drop the b13 block
place_block('b13', 5)

# Drop the third b31 block
place_block('b31', 4)

# Drop the fourth b31 block
place_block('b31', 3)

# Drop the fifth b31 block
place_block('b31', 2)

# Drop the sixth b31 block
place_block('b31', 1)

# Drop the b13 block
place_block('b13', 1)

# Drop the seventh b31 block
place_block('b31', 0)
```

In this implementation, we start by dropping the first b31 block centered at slot 6. We then proceed to drop additional blocks to form the structure of the uppercase "E". The `is_stable()` function is used to check the stability of the structure at each block placement, and unstable blocks are removed.

This implementation satisfies the stability constraint by checking stability before each block drop. The resulting structure should resemble the uppercase letter "E" while also considering the constraint of diversity in the generated content.
