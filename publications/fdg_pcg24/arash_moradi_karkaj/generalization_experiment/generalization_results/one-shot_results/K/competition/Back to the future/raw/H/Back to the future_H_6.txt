To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "H" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the given rules and constraints. Here is a possible approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Define a helper function, `check_stability()`, to check the stability of the structure after each drop. This function will check if a block is properly supported and will return True if the structure is stable, and False otherwise.

3. Drop the blocks one by one, following the specific constraints to achieve stability and the shape of "H".

4. First, drop a b13 block at the center of the base layer (layer 0, slot 9):
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

5. Check stability using the `check_stability()` function.

6. Next, drop two b11 blocks to form the vertical lines of the "H" shape (one at slot 6 and another at slot 12):
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 6)
   ab_drop('b11', 12)
   ```

7. Check stability.

8. Then, drop a b31 block at the top of the vertical lines to form the crossbar of the "H" shape (at slot 6):
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 6)
   ```

9. Check stability.

10. Finally, drop two more b11 blocks on top of the crossbar to complete the "H" shape (one at slot 5 and another at slot 7):
    ```python
    ab_drop('b11', 5)
    ab_drop('b11', 7)
    ```

11. Check stability.

12. The structure should now resemble the uppercase character "H".

By following these steps and ensuring stability at each stage, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the letter "H" and meets all the hard constraints.
