To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "K" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically place the blocks on the map.

Here is the algorithm to generate the structure:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Place the first block b31 vertically at the center slot:
   ```python
   y = W // 2  # Center slot
   ab_drop('b31', y)
   ```

3. Place the second block b13 vertically, adjacent to the bottom of the first block:
   ```python
   y1 = y - 1  # Slot to the left
   y2 = y + 1  # Slot to the right
   ab_drop('b13', y1)
   ab_drop('b13', y2)
   ```

4. Place the third block b11 horizontally, on top of the first block, aligned with the center of the structure:
   ```python
   x = H // 2  # Halfway up the structure
   ab_drop('b11', y)
   ```

5. Place the fourth block b11 vertically, on top of the third block:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', y)
   ```

6. Check stability and ensure that the structure is stable before each drop using the provided code. If the structure is unstable, adjust the positions of the blocks as necessary.

7. Continue placing blocks according to the desired shape of the uppercase letter "K", considering stability and meeting the constraints.

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 until the entire structure is built.

By strategically placing the blocks using the `ab_drop()` function and considering stability and constraints, the generated structure will resemble the uppercase character "K" while remaining stable.

Note: The specific positions and sequence of block placements may vary based on the desired shape of the "K" and the constraints. Experimentation and adjustment may be needed to find the optimal placement for stability and resemblance.
