To use the `ab_drop()` function and generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "L", we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided Map Initialization code.

2. Determine the positions and orders for dropping the blocks to create the desired structure. In this case, we need to create an "L" shape using the b11, b13, and b31 blocks.

3. Start by dropping a b11 block at the bottom-left corner of the structure to serve as the base.

4. Drop a b13 block above the b11 block in a stable position. This can be done by checking if the position below the intended drop position is empty or already occupied by a stable block.

5. Drop another b13 block adjacent to the previous one, creating an L shape.

6. Finally, drop a b31 block above the two b13 blocks, completing the L shape.

7. Repeat these steps and make sure to check the stability of the structure before each block drop to ensure that the entire architecture remains stable.

Below is a possible implementation of the steps described above:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Determine drop positions and order
# Drop a b11 block at the bottom-left corner of the structure
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Step 3: Drop a b13 block above the b11 block
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Step 4: Drop another b13 block adjacent to the previous one
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Step 5: Drop a b31 block above the two b13 blocks
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# Step 6: Repeat steps 3-5 to complete the L shape
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# Step 7: Repeat the process for stability and to add more diversity to the structure
# ...

# After completing the above steps, the structure will resemble the uppercase character "L"
```

Note: The code provided above is a basic example implementation and may need to be modified or expanded to handle different scenarios or constraints.
