To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "L" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically place blocks on the structure.

Here is an algorithm that outlines the steps to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the `structure` variable: `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the bottom layer and in the middle slot (slot 9) using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 9)`.

3. Drop a b11 block above the previously dropped block, centered in the middle of the b31 block. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block: `ab_drop('b11', 9)`.

4. Drop another b11 block above the previous one, still centered in the middle of the b31 block. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block: `ab_drop('b11', 9)`.

5. Drop a b31 block above the previous three blocks, centered in the middle of the b31 block. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block: `ab_drop('b31', 9)`.

6. Drop a b11 block above the previous four blocks, centered in the middle of the b31 block. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block: `ab_drop('b11', 9)`.

7. Drop a b13 block above the previous five blocks, centered in the middle of the b31 block. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block: `ab_drop('b13', 9)`.

8. Drop a b13 block above the previous six blocks, centered in the middle of the b31 block. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block: `ab_drop('b13', 9)`.

9. Drop a b11 block above the previous seven blocks, centered in the middle of the b31 block. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block: `ab_drop('b11', 9)`.

10. Drop a b11 block above the previous eight blocks, centered in the middle of the b31 block. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block: `ab_drop('b11', 9)`.

11. Drop a b13 block above the previous nine blocks, centered in the middle of the b31 block. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block: `ab_drop('b13', 9)`.

12. Repeat steps 3-11 to create additional layers of blocks above the initial layer until reaching the desired height of the structure.

13. After generating the entire structure, check if it meets the stability constraint. If not, adjust the positions of the blocks using the `ab_drop()` function to ensure stability.

14. Check if the structure meets the no boundary intrusion constraint. If any blocks are intruding on the boundary, adjust their positions by moving them towards the center of the structure.

15. Finally, check if the overall shape of the structure resembles the uppercase letter "L". If not, adjust the positions of the blocks to better match the desired shape.

By following this algorithm and appropriately using the `ab_drop()` function, you should be able to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "L" and meets all the hard constraints.
