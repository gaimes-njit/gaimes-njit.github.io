To generate a stable structure that resembles the uppercase letter "M", we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the dropping positions for each block type to create the shape of the "M". We will consider the stability and support constraints while determining the dropping positions.

2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks at the calculated positions.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each block type, ensuring that the structure remains stable after each drop.

4. Check if the resulting structure resembles the "M" shape. Adjust the dropping positions if needed.

Here is an example implementation:

```python
# Step 1: Determine dropping positions for each block type

# Calculate dropping positions for b31 blocks
b31_positions = [(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]

# Calculate dropping positions for b13 blocks
b13_positions = [(1, 4), (1, 6)]

# Calculate dropping positions for b11 blocks
b11_positions = [(0, 5)]

# Step 2: Drop the blocks at the calculated positions

# Drop b31 blocks
for pos in b31_positions:
    x, y = pos
    ab_drop('b31', y)

# Drop b13 blocks
for pos in b13_positions:
    x, y = pos
    ab_drop('b13', y)

# Drop b11 blocks
for pos in b11_positions:
    x, y = pos
    ab_drop('b11', y)

# Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 if needed to ensure stability

# ... Repeat steps 1 and 2

# Step 4: Check if the resulting structure resembles the "M" shape

# ... Check the structure and adjust dropping positions if needed
```

You can repeat steps 1 and 2 multiple times, adjusting the positions of the blocks if needed. Additionally, you can add conditions to check stability and support before each `ab_drop()` call to ensure the overall stability of the structure.

Keep in mind that this is just an example implementation, and you may need to modify it based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
