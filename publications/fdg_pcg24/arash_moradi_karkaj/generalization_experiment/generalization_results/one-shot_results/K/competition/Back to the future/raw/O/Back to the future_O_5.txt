To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "O" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at a suitable position in the middle of the structure to act as the base:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # drop a b31 block with center slot at 9
```

3. Follow the block-stacking problem technique to drop the remaining blocks:
```python
# Drop the first layer of vertical b13 blocks around the b31 base to provide stability
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # drop a vertical b13 block with center slot at 7
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # drop a vertical b13 block with center slot at 10

# Drop the second layer of horizontal b31 blocks to form the horizontal part of the "O"
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # drop a b31 block with center slot at 6
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # drop a b31 block with center slot at 11

# Drop the final layer of vertical b13 blocks to complete the "O" shape
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # drop a vertical b13 block with center slot at 7
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # drop a vertical b13 block with center slot at 10
```

4. Ensure stability and meet all the constraints by checking the stability of the structure after each drop and adjust the positions if necessary.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 while considering the constraints and ensuring the generated content is diverse and not always the same.

By following these steps and making necessary adjustments for stability, you can generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "O" and meets all the hard constraints.
