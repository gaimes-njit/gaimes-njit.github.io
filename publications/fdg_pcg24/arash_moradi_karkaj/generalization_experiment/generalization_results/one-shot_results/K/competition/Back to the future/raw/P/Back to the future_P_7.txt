To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "P," we can use the `ab_drop()` function along with the given constraints. Here is the step-by-step process to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. First, we will drop the b31 structure that forms the vertical line of the "P" shape. We need to ensure its stability and support. So we need to check if structure [2,5] has support or not, which means structure [3,4-6] should be stable. If stable, we can drop the b31 structure at [2,5].

3. Next, we will drop the b13 structure that forms the top horizontal line of the "P" shape. We need to ensure its stability and check if it intersects any of the boundaries or existing structures. If stable, we can drop the b13 structure at [4,4].

4. Finally, we will drop the b31 structure that forms the bottom horizontal line of the "P" shape. We need to ensure its stability and check if it intersects any of the boundaries or existing structures. If stable, we can drop the b31 structure at [8,4].

Here is the implementation of the above steps in code:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def check_stability(x, y):
    if x < H-1 and (structure[x+1][y] != ' ' or structure[x+1][y-1] != ' ' or structure[x+1][y+1] != ' '):
        return True
    return False

def check_boundary(x, y):
    if x < H-1:
        if structure[x+1][y] == ' ' and structure[x+1][y-1] == ' ' and structure[x+1][y+1] == ' ':
            return True
    return False

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type, y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Step 1: Drop the b31 structure
# Check if the b31 structure is stable and supported by structure [2,5]
if not check_stability(3, 5):
    # Drop the b31 structure at [2,5]
    ab_drop('b31', 5)

# Step 2: Drop the b13 structure
# Check if the b13 structure is stable and does not intersect the boundaries or existing structures
if check_boundary(1, 4):
    # Drop the b13 structure at [4,4]
    ab_drop('b13', 4)

# Step 3: Drop the b31 structure
# Check if the b31 structure is stable and does not intersect the boundaries or existing structures
if check_boundary(5, 4):
    # Drop the b31 structure at [8,4]
    ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

This implementation ensures that the structure is stable and meets the hard constraints. Additionally, the `check_boundary()` function ensures that the structures do not intrude on the map boundaries. The resulting structure will resemble the uppercase character "P."
