To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Y" and meets all the hard constraints, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the vertical block (b13) at the center slot.
```python
center_slot = W // 2
ab_drop('b13', center_slot)
```

3. Next, drop the horizontal block (b31) above the vertical block, ensuring stability.
```python
ab_drop('b31', center_slot)
```

4. Drop the square block (b11) at the top of the structure, slightly to the right.
```python
top_slot = center_slot + 1
ab_drop('b11', top_slot)
```

5. To complete the upper part of the "Y", drop two additional square blocks above the previous block, forming an inverted "V" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b11', top_slot - 1)
ab_drop('b11', top_slot + 1)
```

By following these steps and ensuring stability at each drop, you will generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Y" and meets all the hard constraints.
