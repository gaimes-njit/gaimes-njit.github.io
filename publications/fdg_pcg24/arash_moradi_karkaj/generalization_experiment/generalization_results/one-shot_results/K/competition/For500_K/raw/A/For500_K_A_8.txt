I will provide an example solution for generating a structure resembling the letter "A" using the ab_drop() function. 

Note: This is just one possible solution and there may be other valid solutions as well.

ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 12)

This solution builds the structure layer by layer, starting from the bottom layer. 

- First, we drop a vertical block 'b13' in the center slot (9) to create the left side of the letter "A". 
- Then, we drop a horizontal block 'b31' on top of the vertical block, with the pivot point also at slot 9. This creates the crossbar of the letter "A". 
- Next, we drop a square block 'b11' on top of the crossbar, again at slot 9. This creates the center part of the letter "A". 
- Finally, we drop two more horizontal blocks 'b31' on either side of the crossbar, with pivot points at slots 6 and 12. This completes the structure resembling the letter "A". 

Again, please note that this is just one possible solution and there may be other valid solutions as well.
