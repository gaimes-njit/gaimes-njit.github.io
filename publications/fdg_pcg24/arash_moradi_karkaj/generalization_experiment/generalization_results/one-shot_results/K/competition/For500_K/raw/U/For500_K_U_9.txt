To generate a stable structure resembling the capital English letter "U" using the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Drop the base of the "U" by using ab_drop('b31', 9). This will create a stable bottom layer.

2. Drop the left side of the "U" by using ab_drop('b13', 2). This will create the left vertical part of the "U".

3. Drop the right side of the "U" by using ab_drop('b13', 16). This will create the right vertical part of the "U".

4. To ensure stability, we can add additional blocks to support the top part of the "U". Drop a supporting block using ab_drop('b13', 9) at the center of the bottom layer.

5. Finally, drop the top part of the "U" by using ab_drop('b31', 9). This will create the curved top part of the "U".

The resulting code using ab_drop() function will be:
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 16)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
