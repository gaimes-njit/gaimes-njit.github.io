To generate the shape resembling the letter "B", we can follow these steps:
1. Initialize the field:
    - Create a 2D array of size 20x16 to represent the field.
    - Set all cells in the field to be unoccupied.

2. Generate the bottom part of the letter "B":
    - Use ab_drop('b31', x) to place a b31 brick on the ground (y=0) at position x.
    - Check if the brick is stable, meaning the number of occupied cells on each side of the pivot (middle cell of the brick) is equal.
    - If the brick is not stable, adjust the x position until it becomes stable.
    - Update the field to mark the occupied cells of the brick.

3. Generate the top part of the letter "B":
    - Use ab_drop('b13', x) to place a b13 brick above the bottom part at position x.
    - Check if the brick is stable.
    - Adjust the x position if needed.
    - Update the field.

4. Adjust the x position of the bottom part if necessary to avoid boundary collisions:
    - If the x position of the bottom part would cause the brick to exceed the boundaries of the field, adjust the x position until it fits.

Here is the code to generate the letter "B":

```
# Initialize the field
field = [[0] * 16 for _ in range(20)]

# Generate the bottom part of the letter "B"
x_position_bottom = 5
ab_drop('b31', x_position_bottom)
while not is_stable('b31', x_position_bottom):
    x_position_bottom -= 1
    ab_drop('b31', x_position_bottom)

# Update the field with the occupied cells of the bottom part
for x in range(x_position_bottom, x_position_bottom + 3):
    for y in range(3):
        field[x][y] = 1

# Generate the top part of the letter "B"
x_position_top = x_position_bottom + 1  # Align the top part with the bottom part
ab_drop('b13', x_position_top)
while not is_stable('b13', x_position_top):
    x_position_top -= 1
    ab_drop('b13', x_position_top)

# Update the field with the occupied cells of the top part
for x in range(x_position_top, x_position_top + 1):
    for y in range(3, 6):
        field[x][y] = 1

# Adjust the x position of the bottom part if necessary to avoid boundary collisions
while x_position_bottom + 3 >= 20:
    x_position_bottom -= 1

# Update the field with the adjusted x position of the bottom part
for x in range(x_position_bottom, x_position_bottom + 3):
    for y in range(3):
        field[x][y] = 1
```

Please note that the function `is_stable(brick_type, x_position)` is not provided. It should be implemented to check the stability of a brick on the field.
