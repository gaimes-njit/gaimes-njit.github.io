To form the letter "G" using the available props, I will need to strategically place the bricks using the ab_drop() function. 

First, I will initialize the field with an empty map.

```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, I will generate the bricks in the following order:
1. Place a b31 brick horizontally at (4, 0).
2. Place a b11 brick at (3, 3), forming the bottom part of the letter "G".
3. Place a b13 brick vertically at (6, 4), forming the tail of the letter "G".

Here's the code that generates the desired structure:

```python
# Initialize field
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check stability of bricks
def check_stability(x, y):
    left_side = sum(field[i][j] for i in range(y+1, 16) for j in range(x, -1, -1))
    right_side = sum(field[i][j] for i in range(y+1, 16) for j in range(x, 20))
    
    if left_side != right_side:
        return False
    return True

# Function to place bricks
def place_brick(brick, x_position):
    ab_drop(brick, x_position)
    for i in range(16):
        for j in range(20):
            if field[i][j] == 1:
                if not check_stability(j, i):
                    field[i-1][j] = 1  # Set the cell above the unstable brick as occupied

# Place the bricks
place_brick('b31', 4)
place_brick('b11', 3)
place_brick('b13', 6)

# Print the field
for row in field[::-1]:
    print(row)
```

The output will be:

```
