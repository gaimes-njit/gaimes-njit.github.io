Sure! Here is the code to generate the shape resembling the letter "J":

```python
# Map initialization
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check stability of the bricks
def check_stability():
    for y in range(1, 16):
        for x in range(1, 19):
            if field[y][x] == 1:
                if field[y-1][x] != 1 and field[y][x-1] != 1 and field[y][x+1] != 1:
                    return False
    return True

# Place the first brick b31
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Place the second brick b13
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Place the third brick b11
ab_drop('b11', 7)

# Checking stability after placing the bricks
if not check_stability():
    print("Structure is unstable")

# Printing the final field
for row in field:
    print(row)
```

Explanation:
1. I initialized the field with a 2D list of zeros representing empty cells.
2. The function `check_stability` checks if the structure is stable by iterating through the cells and checking if any brick is unsupported. If an unsupported brick is found, it returns `False`.
3. I placed the bricks in the specified order using the `ab_drop` function.
4. After placing the bricks, I checked the stability of the structure. If the structure is unstable, a message is printed.
5. Finally, I printed the final field to visualize the placement of bricks.

Please note that the code provided is a basic implementation to generate the required structure. You can further optimize and modify the code based on your specific requirements.
