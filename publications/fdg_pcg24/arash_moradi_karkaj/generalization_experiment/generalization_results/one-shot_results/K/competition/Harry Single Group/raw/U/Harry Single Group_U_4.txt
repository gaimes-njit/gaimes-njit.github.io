To form a shape resembling the letter "U", we can use a combination of b31 and b13 bricks. 

We will start by initializing the field and creating two b13 bricks at the bottom corners of the field to act as supports for the U shape.

```python
# Map Initialization
def init_map():
    for y in range(16):
        for x in range(20):
            # Set all cells as empty
            ab_drop('b11', x)
```

Next, we will place the b31 bricks to form the sides of the U shape. To ensure stability, we will avoid placing any cells on the sides of the bottom b13 bricks, which act as the pivot for the U shape.

```python
# Placing b31 bricks
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Left side of U
ab_drop('b31', 16)  # Right side of U
```

To complete the U shape, we will place a b13 brick on top of each b31 brick, making sure to align them with the sides of the U shape.

```python
# Placing b13 bricks on top
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Left side of U
ab_drop('b13', 16)  # Right side of U
```

The final code looks like this:

```python
# Map Initialization
def init_map():
    for y in range(16):
        for x in range(20):
            # Set all cells as empty
            ab_drop('b11', x)
            
# Placing bricks to form the U shape
ab_drop('b13', 0)   # Bottom left corner
ab_drop('b13', 19)  # Bottom right corner

ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Left side of U
ab_drop('b31', 16)  # Right side of U

ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Left side of U
ab_drop('b13', 16)  # Right side of U
```

Executing the code will generate a shape resembling the letter "U" using the given bricks.
