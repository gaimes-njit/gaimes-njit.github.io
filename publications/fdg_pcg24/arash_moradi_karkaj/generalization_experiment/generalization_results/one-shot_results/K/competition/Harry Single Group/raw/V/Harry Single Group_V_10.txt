To form the shape resembling the letter "V" using the available bricks and the ab_drop() function, we need to strategically place the bricks in a stable manner. 

Here is one way to generate the required structure:

```python
# Map initialization
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check if a position is within the boundaries of the field
def within_boundaries(x, y):
    return 0 <= x < 20 and 0 <= y < 16

# Function to check if a position is occupied by a brick
def is_occupied(x, y):
    return field[y][x] != 0

# Function to check the stability of the bricks
def is_stable():
    for y in range(1, 16):
        for x in range(20):
            if field[y][x] != 0:
                # Check left side stability
                left_count = 0
                for i in range(x):
                    if field[y][i] != 0:
                        left_count += 1
                # Check right side stability
                right_count = 0
                for i in range(x + 1, 20):
                    if field[y][i] != 0:
                        right_count += 1
                # If the difference in occupied cells on the left and right sides is more than 1, the structure is unstable
                if abs(left_count - right_count) > 1:
                    return False
    return True

# Function to drop a brick on the field
def ab_drop(x, y):
    if x == 'b13':
        # Drop a vertical rectangular brick (b13)
        for i in range(y, y + 3):
            if within_boundaries(i, 0) and not is_occupied(i, 0):
                field[0][i] = 1
    elif x == 'b31':
        # Drop a horizontal rectangular brick (b31)
        for i in range(y - 1, y + 2):
            if within_boundaries(i, 0) and not is_occupied(i, 0):
                field[0][i] = 2
    elif x == 'b11':
        # Drop a square brick (b11)
        if within_boundaries(y, 0) and not is_occupied(y, 0):
            field[0][y] = 3

# Generate the required structure (letter "V")

# Step 1: Place the b31 brick to form the top of the "V"
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Step 2: Place the b13 brick on the left side of the "V"
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Step 3: Place the b13 brick on the right side of the "V"
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Check the stability of the structure
if is_stable():
    print("The structure is stable!")
else:
    print("The structure is unstable!")

# Visualize the field
for row in field:
    print(row)
```

Output:
```
The structure is stable!
