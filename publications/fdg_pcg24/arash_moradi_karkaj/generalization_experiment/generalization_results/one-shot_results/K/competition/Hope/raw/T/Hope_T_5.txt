To create the structure exactly like "T" inside a 20*16 box using the ab_drop() command, you can follow these steps:

1. Drop the first vertical line of the "T":
   - Use ab_drop('b13', 9) to drop a 1x3 block at position (9,0).

2. Drop the horizontal line of the "T":
   - Use ab_drop('b31', 5) to drop a 3x1 block at position (5,1).

3. Drop the second vertical line of the "T":
   - Use ab_drop('b13', 9) to drop a 1x3 block at position (9,2).

The final structure would look like this:

```
--------------------
|                  |
|        █         |
|        █         |
|       ███        |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
--------------------
```

Note: The "█" character represents the blocks dropped using the ab_drop() command.
