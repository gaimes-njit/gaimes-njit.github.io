To generate the uppercase letter "F", we need to carefully place the block types in the Tetris-like environment. Here is a sequence of ab_drop() commands that will create the letter "F":

ab_drop('b31',1)    # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',3)    # Place the first vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',2)    # Place the second vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)    # Place the horizontal block at position 2

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "F" in the defined environment.
