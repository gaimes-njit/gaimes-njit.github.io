To generate the uppercase letter "A" using the given ab_drop() command and block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two b11 blocks at positions 4 and 6 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

2. Place a b31 block at position 5 to form the top of the letter "A":
```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

3. Next, place two b11 blocks at positions 4 and 5, and another b31 block at position 5 to form the middle part of the letter "A":
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

4. Finally, place two b11 blocks at positions 4 and 6 to complete the bottom part of the letter "A":
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

The complete sequence of commands to generate the uppercase letter "A" will be:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

Make sure to execute these commands consecutively to accurately represent the letter "A" within the allowed space boundaries.
