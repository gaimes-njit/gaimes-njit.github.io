To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we need to carefully place the block types in order to form the desired shape. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to achieve this:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Place a 1x1 square block at position 8
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Place a 1x1 square block at position 9
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Place a 1x1 square block at position 10
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 9
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 11
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 5
```

When executed in order, these commands will create an uppercase letter "A" within the defined environment, satisfying the gravity rules.
