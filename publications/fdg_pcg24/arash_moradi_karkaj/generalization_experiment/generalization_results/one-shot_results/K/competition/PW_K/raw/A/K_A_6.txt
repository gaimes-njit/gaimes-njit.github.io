To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we can use a combination of block types b11 and b31. Here is a possible stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place a 1x1 block at position (4,1)
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place a 1x1 block at position (5,1)
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place a 1x1 block at position (6,1)
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place a 3x1 block at position (5,2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place a 3x1 block at position (5,3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place a 1x1 block at position (4,4)
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place a 1x1 block at position (6,4)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "A" in the defined environment while maintaining stacking and stability.
