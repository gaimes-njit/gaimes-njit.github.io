To generate the uppercase letter "B", we can break it down into four block types:

1. The first block type is `b11`, which represents a 1x1 square block. We will use this block to create the top and bottom horizontal bars of the letter "B".

2. The second block type is `b31`, which represents a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit. We will use this block to create the middle horizontal bar of the letter "B".

3. The third block type is `b13`, which represents a vertical straight block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units. We will use this block to create the two vertical bars of the letter "B".

4. The fourth block type is an empty space represented by `b00`. We will use this to leave gaps in between the blocks where necessary.

To generate the letter "B" using the `ab_drop()` command, follow the steps below:

1. Start by placing a `b11` block at position `(4, 1)` using the command `ab_drop('b11', 4)`.

2. Place another `b11` block at position `(6, 1)` using the command `ab_drop('b11', 6)`.

3. Create the middle horizontal bar by placing a `b31` block at position `(5, 1)` using the command `ab_drop('b31', 5)`.

4. Create the two vertical bars by placing a `b13` block at position `(4, 2)` using the command `ab_drop('b13', 4)`.

5. Place another `b13` block at position `(4, 4)` to complete the vertical bars.

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "B" would be:

```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```
