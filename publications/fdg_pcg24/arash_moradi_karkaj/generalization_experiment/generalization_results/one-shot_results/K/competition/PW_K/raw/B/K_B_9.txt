To generate the uppercase letter "B," you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a 1x1 square block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place a 1x1 square block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Place a 1x1 square block at position 8
ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 8
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "B" in the defined Tetris-like environment with the given block types and gravity rules.
