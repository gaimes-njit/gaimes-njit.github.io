To create the uppercase English letter "C" using the given block types and gravity rules, you can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b11',1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
```

These commands will create the uppercase letter "C" within the boundaries of the grid and maintain stability according to the gravity rules.
