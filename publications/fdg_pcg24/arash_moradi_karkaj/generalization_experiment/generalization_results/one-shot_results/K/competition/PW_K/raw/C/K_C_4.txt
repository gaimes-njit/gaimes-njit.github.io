To generate the uppercase letter "C" using the given block types and environment, we can follow the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

This set of commands will stack the blocks in a way that resembles the letter "C" within the allowed space and follows the gravity rules.
