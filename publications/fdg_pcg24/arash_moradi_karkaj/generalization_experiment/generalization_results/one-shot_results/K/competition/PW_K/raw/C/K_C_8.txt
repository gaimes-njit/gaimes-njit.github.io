To generate the uppercase English letter "C", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b13',8)
ab_drop('b31',10)
```

Explanation:
- The first command places a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2. This forms the top part of the letter "C".
- The next three commands place vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 4, 6, and 8. These form the middle part of the letter "C".
- The last command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 10. This completes the bottom part of the letter "C".

Please note that the X positions in the commands above are based on the indexing system mentioned in the instructions. Adjust the X positions if necessary to match the indexing system used in your programming environment.
