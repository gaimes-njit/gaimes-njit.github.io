To generate the uppercase letter "D" using the given block types and environment, you can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 10
ab_drop('b31', 13)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 13
ab_drop('b13', 16)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 16
ab_drop('b13', 16)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 16
```

By executing these commands consecutively, you will be able to generate the uppercase letter "D" within the specified boundaries and according to the gravity rules.
