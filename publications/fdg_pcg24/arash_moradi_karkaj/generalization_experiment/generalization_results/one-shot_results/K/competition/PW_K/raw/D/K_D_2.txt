To generate the uppercase English letter "D", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

This will result in the letter "D" being constructed in the defined environment, following the gravity rules.
