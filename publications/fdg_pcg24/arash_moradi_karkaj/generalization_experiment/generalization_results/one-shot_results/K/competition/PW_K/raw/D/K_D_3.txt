To generate the uppercase letter "D", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Place a single square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place another single square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place another single square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place another single square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)   # Place another single square block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 6)   # Place another single square block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 7)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 8)   # Place another vertical straight block at position 8
ab_drop('b13', 9)   # Place another vertical straight block at position 9
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 10
ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 11
ab_drop('b13', 12)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 12
ab_drop('b31', 9)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 9
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 10
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 11
ab_drop('b31', 12)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 12
ab_drop('b31', 13)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 13
ab_drop('b31', 14)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 14
ab_drop('b31', 15)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 15

This sequence of commands will create a stable and accurate representation of the letter "D" using the specified block types and within the allowed space boundaries.
