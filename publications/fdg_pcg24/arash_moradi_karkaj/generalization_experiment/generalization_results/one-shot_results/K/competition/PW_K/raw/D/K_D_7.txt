To generate the uppercase letter "D", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1) # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',4) # Place the vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13',1) # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',5) # Place the vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b31',6) # Place the horizontal straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b11',1) # Place the square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',6) # Place the square block at position 6
```

This set of commands will create the uppercase "D" letter in the defined environment, while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
