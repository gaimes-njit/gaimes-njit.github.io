To generate the uppercase letter "E" using the block types in the defined environment, we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place the third horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',1)  # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',1)  # Place the second vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',1)  # Place the third vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',1)  # Place the fourth vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',3)  # Place the fifth vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',3)  # Place the sixth vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',3)  # Place the seventh vertical block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "E" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
