To generate the uppercase letter "F" in the given environment, we can use the following stream of commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)   # Place the second vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',1)   # Place the third vertical block at position 1
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "F" in the Tetris-like environment.
