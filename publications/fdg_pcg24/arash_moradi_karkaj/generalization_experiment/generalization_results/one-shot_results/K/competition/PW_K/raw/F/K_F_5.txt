To generate the uppercase English letter "F", you can use the following stream of commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Place the second vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Place the third vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Place the horizontal straight block at the top
```

This will create a stable "F" letter shape within the allowed boundaries.
