To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
```

Explanation:

1. The first command `ab_drop('b13',1)` places a vertical straight block at position 1, creating the left vertical line of the letter "F".
2. The second command `ab_drop('b31',1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1, connecting to the bottom of the vertical line and forming the horizontal line of the letter "F".
3. The third command `ab_drop('b11',2)` places a square block at position 2, filling the space between the vertical and horizontal lines.
4. The last three commands `ab_drop('b11',1)` place square blocks at position 1, extending the vertical line downwards.

By following these commands, you will be able to generate the uppercase letter "F" within the defined environment.
