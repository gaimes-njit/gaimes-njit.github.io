To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b11',1)   # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place a square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)   # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',3)   # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',1)   # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place a square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)   # Place a square block at position 3
```

These commands will construct the letter "F" in the given environment, maintaining stacking and stability.
