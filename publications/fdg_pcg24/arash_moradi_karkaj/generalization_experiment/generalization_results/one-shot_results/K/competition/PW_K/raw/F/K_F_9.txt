To generate the letter "F" using the given block types, we will follow these steps:

1. Place two square blocks ('b11') vertically to form the first two vertical lines of the letter "F" in the leftmost column:
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)

2. Place a horizontal block ('b31') starting from the second column to connect the top and bottom lines of the letter "F":
ab_drop('b31', 2)

3. Place two square blocks ('b11') vertically in the second column to complete the letter "F":
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)

Here is the complete sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Following these commands will generate the uppercase English letter "F" in the defined environment.
