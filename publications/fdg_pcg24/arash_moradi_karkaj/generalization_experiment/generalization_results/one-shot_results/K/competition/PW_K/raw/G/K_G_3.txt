To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b31 block at position 1 to form the top horizontal line of the letter.
2. Place a b11 block at position 2 to form the top-right dot of the letter.
3. Place a b11 block at position 3 to form the middle-right dot of the letter.
4. Place a b11 block at position 4 to form the bottom-right dot of the letter.
5. Place a b31 block at position 5 to form the middle horizontal line of the letter.
6. Place a b13 block at position 5 to form the vertical line of the letter.
7. Place a b13 block at position 8 to complete the vertical line of the letter.
