To generate the uppercase English letter "H", we can use the following commands:

``` python
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 9
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 8
```
