To generate the uppercase English letter "I" using the ab_drop() commands and the given block types, follow these steps:

1. Place two square blocks (b11) vertically, with a distance of 2 units between them:
```
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) below the two square blocks, centered between them:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

3. Place two square blocks (b11) vertically below the horizontal straight block, with a distance of 2 units between them:
```
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
```

4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) below the two square blocks, centered between them:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

5. Place two square blocks (b11) vertically below the horizontal straight block, with a distance of 2 units between them:
```
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
```

The final configuration of blocks should resemble the letter "I" when viewed in the defined environment.
