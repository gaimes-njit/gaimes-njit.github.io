To generate the uppercase letter "I", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation:
- First, we drop a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 to create the top part of the "I" letter.
- Then, we drop three square blocks ('b11') at position 2 to create the vertical line of the "I" letter.
- Finally, we drop another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 to complete the bottom part of the "I" letter.

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "I" with the given block types and within the defined environment.
