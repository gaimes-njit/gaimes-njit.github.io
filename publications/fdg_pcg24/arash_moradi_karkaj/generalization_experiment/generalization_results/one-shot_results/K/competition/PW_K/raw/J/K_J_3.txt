To generate the uppercase English letter "J" in the given environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place a square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place another square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)   # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',4)   # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11',5)   # Place a square block at position 5
```

These commands will create the letter "J" in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
