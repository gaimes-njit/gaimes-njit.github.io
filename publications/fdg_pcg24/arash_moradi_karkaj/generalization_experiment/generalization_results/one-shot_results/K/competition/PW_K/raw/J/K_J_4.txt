To generate the uppercase English letter "J" using the block types and environment provided, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place vertical straight block below previous block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place square block to the right of previous blocks at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place square block to the right of previous blocks at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place square block to the right of previous blocks at position 5
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "J" within the defined environment and gravity rules.
