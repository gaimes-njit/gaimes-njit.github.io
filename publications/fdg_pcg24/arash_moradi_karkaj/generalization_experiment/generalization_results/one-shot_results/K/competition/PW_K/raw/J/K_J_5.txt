To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',5)
ab_drop('b11',6)
```

These commands will place the block types in the defined environment to form the letter "J" shape. The blocks are placed consecutively from left to right, following the gravity rules to ensure structural stability.
