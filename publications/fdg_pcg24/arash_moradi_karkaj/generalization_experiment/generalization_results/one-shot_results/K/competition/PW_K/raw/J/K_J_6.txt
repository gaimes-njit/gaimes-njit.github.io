To generate the uppercase letter "J" using the provided block types and gravity rules, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the first block (b13) at position (1, 4). This will be the vertical stem of the letter "J".
2. Place the second block (b31) at position (3, 5). This will be the horizontal arm of the letter "J".
3. Place two more blocks (b11) at positions (2, 4) and (2, 6) to complete the letter "J" shape.

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "J":

```
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',5)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',6)
```

By following these commands, the blocks will stack on top of each other and form the uppercase letter "J" within the boundaries of the allowed space.
