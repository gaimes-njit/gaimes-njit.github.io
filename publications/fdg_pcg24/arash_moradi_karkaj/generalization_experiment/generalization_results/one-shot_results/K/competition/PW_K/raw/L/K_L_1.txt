To generate the uppercase letter "L", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',5)
ab_drop('b11',5)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the commands:

1. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 4.
3. Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
4. Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
5. Place a 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 5.
6. Place another 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 5.
7. Place another 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 5.

By following these commands, the blocks will stack up and form the shape of the uppercase letter "L" within the allowed boundaries of the grid.
