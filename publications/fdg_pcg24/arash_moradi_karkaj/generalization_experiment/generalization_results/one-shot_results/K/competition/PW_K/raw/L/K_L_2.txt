To generate the uppercase English letter "L", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

Here's a breakdown of the commands:

1. The first three commands (`ab_drop('b13',1)`) place three vertical straight blocks next to each other at position 1 along the width. This creates the vertical line of the letter "L".

2. The fourth command (`ab_drop('b31',3)`) places a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units at position 3 along the width. This creates the horizontal line of the letter "L", completing the letter.
