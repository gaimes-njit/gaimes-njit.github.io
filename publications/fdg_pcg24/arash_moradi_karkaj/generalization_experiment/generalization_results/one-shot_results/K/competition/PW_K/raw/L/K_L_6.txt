To generate the uppercase English letter "L," you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "L" by stacking the blocks in the specified positions while maintaining stability according to the gravity rules.
