To generate the uppercase letter "L" using the given command and block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Place a b31 block at position 1.
2. Place a b13 block at position 4, just below the b31 block.
3. Place a b11 block at position 1, just below the b13 block.
4. Place a b11 block at position 1, just below the previous b11 block.
5. Place a b11 block at position 1, just below the previous b11 block.
6. Place a b11 block at position 1, just below the previous b11 block.
7. Place a b11 block at position 1, just below the previous b11 block.
8. Place a b11 block at position 1, just below the previous b11 block.

The stream of commands would look like this:
```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "L" within the defined boundaries and follow the gravity rules.
