To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by dropping a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
2. Drop a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 4.
3. Place a 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 1.
4. Continue by placing two more 1x1 square blocks ('b11') at positions 4 and 7, forming the vertical part of the letter "L".

The resulting shape will resemble the uppercase letter "L" within the defined boundaries of the grid.
