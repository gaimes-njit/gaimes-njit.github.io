To generate the uppercase letter "M", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 3

This sequence of commands will create the letter "M" in the Tetris-like environment.
