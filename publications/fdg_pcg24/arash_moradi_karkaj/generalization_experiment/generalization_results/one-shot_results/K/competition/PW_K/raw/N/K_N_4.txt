To generate the uppercase letter "N" using the ab_drop() command and the provided block types in the defined environment, you can follow the sequence of commands below:

``` 
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',7)
ab_drop('b11',10)
ab_drop('b11',12)
ab_drop('b31',13)
ab_drop('b13',16)
ab_drop('b31',19)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "N" by stacking and arranging the blocks according to the defined rules of gravity and within the specified boundaries of the environment.
