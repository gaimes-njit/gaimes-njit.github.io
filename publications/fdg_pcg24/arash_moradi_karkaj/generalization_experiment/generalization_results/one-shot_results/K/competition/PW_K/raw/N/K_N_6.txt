To create the uppercase letter "N", we can break it down into three parts: the left vertical line, the middle diagonal line, and the right vertical line. 

Here is the stream of commands to create the letter "N":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the first block of the left vertical line at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place the second block of the left vertical line at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place the third block of the left vertical line at position 3
ab_drop('b31',4)   # Place the first block of the middle diagonal line at position 4
ab_drop('b31',5)   # Place the second block of the middle diagonal line at position 5
ab_drop('b31',6)   # Place the third block of the middle diagonal line at position 6
ab_drop('b13',7)   # Place the first block of the right vertical line at position 7
ab_drop('b13',8)   # Place the second block of the right vertical line at position 8
ab_drop('b13',9)   # Place the third block of the right vertical line at position 9
```

These commands will create the letter "N" using the block types and following the 2D gravity rules.
