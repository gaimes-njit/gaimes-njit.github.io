To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use a combination of blocks b11, b31, and b13. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "N":

ab_drop('b31', 1) // Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 4) // Place the vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7) // Place the horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop('b11', 11) // Place the square block at position 11
ab_drop('b31', 14) // Place the horizontal block at position 14

Please note that the positions mentioned in the commands are just for reference and may need adjustments according to the actual grid.
