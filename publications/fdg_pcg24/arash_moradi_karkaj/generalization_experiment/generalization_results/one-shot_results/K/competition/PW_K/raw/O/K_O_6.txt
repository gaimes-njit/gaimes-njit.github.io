In order to generate the uppercase English letter "O", we will use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "O" in the defined environment, with the blocks arranged in a stacked and stable manner.
