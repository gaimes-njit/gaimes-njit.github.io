To generate the uppercase English letter "P", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block starting from position 1.
- The next three commands `ab_drop('b11', 1)`, `ab_drop('b11', 2)`, and `ab_drop('b11', 3)` place three square blocks right next to each other, forming the top part of the letter "P".
- The last command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places a vertical straight block in the middle of the three square blocks, completing the letter "P".

Please note that these commands assume the grid is empty before executing them. Adjust the position indices accordingly if there are existing blocks in the grid.
