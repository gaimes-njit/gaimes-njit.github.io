To create the uppercase letter "P", we'll start with a vertical straight block (b13) and then add a horizontal straight block (b31) next to it. Here are the commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b11',4)
```

Please ensure that these commands are executed consecutively, one after the other.
