To generate the uppercase letter "Q", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b31',4)` places a horizontal straight block starting from position 4. This forms the top part of the letter "Q".
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13',4)` places a vertical straight block starting from position 4. This extends the left side of the letter "Q".
3. The third command `ab_drop('b13',6)` places another vertical straight block starting from position 6. This extends the right side of the letter "Q".
4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b13',4)` places another vertical straight block starting from position 4. This completes the bottom part of the letter "Q".

By following these commands in consecutive order, you'll be able to generate the uppercase letter "Q" in the defined environment.
