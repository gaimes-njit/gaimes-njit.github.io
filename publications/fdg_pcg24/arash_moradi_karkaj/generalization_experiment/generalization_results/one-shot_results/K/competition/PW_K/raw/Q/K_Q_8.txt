To generate the uppercase letter "Q" in the given environment, we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block (width 3) at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place a square block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place a square block at position 6
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place a horizontal straight block (width 3) at position 7
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place a square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place a square block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place a vertical straight block (height 3) at position 7
```

These commands will construct the uppercase letter "Q" within the allowed space boundaries, ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
