To generate the uppercase letter "R", we can break it down into three parts: the vertical line, the diagonal line, and the horizontal line. 

First, we will create the vertical line using the `b13` block type. We will start from the top and go down to the bottom, placing two blocks in the same column. 

Next, we will create the diagonal line using the `b31` block type. We will start from the top-left corner and go down to the bottom-right corner, placing three blocks consecutively along the diagonal. 

Finally, we will create the horizontal line using the `b31` block type. We will start from the bottom-left corner and go to the right, placing three blocks consecutively along the bottom row. 

Here is the sequence of `ab_drop()` commands to generate the letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 15)
```

Please note that the vertical line is created by placing two `b13` blocks in the same column, the diagonal line is created by placing three `b31` blocks along the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right, and the horizontal line is created by placing three `b31` blocks along the bottom row.

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively and ensure that the blocks stack properly according to the gravity rules.
