To create the uppercase letter "S" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start at position 1,1 and place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1. This will form the left side of the letter "S".

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

2. Move to position 2 and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2. This will form the upper part of the letter "S".

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

3. Move to position 3 and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3. This will form the middle part of the letter "S".

```
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

4. Move to position 4 and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4. This will form the lower part of the letter "S".

```
ab_drop('b31',4)
```

5. Move to position 5 and place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 5. This will form the right side of the letter "S".

```
ab_drop('b13',5)
```

6. Move to position 6 and place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 6. This will form the bottom part of the letter "S".

```
ab_drop('b31',6)
```

Putting it all together, the sequence of commands to generate the letter "S" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b31',6)
```

This will create the uppercase letter "S" in the Tetris-like environment with the given block types and gravity rules.
