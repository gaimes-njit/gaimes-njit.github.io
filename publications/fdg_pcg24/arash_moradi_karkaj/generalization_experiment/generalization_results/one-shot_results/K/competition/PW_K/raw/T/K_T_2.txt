To create the uppercase English letter "T," you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',2) ab_drop('b13',2) ab_drop('b11',3) ab_drop('b11',2) ab_drop('b11',1)
```

This will create a horizontal straight block, followed by a vertical straight block, and then three square blocks stacked vertically. The final result will resemble the letter "T."

Remember to input the commands consecutively between the three backticks (```).
