To generate the uppercase English letter "T," you can use the following series of `ab_drop()` commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place the square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place the square block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place the square block at position 6
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Place the square block at position 7
```

This series of commands will create the uppercase letter "T" within the allowed space boundaries.
