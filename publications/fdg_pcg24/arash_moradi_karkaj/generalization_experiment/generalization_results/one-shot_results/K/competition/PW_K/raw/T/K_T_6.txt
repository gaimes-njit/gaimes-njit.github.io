To generate the uppercase English letter "T", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by dropping a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 5.
2. Then, we drop a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 5, which intersects with the previous block to form the vertical stem of the "T".
3. Next, we drop two square blocks (`b11`) at positions 4 and 6, which form the horizontal stroke of the "T".

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase English letter "T" within the allowed space boundaries and follow the gravity rules.
