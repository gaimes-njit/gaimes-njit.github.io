To generate the uppercase letter "T", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place the horizontal block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Place the vertical block on top of the horizontal block
ab_drop('b11', 9)   # Place a square block on the left side
ab_drop('b11', 11)  # Place another square block on the right side

This sequence of commands will create a stable and accurate representation of the letter "T" within the grid boundaries.
