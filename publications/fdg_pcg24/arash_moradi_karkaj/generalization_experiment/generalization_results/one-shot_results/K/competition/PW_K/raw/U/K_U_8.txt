To create the uppercase letter "U", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1) ab_drop('b11',3) ab_drop('b11',4) ab_drop('b11',5) ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b31',7)
```

Explanation:
1. First, we drop a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2 to create the top part of the "U".
2. Then, we drop a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1, followed by three square blocks ('b11') at positions 3, 4, and 5 to create the left side of the "U".
3. Next, we drop another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 6 to complete the left side of the "U".
4. Finally, we drop a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 7 to create the bottom part of the "U".

By following these commands, we can construct the uppercase letter "U" while ensuring structural stability within the defined environment.
