To create the uppercase letter "V", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place another vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 6)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 6
```

By executing these commands consecutively, the uppercase letter "V" will be formed within the defined grid space.
