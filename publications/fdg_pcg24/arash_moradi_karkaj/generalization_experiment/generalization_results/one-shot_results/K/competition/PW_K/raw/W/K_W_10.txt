To generate the uppercase letter "W", we can use a combination of block types b11, b31, and b13. Here is a stream of ab_drop() commands that resemble the target letter:

``` 
ab_drop('b31', 1)     # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 3)     # Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)     # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 5)     # Place a vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 4)     # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 6)     # Place a horizontal straight block at position 6
```

This series of commands will construct the uppercase letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries.
