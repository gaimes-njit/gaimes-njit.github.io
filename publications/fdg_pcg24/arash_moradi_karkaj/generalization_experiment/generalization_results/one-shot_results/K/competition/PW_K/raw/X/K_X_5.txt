To generate the uppercase letter "X", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the third horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place the second vertical block at position 6
```

This will create the letter "X" using the specified block types and follow the gravity rules in the defined environment.
