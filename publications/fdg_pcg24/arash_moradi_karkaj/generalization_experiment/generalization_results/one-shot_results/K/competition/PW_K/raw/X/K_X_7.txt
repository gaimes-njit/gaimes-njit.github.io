To generate the uppercase letter "X" using the ab_drop() command and the provided block types, follow these steps:

1. Place the first square block at position (4,1). This represents the top left corner of the letter "X".
2. Place the second square block at position (6,1). This represents the top right corner of the letter "X".
3. Place the horizontal straight block at position (5,1). This connects the two square blocks at the top.
4. Place the third square block at position (4,2). This represents the bottom left corner of the letter "X".
5. Place the fourth square block at position (5,2). This represents the center of the letter "X".
6. Place the horizontal straight block at position (5,2). This connects the bottom left and center square blocks.
7. Place the fifth square block at position (4,3). This represents the bottom left corner of the letter "X".
8. Place the sixth square block at position (6,3). This represents the bottom right corner of the letter "X".

The stream of ab_drop() commands would be:
```
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',6)
ab_drop('b31',5)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',5)
ab_drop('b31',5)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',6)
```
