To generate the uppercase English letter "Y" using the given block types and the defined environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "Y" within the defined grid boundaries, starting from the X position 1. By placing the blocks in this order and position, the letter "Y" can be accurately represented while maintaining stability based on the gravity rules.
