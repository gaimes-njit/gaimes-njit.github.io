To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", we will need to use a combination of block types b11, b31, and b13. 

Here is a possible sequence of ab_drop() commands to construct the letter "Y":

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at the first position
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block at the second position
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the horizontal straight block at the third position
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the square block above the middle position of the horizontal straight blocks
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block next to the square block
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the vertical straight block next to the other side of the square block

The sequence of commands should resemble the uppercase English letter "Y" in the defined environment.
