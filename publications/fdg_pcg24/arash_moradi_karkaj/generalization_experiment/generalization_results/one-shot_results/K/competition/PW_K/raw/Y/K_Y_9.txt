To generate the uppercase letter Y, we can use the following commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing two horizontal straight blocks (b31) at position 4 to create the top arms of the Y.
- Next, we place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 5 and 6 to create the center stem of the Y.
- Finally, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at positions 4 and 6 to create the bottom arms of the Y.

This sequence of commands will generate a stable and accurate representation of the uppercase letter Y within the defined environment.
