To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1) ab_drop('b11',4) ab_drop('b11',5) ab_drop('b31',4) ab_drop('b11',7)
```

Explanation:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 along the width.
2. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 4.
3. Place another 1x1 square block (b11) at position 5.
4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4.
5. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 7.

These commands will create a stable "Z" shape within the allowed space boundaries.
