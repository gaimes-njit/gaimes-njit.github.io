To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```  
ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Place a 1x1 square block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place a 1x1 square block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place a 1x1 square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place a 1x1 square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)   # Place a 1x1 square block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 5)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 5
```

This sequence of commands will accurately represent and fit the uppercase English letter "Z" within the allowed space boundaries.
