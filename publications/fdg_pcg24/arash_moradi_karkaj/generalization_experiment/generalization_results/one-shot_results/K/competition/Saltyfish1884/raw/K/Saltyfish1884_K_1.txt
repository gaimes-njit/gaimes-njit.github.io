To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K" while meeting all hard constraints, the following steps can be followed:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base of the structure using the ab_drop() function. The base can be formed by placing a b11 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and the appropriate slot number:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Place the base at slot number 7
```

Step 3: Place the vertical part of the "K" structure using the ab_drop() function. This can be done by placing two b13 blocks vertically on top of the base, aligned with the center slot number:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place the first vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place the second vertical block
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal part of the "K" structure using the ab_drop() function. This can be done by placing a b31 block horizontally on top of the vertical blocks, aligned with the center slot number:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the horizontal block on top
```

Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 to add symmetry to the horizontal part of the "K" structure:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the first vertical block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place the second vertical block on the right side
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the horizontal block on top again
```

Step 6: The final structure should now resemble the character "K". You can print the structure to verify the result:

```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This structure should meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints, as the blocks are placed in a stable manner and do not intrude on the map's boundaries.
