To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K" using the ab_drop() function and meet all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code snippet:

```
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Next, let's define the placement rules for each block type based on the stability constraints:
   - b11 (square block): Can be placed anywhere on the structure.
   - b31 (horizontal block): Must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Should be placed as low as possible.
   - b13 (vertical block): Can be placed anywhere on the structure.
   
3. To achieve stability, we need to carefully determine the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Since the structure should resemble the character "K", let's consider how each block can contribute to forming the shape.

4. Based on the shape of "K", we can start by placing a b31 block horizontally on the bottom layer (layer 0). This will form the base of the structure. The dropping position of this block should be centered on the structure, so let's set `y` to `W // 2 - 1` in the ab_drop() function.

5. Next, we can place two b13 blocks vertically on top of the b31 block, each centered on one side. The dropping positions for these blocks should be `y = W // 2 - 2` and `y = W // 2`.

6. Finally, we can place two b11 blocks on top of the b31 block, one centered on the left side and the other centered on the right side. The dropping positions for these blocks should be `y = W // 2 - 1` and `y = W // 2 + 1`.

7. We can use the ab_drop() function to drop each block at its respective dropping position. The final structure will resemble the character "K" while meeting the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here's an example implementation of the given approach:

```python
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x


# Place the b31 block (horizontal) at the bottom layer
ab_drop('b31', W // 2 - 1)

# Place two b13 blocks (vertical) on top of the b31 block
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 - 2)
ab_drop('b13', W // 2)

# Place two b11 blocks (square) on top of the b31 block
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 - 1)
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 + 1)


# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K" while meeting all the given constraints. Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different block placements or block types to create your desired structure.
