To generate a stable structure resembling the character "O" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base of the structure using two b11 blocks aligned in the middle.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

Step 3: Place two b31 blocks on top of the base blocks to form the sides of the structure.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

Step 4: Place two b31 blocks on top of the previous blocks to form the top and bottom of the structure.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

Step 5: Place two b13 blocks on top of the previous blocks to form the left and right sides of the structure.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

Step 6: The resulting structure will resemble the character "O" and meet all hard constraints.

Here's the complete code for generating the structure:
```python
W = 20  # Width of the map
H = 16  # Height of the map

# Function to drop a block vertically
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # Drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # Place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Place the base of the structure
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Place the sides of the structure
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 11)

# Place the top and bottom of the structure
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Place the left and right sides of the structure
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This will generate a stable structure resembling the character "O" while satisfying all the hard constraints.
