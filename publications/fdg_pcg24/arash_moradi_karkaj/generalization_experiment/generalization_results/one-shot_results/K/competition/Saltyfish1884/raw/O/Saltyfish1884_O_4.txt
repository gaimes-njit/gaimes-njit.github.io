To generate a stable structure resembling the character "O", we can use the ab_drop() function strategically to place the blocks in a stable configuration. Here is a step-by-step approach to construct the structure:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base blocks:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

This will create a solid base for stability.

Step 3: Place the vertical blocks:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

These blocks will form the vertical sides of the "O".

Step 4: Place the horizontal block:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

This block will bridge the vertical blocks, completing the structure.

Step 5: Check for stability and boundary intrusion constraints:

You can verify the stability by checking if the structure does not collapse and that the blocks are placed as low as possible. To ensure no boundary intrusion, check if the blocks are not placed outside the boundaries of the map.

Step 6: Print the final structure:

```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This will display the structure resembling the character "O".

Note: The exact placement of the blocks may vary depending on the specific requirements of the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
