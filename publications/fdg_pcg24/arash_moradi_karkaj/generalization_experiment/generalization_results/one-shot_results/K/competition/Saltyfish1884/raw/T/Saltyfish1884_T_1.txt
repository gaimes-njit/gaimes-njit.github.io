To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base of the "T" structure by dropping a b11 block on layer 0 and in the middle slot:
```python
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
```

Step 3: Place the vertical part of the "T" structure by dropping a b13 block on layer 1 and in the middle slot:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W // 2)
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal part of the "T" structure by dropping a b31 block on layer 2 and in the middle slot:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```

After executing these steps, the structure will resemble the character "T" and will meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Note: Make sure to execute each step in order, as the placement order is crucial for stability. Additionally, you can modify the placement order and positions to generate different structures that meet the given requirements.
