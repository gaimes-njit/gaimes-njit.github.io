To build the capital letter "A" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: a row block for the top bar, a column block for the middle line, and a row block for the bottom bar. We will place the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Place the bottom bar of the "A"
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Place the middle line of the "A"
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Place the top bar of the "A"
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are balanced and well-supported, ensuring stability. The resulting structure resembles the capital letter "A".
