To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "B", we can break it down into three block types:

1. The top horizontal bar: b31 block type
2. The vertical line on the right: b13 block type
3. The bottom horizontal bar: b31 block type

We will start building the structure from the bottom to the top. Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

This implementation will create a stable B-shaped structure in the level.
