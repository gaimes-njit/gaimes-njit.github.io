To build the structure in the shape of the letter "E", we will follow the bottom-to-top approach. We will start by placing the base blocks and then add the upper blocks to form the letter "E". By following the hints provided, we can create a stable and similar structure. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the base blocks
```
ab_drop("b31", 7)  # Place a row block at x_position=7
ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Place a row block at x_position=8
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place a row block at x_position=9
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Place a row block at x_position=10
ab_drop("b31", 11)  # Place a row block at x_position=11
```

Step 2: Place the upper blocks
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)  # Place a column block at x_position=7
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place a column block at x_position=9
ab_drop("b13", 11)  # Place a column block at x_position=11
ab_drop("b11", 8)  # Place a square block at x_position=8
ab_drop("b11", 10)  # Place a square block at x_position=10
```

And that's the complete implementation for generating a structure in the shape of the letter "E". The blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top order to ensure stability. The final structure will resemble the letter "E" and will be stable.

Note: Since there are multiple valid solutions for generating the letter "E", this is just one possible implementation.
