To create the letter "H" in the given level, we can break it down into three blocks: two row blocks (b31) and one column block (b13). We can place the two row blocks on the bottom rows and the column block in the middle.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the first row block (b31) at the bottom-left corner:
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

Step 2: Place the second row block (b31) next to the first row block:
```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Step 3: Place the column block (b13) in the middle of the two row blocks:
```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```

The complete implementation, ensuring stability and similarity to the letter "H", is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```
