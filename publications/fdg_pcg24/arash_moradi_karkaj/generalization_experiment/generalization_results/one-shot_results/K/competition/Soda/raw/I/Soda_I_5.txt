To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "I", we can start by placing a row block ("b31") in the center of the grid, followed by a column block ("b13") on top of it. This will create the vertical bar of the "I". Finally, we can place another row block on top of the column block to complete the horizontal bar of the "I".

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Explanation:
1. The first line drops a row block at the x-position 9, which places it in the center of the grid.
2. The second line drops a column block on top of the row block. Again, it is placed at the x-position 9, ensuring it is centered.
3. The third line drops another row block on top of the column block to complete the "I" shape.

This implementation creates a structure that looks like the capital letter "I" and ensures stability by following the bottom-to-top approach and balancing the blocks.
