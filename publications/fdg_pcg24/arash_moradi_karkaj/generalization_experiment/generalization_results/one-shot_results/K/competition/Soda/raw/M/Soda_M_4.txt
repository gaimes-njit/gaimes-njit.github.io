First, let's start by creating the base of the "M" shape using two row blocks ("b31") stacked on top of each other. We'll position them at x = 7 and x = 12 to create a gap in the middle:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

Next, let's add the two diagonal sides of the "M" shape using column blocks ("b13"). We'll position them at x = 4 and x = 15:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 15)
```

Finally, we'll add the middle part of the "M" shape using a row block ("b31"). We'll position it at x = 10:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 15)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
