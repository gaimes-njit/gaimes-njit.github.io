To create a structure that looks like the letter "P", we can break it down into smaller blocks. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the column block "b13" at the bottom-left corner:
    - ab_drop("b13", 0)

2. Place the row block "b31" right above the column block:
    - ab_drop("b31", 1)

3. Place another row block "b31" right above the previous one:
    - ab_drop("b31", 2)

4. Place a square block "b11" on top of the two row blocks to form the curve of "P":
    - ab_drop("b11", 1)

5. Place another square block "b11" right next to the previous one to complete the curve of "P":
    - ab_drop("b11", 2)

6. Place a column block "b13" on top of the two square blocks to form the vertical line of "P":
    - ab_drop("b13", 2)

7. Place a row block "b31" on top of the column block to form the top of "P":
    - ab_drop("b31", 2)

8. Place another row block "b31" right above the previous one to complete the top of "P":
    - ab_drop("b31", 1)

This complete implementation enforces the best stability and similarity to the letter "P". The code block with the series of ab_drop() calls is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```
