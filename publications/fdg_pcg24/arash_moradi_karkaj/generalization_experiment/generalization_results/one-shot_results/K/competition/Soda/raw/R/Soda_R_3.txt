To build the capital letter "R" using the block-stacking technique, we can break it down into several blocks: a row block (b31) for the base, a column block (b13) for the vertical stroke, and another column block (b13) for the diagonal stroke.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1:
Place the row block (b31) at the bottom of the grid, centered at position 10.
```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Step 2:
Place the first column block (b13) for the vertical stroke, centered at position 7.
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

Step 3:
Place the second column block (b13) for the diagonal stroke, centered at position 12.
```
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```
