To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "I" and meets all the given constraints, we will use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in the proper sequence and positions.

Here is the step-by-step process to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the base block (`b31`) at the center of the bottom layer:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```

3. Drop the vertical blocks (`b13`) above the base block, aligning them to the center of the previous blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W // 2)
ab_drop('b13', W // 2)
```

4. Drop the horizontal blocks (`b31`) above the vertical blocks, aligning them to the center of the previous blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```

The above steps will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "I" and satisfies the stability constraint. To ensure that the structure does not intrude on the boundary, we are aligning the blocks to the center of the map at each step.

Note: The `ab_drop()` function will handle the dropping position and order to maintain stability and prevent boundary intrusion automatically.
