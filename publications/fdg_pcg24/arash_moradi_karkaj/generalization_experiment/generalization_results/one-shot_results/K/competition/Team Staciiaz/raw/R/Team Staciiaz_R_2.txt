To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "R" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the vertical block b13 at slot 0 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```
This will drop the b13 block vertically at slot 0, so its left side aligns with the left boundary of the map.

3. Drop a horizontal block b31 at slot 1, aligned with the bottom of the b13 block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will drop the b31 block horizontally at slot 1, just above the b13 block.

4. Drop a vertical block b13 at slot 4, aligned with the right side of the b31 block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```
This will drop the b13 block vertically at slot 4, so its right side aligns with the right boundary of the map.

5. Drop a horizontal block b31 at slot 1, aligned with the bottom of the previous b13 block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will drop the b31 block horizontally at slot 1, just above the previous b13 block.

6. Drop a vertical block b13 at slot 7, aligned with the right side of the b31 block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```
This will drop the b13 block vertically at slot 7, so its right side aligns with the right boundary of the map.

7. Finally, drop a horizontal block b31 at slot 1, aligned with the bottom of the previous b13 block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will drop the b31 block horizontally at slot 1, just above the previous b13 block.

The resulting structure will resemble the character "R" and meet all the constraints.
