To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks one by one.

First, we need to drop the bottom left segment of the "W." We can achieve this by dropping a `b31` block with its center aligned to slot 3 using the `ab_drop('b31', 3)` function.

Next, we need to drop the bottom right segment of the "W." We can achieve this by dropping a `b31` block with its center aligned to slot 17 using the `ab_drop('b31', 17)` function.

Finally, we need to drop the top segment of the "W." We can achieve this by dropping a `b13` block with its center aligned to slot 10 using the `ab_drop('b13', 10)` function.

Here is the code to generate the stable structure:

```python
# initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # implementation of ab_drop() function goes here

# drop bottom left segment
ab_drop('b31', 3)

# drop bottom right segment
ab_drop('b31', 17)

# drop top segment
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

This will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" and meets all the constraints.
