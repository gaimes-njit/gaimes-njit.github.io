4. Solution
To create a stable structure that looks like the letter "Q" using the 'ab drop()' function, follow these steps:

- Start by dropping a b31 block at layer 15 with its center at slot 5. This block will represent the vertical part of the "Q".
- Next, drop a b13 block at layer 12 with its center at slot 5. This block will represent the tail of the "Q".
- Finally, drop a b31 block at layer 9 with its center at slot 11. This block will complete the circular part of the "Q".
- Make sure to carefully position each block and drop them in the correct order to create a stable structure that resembles the letter "Q".

By following these steps and using the 'ab drop()' function effectively, you can create a stable structure that looks like the letter "Q" on the map.
