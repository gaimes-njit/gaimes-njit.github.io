To generate a stable structure that looks like the "T", we can follow these steps using the 'ab drop()' function:

1. Start by dropping a b13 block at layer H = 15 with its center at slot 9.

2. Next, drop a b31 block at layer H = 12 with its center at slot 9. This will form the horizontal line of the "T".

3. Finally, drop another b13 block at layer H = 9 with its center at slot 9 to complete the vertical line of the "T".

By following these steps and carefully positioning each block using the 'ab drop()' function, you can create a stable structure that resembles the letter "T" on the map.
