1. The letter "E" can be drawn with asterisks as follows:
```
*****
*
*****
*
*****
```

2. Listing the asterisks and spaces generated in each row:
- Row 1: 5 asterisks
- Row 2: 1 asterisk
- Row 3: 5 asterisks
- Row 4: 1 asterisk
- Row 5: 5 asterisks

3. Replacing asterisks with "x" and spaces with "y":
```
xxxxx
y
xxxxx
y
xxxxx
```

4. Writing out each "x" and "y" side-by-side for each row:
- Row 1: xxxxx
- Row 2: y
- Row 3: xxxxx
- Row 4: y
- Row 5: xxxxx

5. Indicating the position of each variable:
- Row 1: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
- Row 2: y-1
- Row 3: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
- Row 4: y-1
- Row 5: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5

6. Returning a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

Note: The "ab_drop" function and its inputs are assumed to be defined elsewhere as they are not provided in the question.
