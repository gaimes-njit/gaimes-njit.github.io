Since there are no specific dimensions mentioned for the letter "H", I will assume a width of 5 asterisks and a height of 5 rows.

1. The letter "H" with asterisks can be drawn as follows:
```
*   *
*   *
*****
*   *
*   *
```

2. Line-by-line list of asterisks and spaces:
- Row 1: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
- Row 2: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
- Row 3: 5 asterisks
- Row 4: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
- Row 5: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk

3. Representing asterisks as x and spaces as y:
- Row 1: 1x, 3y, 1x
- Row 2: 1x, 3y, 1x
- Row 3: 5x
- Row 4: 1x, 3y, 1x
- Row 5: 1x, 3y, 1x

4. Writing out each x and y for each row:
- Row 1: xyyx
- Row 2: xyyx
- Row 3: xxxxx
- Row 4: xyyx
- Row 5: xyyx

5. Indicating the position of each variable:
- Row 1: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; x-5
- Row 2: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; x-5
- Row 3: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
- Row 4: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; x-5
- Row 5: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; x-5

6. Sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b12", 1)
ab_drop("b12", 2)
ab_drop("b12", 3)
ab_drop("b12", 4)
ab_drop("b12", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b14", 1)
ab_drop("b14", 2)
ab_drop("b14", 3)
ab_drop("b14", 4)
ab_drop("b14", 5)
ab_drop("b15", 1)
ab_drop("b15", 2)
ab_drop("b15", 3)
ab_drop("b15", 4)
ab_drop("b15", 5)
```

Note: The above function calls assume that `ab_drop` takes two arguments: the first being the variable representing the column and the second being the row number. The variables "b11", "b12", "b13", "b14", and "b15" represent the columns from left to right.
