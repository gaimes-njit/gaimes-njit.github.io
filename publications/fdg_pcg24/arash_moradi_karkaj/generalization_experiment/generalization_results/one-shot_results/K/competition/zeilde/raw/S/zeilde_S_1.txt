1. The drawing of the letter "S" with asterisks:
```
 ****
 *
  **
    *
**** 
```

2. Line-by-line breakdown of asterisks and spaces:
Row 1: 4 asterisks, 0 spaces
Row 2: 1 asterisk, 0 spaces
Row 3: 2 asterisks, 1 space
Row 4: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces
Row 5: 4 asterisks, 0 spaces

3. Representing asterisks as "x" and spaces as "y":
```
xxxx
x
xx
xyyyy
xxxx
```

4. Listing each "x" and "y" side-by-side for each row:
Row 1: "xxxx"
Row 2: "x"
Row 3: "xx"
Row 4: "xyyyy"
Row 5: "xxxx"

5. Indicating the position of each variable:
Row 1: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4"
Row 2: "x-1"
Row 3: "x-1; x-2"
Row 4: "x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; y-5"
Row 5: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4"

6. Converting the positions into `ab_drop` function calls:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
```
