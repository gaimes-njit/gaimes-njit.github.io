To create a stable structure resembling "A" while satisfying the given constraints, the following `ab_drop()` calls can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

These `ab_drop()` calls will drop the blocks in the correct order and position to form the shape of "A", while ensuring that the constraints are met.
