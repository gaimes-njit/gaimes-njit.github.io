To construct a stable structure resembling "C" while satisfying the given constraints, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the empty map:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block to construct the vertical part of "C":

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Drop the second block to construct the horizontal part of "C":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Drop the third block to complete the vertical part of "C":

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

The complete code snippet would look like this:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

You can further adjust and optimize the position of the blocks, but this solution fulfills the given constraints and forms a structure resembling the letter "C".
