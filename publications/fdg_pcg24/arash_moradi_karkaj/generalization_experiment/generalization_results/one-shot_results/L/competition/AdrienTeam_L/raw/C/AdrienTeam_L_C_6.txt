Here is the `ab_drop()` function calls to generate the structure resembling "C":

```
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the base horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the vertical block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Drop the vertical block on the right side
ab_drop('b13', 16)

# Drop the top horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

This code will create a structure in the shape of the letter "C" with the given constraints.
