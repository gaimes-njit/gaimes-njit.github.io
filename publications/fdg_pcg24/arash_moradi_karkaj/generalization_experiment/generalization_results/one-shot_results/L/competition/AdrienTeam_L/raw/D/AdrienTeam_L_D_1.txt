Here is one possible solution to create a stable structure resembling "D" while satisfying all the specified constraints:

```
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop b31 block
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Drop b13 block
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Drop horizontal blocks for the top part
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)

# Drop vertical blocks for the middle part
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Drop horizontal blocks for the bottom part
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

This solution uses the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a specific order and position to create a stable structure resembling the letter "D". The blocks are dropped starting from layer 0 and progressing upwards to layer 15. The structure is created by dropping blocks in a strategic pattern to achieve the desired shape.
