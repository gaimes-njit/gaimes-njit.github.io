To create a stable structure resembling "D" while satisfying the specified constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure with an empty grid.
2. Drop the base block ('b31') centered at slot 1.
3. Drop the vertical block ('b13') centered at slot 0, just above the base block.

Here is the code to generate the structure:

```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the base block ('b31')
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Drop the vertical block ('b13')
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

By following these steps, we can create a stable structure resembling the letter "D" that satisfies all the given constraints.
