Here is one possible solution to create a stable structure resembling "D" while satisfying all the constraints:

```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# First, drop the horizontal block (b31) on the bottom layer (layer 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Then, drop the vertical block (b13) to the left of the horizontal block on layer 1
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Next, drop the vertical block (b13) to the right of the horizontal block on layer 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Finally, drop the horizontal block (b31) on layer 2, aligning it with the vertical blocks
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This solution starts by dropping the horizontal block (b31) on the bottom layer (layer 0) at slot 1. Then, it drops two vertical blocks (b13) on layer 1, aligning them with the horizontal block. Finally, another horizontal block (b31) is dropped on layer 2, aligning it with the vertical blocks. The resulting structure resembles the letter "D".
