Here is one possible solution for constructing the "E" structure using the `ab_drop()` function:

```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first three `ab_drop('b11', 0)` calls place three vertical blocks next to each other in slot 0, creating the left vertical line of the "E".
2. Next, the `ab_drop('b13', 0)` call places a vertical block that extends vertically from slots 0 to 2, connecting to the bottom of the left vertical line.
3. The `ab_drop('b11', 1)` calls place two horizontal blocks in slot 1, creating the horizontal crossbar of the "E".
4. Finally, the `ab_drop('b31', 1)` call places a horizontal block in slot 1, connecting the crossbar to the top of the left vertical line.

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls ensures that the blocks are dropped in the correct order and position to form the desired "E" structure, while also satisfying all the given constraints.
