To create the structure resembling the letter "E" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully position and order the blocks being dropped. Here is the code to achieve that:

```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# First step: Drop horizontal block at the bottom layer
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Second step: Drop vertical block at the leftmost slot, one layer above the bottom layer
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Third step: Drop vertical block at the leftmost slot, two layers above the bottom layer
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Fourth step: Drop horizontal block at the second layer from the top, one slot to the right of the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Fifth step: Drop horizontal block at the third layer from the top, one slot to the right of the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Sixth step: Drop horizontal block at the fourth layer from the top, one slot to the right of the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Seventh step: Drop vertical block at the leftmost slot, six layers above the bottom layer
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Eighth step: Drop vertical block at the leftmost slot, seven layers above the bottom layer
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Ninth step: Drop horizontal block at the eighth layer from the top, one slot to the right of the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Tenth step: Drop horizontal block at the ninth layer from the top, one slot to the right of the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Eleventh step: Drop horizontal block at the tenth layer from the top, one slot to the right of the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Twelfth step: Drop horizontal block at the eleventh layer from the top, one slot to the right of the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Thirteenth step: Drop horizontal block at the twelfth layer from the top, one slot to the right of the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Fourteenth step: Drop horizontal block at the thirteenth layer from the top, one slot to the right of the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Fifteenth step: Drop vertical block at the leftmost slot, fourteen layers above the bottom layer
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Sixteenth step: Drop vertical block at the leftmost slot, fifteen layers above the bottom layer
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

The code above follows the given constraints and drops the blocks in the correct order and positions to form a stable structure resembling the letter "E".
