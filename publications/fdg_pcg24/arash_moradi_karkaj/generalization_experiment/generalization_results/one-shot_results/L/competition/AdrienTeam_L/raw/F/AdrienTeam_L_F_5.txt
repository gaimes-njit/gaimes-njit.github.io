The structure that resembles "F" can be created using the following `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

Explanation:
1. Drop a vertical block (`b13`) with its center aligned at slot 0.
2. Drop a square block (`b11`) with its center aligned at slot 0.
3. Drop a square block (`b11`) with its center aligned at slot 0.
4. Drop a square block (`b11`) with its center aligned at slot 1.
5. Drop a horizontal block (`b31`) with its center aligned at slot 0.

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will create a stable structure resembling the letter "F" while satisfying all the given constraints.
