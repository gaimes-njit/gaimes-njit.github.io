To create a stable structure resembling "F" while satisfying all the given constraints, you can use the following series of `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Drop a horizontal block (b31) in the second slot to form the top bar of "F"
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Drop a vertical block (b11) in the second slot below the top bar
ab_drop('b11',3)   # Drop a vertical block (b11) in the third slot below the top bar
ab_drop('b11',4)   # Drop the third vertical block (b11) in the fourth slot beside the previous two blocks
ab_drop('b11',4)   # Drop the fourth vertical block (b11) in the fourth slot beside the previous three blocks
ab_drop('b11',5)   # Drop the fifth vertical block (b11) in the fifth slot beside the previous four blocks
```

These `ab_drop()` calls will create a stable structure resembling the letter "F" while adhering to all the specified constraints.
