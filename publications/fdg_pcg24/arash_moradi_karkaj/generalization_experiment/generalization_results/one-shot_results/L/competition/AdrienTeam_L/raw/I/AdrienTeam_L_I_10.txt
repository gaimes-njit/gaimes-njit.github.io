Here is the solution to generate a stable structure resembling the letter "I" according to the given constraints:

```python
# Define the map's width and height
W = 20
H = 16

# Create an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]


# Drop the blocks to construct the structure
ab_drop('b31', 9)    # Bottom horizontal block

# First vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Second vertical block
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Top horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Print the structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This code generates a stable structure resembling the letter "I" by dropping the blocks according to the provided `ab_drop()` function. The blocks are dropped in a specific order and position to satisfy the given constraints.
