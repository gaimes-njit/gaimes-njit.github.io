Here is one possible solution to create a stable structure resembling "I":

```python
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop initial block to build the bottom layer
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Drop two continuous blocks to create the middle layer
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# Drop a vertical block to create the upper layer
ab_drop('b13', 1)

```

This solution starts by dropping a vertical block ('b13') in the middle slot of the bottom layer. Then, it creates the middle layer by dropping two continuous horizontal blocks ('b31') in the first and second slots. Finally, it drops another vertical block ('b13') to create the upper layer.
