To create a stable structure resembling the letter "I", we can start by dropping a vertical block ('b13') to form the upright part of the letter. After that, we can drop two horizontal blocks ('b11') on top of each other to create the crossbar of the letter. Here is the code to generate the structure:

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

Explanation:
1. We first drop a vertical block ('b13') using the `ab_drop()` function. We align its center with slot 9 to ensure symmetry.
2. Next, we drop a horizontal block ('b11') on slot 8 to form the lower half of the crossbar.
3. Finally, we drop another horizontal block ('b11') on slot 8 to complete the upper half of the crossbar.

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be alternative solutions that meet the given constraints.
