The structure of "J" can be created by using the following `ab_drop()` inputs:

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)

ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

The first input drops a vertical block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units at slot 9, which represents the center of the base of the "J".

The second and third inputs drop a horizontal block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit at slot 8, and a vertical block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units at slot 7. These two blocks combine to form the vertical part of the "J".

Together, these `ab_drop()` inputs create a stable structure resembling the letter "J" that satisfies all the specified constraints.
