The following `ab_drop()` calls can be used to create a stable structure resembling "M" while meeting all the specified constraints:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

This sequence of calls will drop the blocks in the correct order and position to form the "M" shape. By dropping the blocks from bottom to top, and using the provided constraints, we can ensure that the structure is stable and meets all the given requirements.
