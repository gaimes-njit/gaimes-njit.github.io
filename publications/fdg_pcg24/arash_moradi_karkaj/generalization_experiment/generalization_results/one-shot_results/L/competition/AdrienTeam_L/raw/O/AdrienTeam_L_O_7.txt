Here is the code to generate the structure resembling "O":

```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Bottom layer
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 8)

# Middle layer
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 7)

# Top layer
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

Note: The given constraints do not provide sufficient information to accurately determine the structure resembling "O". Therefore, the provided code is an example and may not be the exact solution. It is recommended to experiment with different block positions and orientations to achieve the desired shape.
