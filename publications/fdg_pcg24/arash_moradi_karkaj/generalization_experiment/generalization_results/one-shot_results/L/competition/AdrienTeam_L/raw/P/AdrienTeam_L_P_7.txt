Here is one way to generate the "P" structure using the given constraints:

```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop first block
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Drop second block
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Drop third block
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Drop fourth block
ab_drop('b11', 1)

# Drop fifth block
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Drop sixth block
ab_drop('b11', 1)

# Drop seventh block
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

Note: The output can vary, as there may be multiple valid solutions. This is just one possible sequence of `ab_drop()` inputs that satisfies the given constraints to create a structure resembling "P".
