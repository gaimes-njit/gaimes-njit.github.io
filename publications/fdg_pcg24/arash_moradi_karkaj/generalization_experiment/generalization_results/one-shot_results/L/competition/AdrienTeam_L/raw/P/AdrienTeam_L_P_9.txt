```
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks to form the "P" shape
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
Note: The above code assumes that the `ab_drop()` function is already defined in the environment.
