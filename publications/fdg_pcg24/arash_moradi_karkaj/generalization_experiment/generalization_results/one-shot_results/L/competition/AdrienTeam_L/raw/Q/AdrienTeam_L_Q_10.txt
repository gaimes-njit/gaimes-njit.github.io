Here is a possible solution to create the structure resembling "Q":

```
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

Explanation:
1. Drop a b11 block at slot 6, which represents the leftmost part of the "Q".
2. Drop a b11 block at slot 7, aligning its center with the previous block to create the upper left corner of the "Q".
3. Drop a b11 block at slot 8, aligning its center with the previous block to create the upper middle part of the "Q".
4. Drop a b31 block at slot 7, aligning its center with the previous block to create the upper diagonal part of the "Q".
5. Drop a b13 block at slot 6, which represents the bottom part of the "Q".

Note that the order and position of the blocks being dropped are crucial to meet the constraints and create a stable structure resembling a "Q".
