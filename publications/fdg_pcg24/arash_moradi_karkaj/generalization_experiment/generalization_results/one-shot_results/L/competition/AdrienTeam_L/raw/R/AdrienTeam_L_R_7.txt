Here is an example solution to construct the structure resembling "R" using the `ab_drop()` function:

```
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Dropping the blocks to construct the "R" shape
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 10)

```

This solution starts from the bottom layer (layer 0) and moves upwards to construct the "R" shape. The blocks are dropped in the specific order and positions to meet the given constraints and create a stable structure resembling "R". Note that the output provided here is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid solutions that meet the constraints.
