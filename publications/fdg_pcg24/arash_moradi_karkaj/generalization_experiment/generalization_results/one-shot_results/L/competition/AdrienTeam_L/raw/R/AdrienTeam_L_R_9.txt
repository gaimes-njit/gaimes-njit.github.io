First, let's initialize the structure with an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```
Next, we can start building the "R" shape from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15). Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks vertically.

To create the bottom part of the "R" shape, we can drop a horizontal block with a width of 2 units and a height of 1 unit:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

To create the vertical part of the "R" shape, we can drop a vertical block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 2 units:
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

Finally, to create the top part of the "R" shape, we can drop a horizontal block with a width of 2 units and a height of 1 unit:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Here is the final code block with all the `ab_drop()` calls:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```
