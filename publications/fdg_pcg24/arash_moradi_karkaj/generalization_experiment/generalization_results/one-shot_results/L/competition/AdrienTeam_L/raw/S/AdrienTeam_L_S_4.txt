The starting structure of size WxH is given as a 20x16 grid initialized with empty spaces:

```
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

To create the structure resembling "S" while adhering to the constraints, the following ab_drop() calls can be utilized:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 17)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

Explanation:

- The first `ab_drop('b31', 2)` call drops a horizontal block at slot 2 on layer 0. This block acts as the base of the "S" structure.
- The second `ab_drop('b31', 17)` call drops another horizontal block at slot 17 on layer 0, adjacent to the first base block.
- The next three `ab_drop('b11', 9)` calls drop three vertical blocks at slot 9 on layers 0, 2, and 3 respectively. These vertical blocks form the right side of the "S" structure.
- The `ab_drop('b31', 12)` call drops a horizontal block at slot 12 on layer 3, connecting the two vertical blocks and completing the right side of the "S" structure.

And that's it! The structure resembling the "S" shape has been formed by following the given constraints.

The code block with the ab_drop() calls for the "S" structure is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 17)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```
