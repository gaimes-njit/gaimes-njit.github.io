To create a stable structure resembling "T", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the map using the given code: 
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the first block, which should be a vertical block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units, to form the base of the "T":
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

3. Rotate the 'L' character and drop it on top of the vertical block to form the vertical part of the "T":
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ab_drop('b13', 8)
   ```

4. Finally, drop a horizontal block with a width of 2 units and a height of 3 units on top of the vertical block to complete the "T":
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 9)
   ab_drop('b11', 10)
   ```

The complete code block for generating the "T" structure is as follows:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
