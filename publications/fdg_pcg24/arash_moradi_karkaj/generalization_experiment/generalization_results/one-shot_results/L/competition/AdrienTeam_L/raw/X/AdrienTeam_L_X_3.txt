The code to generate the "X" structure using the `ab_drop()` function while adhering to the constraints is as follows:

```
# Initialize the map
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks to construct the "X" structure
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Bottom-left part of the "X"
ab_drop('b13', 0)   # Top-left part of the "X"

# Rotate the "L" to obtain the mirror image for the top-right part of the "X"
ab_drop('b31', 18)  # Bottom-right part of the "X"
ab_drop('b13', 19)  # Top-right part of the "X"
```

This code follows the given constraints and uses the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks vertically to construct the "X" shape.
