The goal is to construct a structure resembling the letter "Z" using the available block types ('b11', 'b31', 'b13') and the provided `ab_drop()` function while adhering to the given constraints. Here is a possible solution:

```
ab_drop('b31',0)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',1)
```

In this solution, we start by dropping a horizontal block ('b31') at slot 0, followed by a vertical block ('b13') at slot 1. Then, we drop three 'b11' blocks to complete the letter "Z" shape.
