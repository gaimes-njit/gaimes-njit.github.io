Here is an example solution to build the structure resembling "Z" using the `ab_drop()` function and following the given constraints:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Building the left vertical part of the "Z"
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',1)

# Building the bottom horizontal part of the "Z"
ab_drop('b31',0)

# Building the right vertical part of the "Z"
ab_drop('b11',18)
ab_drop('b11',18)
ab_drop('b13',19)
```

Note: The exact positioning of the blocks in the structure might vary depending on the specific starting conditions and gravity in the game.
