To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "J" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a strategic manner. Here is a proposed solution:

1. First, we need to ensure the stability of the structure. We will start by dropping a b11 block at the center slot (y = W//2) to serve as the base of the structure. This will ensure stability from the bottom.

ab_drop('b11', W//2)

2. Next, we will drop a b13 block at the center slot (y = W//2) to create the vertical portion of the "J" shape. We will check the stability after each drop.

ab_drop('b13', W//2)

3. To create the horizontal portion of the "J" shape, we will drop a b31 block at slot y = W//2 - 1. We need to check stability before dropping this block. If the structure [2, W//2] is empty, we can drop the block at slot y = W//2 - 1. Otherwise, we will drop it at slot y = W//2 + 1.

if structure[2][W//2] == ' ':
    ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 1)
else:
    ab_drop('b31', W//2 + 1)

4. To complete the "J" shape, we will drop another b31 block at slot y = W//2 - 1, just above the previous one. Again, we need to check stability before dropping.

ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 1)

5. Finally, we will check if the resulting structure resembles the uppercase letter "J". We can print the structure to verify.

for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))

This solution ensures stability by dropping blocks in a strategic manner and satisfies the constraints of the block-stacking problem. It also results in a structure that resembles the uppercase character "J".
