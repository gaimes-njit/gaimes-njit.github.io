To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "N", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) upwards.
3. Drop a b13 block (vertical block) at slot 2 to form the left vertical line of the "N".
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```
   Coordinates: (15, 2)

4. Drop a b31 block (horizontal block) at slot 3 to form the top horizontal line of the "N".
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 3)
   ```
   Coordinates: (14, 3), (14, 4), (14, 5)

5. Drop another b13 block at slot 4 to complete the right vertical line of the "N".
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 4)
   ```
   Coordinates: (13, 4)

6. The structure now resembles the uppercase character "N" and meets the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Note: The specific coordinates (layer, slot) may vary depending on the execution, as long as the structure remains stable.
