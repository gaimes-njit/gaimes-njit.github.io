To meet the given constraints and generate a stable structure resembling the uppercase letter "P", we can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code snippet:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Perform the necessary `ab_drop()` calls to drop the blocks in the desired positions, ensuring stability at each step. The order of the drops is crucial, and we should start from the bottom and work our way up. We need to drop one b31 block and two b13 blocks.

First, let's drop the b31 block. To ensure stability, we need to drop it in the center slots, so we choose `y=9`:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Next, let's drop the two b13 blocks. These blocks should be placed to provide support for the b31 block. We choose `y=8` for the first b13 block and `y=10` for the second b13 block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

Step 3: Check if the current structure resembles the uppercase letter "P". We can visually inspect the structure, or we can define a function that compares the structure to the desired pattern. In this case, we can define a function `is_resembling_p()` that checks if the structure matches the pattern of the letter "P". Once the function is defined, we can use it to check the resemblance and proceed accordingly.

Step 4: If the resemblance check in Step 3 is successful, we've completed our task. If not, we can repeat Steps 2-3 with different slot choices for the b31 block and adjust the support b13 blocks accordingly.

By following these steps and iteratively adjusting the slot choices for the blocks, we can generate a stable structure resembling the uppercase letter "P" while meeting all the given constraints. Remember to perform stability checks before each `ab_drop()` call and ensure the overall stability and resemblance to the desired shape.
