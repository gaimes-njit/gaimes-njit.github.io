To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Q" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.
2. Start by dropping a b13 block at slot 8 using the ab_drop() function.
3. Drop two b31 blocks on top of the b13 block at slots 4-6 and 10-12 respectively.
4. Drop a b31 block at slots 5-7 below the center of the b13 block to provide stability.
5. Drop a b13 block at slots 7-9 on top of the second b31 block.
6. Drop a b11 block at slot 8 in the center of the b13 block.
7. Drop a b13 block at slots 10-12 on top of the first b31 block.
8. Drop a b11 block at slot 11 in the center of the b13 block.
9. Finally, drop a b11 block at slot 10 on top of the b13 block to complete the structure.

The resulting structure will resemble the uppercase letter "Q" and will meet all the hard constraints. The stability of each block drop is ensured by checking for support from previously dropped blocks before each drop.
