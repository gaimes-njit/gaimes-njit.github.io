To form the shape resembling the letter "E", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() function calls:

ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the first vertical brick at x_position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place the square brick above the vertical brick at x_position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place another square brick above the previous square brick at x_position 4
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Place the second vertical brick at x_position 8

This sequence of function calls will generate the desired shape resembling the letter "E" by utilizing the available bricks and following the stability and boundary collision rules.
