To form the shape resembling the letter "G", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() functions:

```python
# map initialization
map = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Generate the lower part of the "G"
ab_drop('b13', 6) # occupy cells (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
ab_drop('b31', 7) # occupy cells (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)

# Generate the upper part of the "G"
ab_drop('b13', 6) # occupy cells (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
ab_drop('b11', 5) # occupy cell (5, 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8) # occupy cell (8, 7)
ab_drop('b11', 4) # occupy cell (4, 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9) # occupy cell (9, 8)
ab_drop('b11', 4) # occupy cell (4, 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9) # occupy cell (9, 9)
ab_drop('b11', 4) # occupy cell (4, 10)
ab_drop('b11', 8) # occupy cell (8, 10)
ab_drop('b13', 6) # occupy cells (6, 11), (6, 12), (6, 13)
ab_drop('b31', 7) # occupy cells (6, 14), (7, 14), (8, 14)
```

Please note that the stability and avoiding boundary collisions are automatically ensured by the ab_drop() function according to the given rules.
