To form the shape resembling the letter "W", we can start placing bricks from the bottom and work our way up. Here is one possible solution:

```
ab_drop('b11', 5)    # Placing the middle cell of the middle "W" section
ab_drop('b31', 4)    # Placing the bottom portion of the middle "W" section
ab_drop('b31', 6)    # Placing the top portion of the middle "W" section
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Placing the bottom-left portion of the left "W" section
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Placing the middle-left portion of the left "W" section
ab_drop('b31', 0)    # Placing the top-left portion of the left "W" section
ab_drop('b31', 10)   # Placing the bottom-right portion of the right "W" section
ab_drop('b13', 9)    # Placing the middle-right portion of the right "W" section
ab_drop('b31', 8)    # Placing the top-right portion of the right "W" section
```

This solution follows the structure of the letter "W" by placing bricks in a strategic manner. We start with the middle cell of the middle "W" section and then build around it. By using the available brick types and positions, we can create the desired shape.
