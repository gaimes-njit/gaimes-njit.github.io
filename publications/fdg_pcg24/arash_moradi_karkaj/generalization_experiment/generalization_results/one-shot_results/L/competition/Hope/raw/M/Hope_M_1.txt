To create an "M" structure using the `ab_drop` function, you can follow these steps sequentially:

1. Create two smaller blocks by dropping a single block of `b13` horizontally. Place the first `b13` block at x position 0. Place the second `b13` block at x position 1.
   
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

2. Create the middle part of the "M" structure by dropping a single block of `b11` at the center. Place the `b11` block at x position 1.
   
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 1)
   ```

3. Create the side parts of the "M" structure by dropping two `b31` blocks symmetrically on either side of the center block. Place the first `b31` block at x position 0 and the second `b31` block at x position 2.
   
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

This sequence of commands will create an "M" structure inside a 20*16 box, starting from the top-left corner (position 0,0).
