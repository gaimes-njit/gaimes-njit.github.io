To create the structure of letter "N" inside a 20*16 box, you can use the following commands:

1. Drop three 1*3 blocks vertically to create the left side of the letter "N":
   - ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Starts at position (0,0) and drops a 1*3 block vertically downwards
   - ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Starts at position (1,0) and drops a 1*3 block vertically downwards
   - ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Starts at position (2,0) and drops a 1*3 block vertically downwards
   
2. Drop a 1*1 block at position (3,2) to connect the left and right sides of the letter "N":
   - ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Starts at position (3,0) and drops a 1*1 block vertically downwards
   
3. Drop three 1*3 blocks vertically to create the right side of the letter "N":
   - ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Starts at position (4,0) and drops a 1*3 block vertically downwards
   - ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Starts at position (5,0) and drops a 1*3 block vertically downwards
   - ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Starts at position (6,0) and drops a 1*3 block vertically downwards
   
By following these commands, you should be able to create the exact structure of the letter "N" inside the 20*16 box.
