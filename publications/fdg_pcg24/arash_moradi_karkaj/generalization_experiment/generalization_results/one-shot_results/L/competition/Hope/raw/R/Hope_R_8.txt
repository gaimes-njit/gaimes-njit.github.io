To create the structure exactly like "R" inside a 20*16 box, we will use the ab_drop('blocktype', x position) command to drop the blocks one by one in the desired positions. Here is the sequence of commands to achieve this:

1. Drop a b31 block at position (0, 0) using the command: ab_drop('b31', 0)
2. Drop a b13 block at position (0, 1) using the command: ab_drop('b13', 0)
3. Drop a b13 block at position (0, 4) using the command: ab_drop('b13', 0)
4. Drop a b11 block at position (1, 0) using the command: ab_drop('b11', 1)
5. Drop a b13 block at position (1, 3) using the command: ab_drop('b13', 1)
6. Drop a b31 block at position (2, 0) using the command: ab_drop('b31', 2)
7. Drop a b13 block at position (2, 4) using the command: ab_drop('b13', 2)

Repeat steps 4 to 7 until the "R" structure is complete.

Please note that the positions are specified as (x, y) where x is the column number and y is the row number starting from 0. The y position is automatically determined as the block is dropped from top to bottom.
