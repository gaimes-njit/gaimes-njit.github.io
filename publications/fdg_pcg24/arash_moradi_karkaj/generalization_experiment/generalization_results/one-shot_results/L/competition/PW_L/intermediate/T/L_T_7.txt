To generate the uppercase letter "T," you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Explanation:

1. `ab_drop('b31', 2)` - This command places a horizontal straight block (`b31`) starting from the position 2. This forms the top horizontal line of the "T."

```
XXXXX
  X  
  X  
  X  
```

2. `ab_drop('b13', 1)` - This command places a vertical straight block (`b13`) starting from the position 1. This forms the vertical line of the "T."

```
XXXXX
XXX  
XXX  
  X  
```

3. `ab_drop('b11', 2)` - This command places a 1x1 square block (`b11`) starting from the position 2. This completes the "T" shape.

```
XXXXX
XXX  
XXX  
 X   
```

The resulting shape resembles the uppercase letter "T" within the defined boundaries.
