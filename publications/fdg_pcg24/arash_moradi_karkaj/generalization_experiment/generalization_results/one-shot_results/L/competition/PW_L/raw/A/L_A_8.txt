To generate the uppercase letter "A", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places a vertical straight block at position 2 along the width.
2. The second command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1 along the width.
3. The third command `ab_drop('b31', 3)` places another horizontal straight block at position 3 along the width.
4. The fourth command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places another vertical straight block at position 1 along the width.

These commands, when executed consecutively, will create the uppercase letter "A" within the allowed space boundaries and following the 2D gravity rules.
