To create the uppercase English letter B, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a horizontal block (b31) at position 2. This will form the top part of the letter B.
2. Follow that by dropping a vertical block (b13) at position 1. This will form the left part of the letter B.

Here is the stream of commands:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
```
