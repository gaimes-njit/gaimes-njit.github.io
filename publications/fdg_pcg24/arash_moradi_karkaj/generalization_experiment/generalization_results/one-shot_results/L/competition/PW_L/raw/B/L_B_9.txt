To generate the uppercase letter "B", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

This series of commands will construct the letter "B" in the Tetris-like environment, following the stacking and stability rules.
