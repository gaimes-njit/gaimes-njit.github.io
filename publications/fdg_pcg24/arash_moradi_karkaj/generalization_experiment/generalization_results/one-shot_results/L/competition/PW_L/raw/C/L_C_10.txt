To generate the letter "C" using the ab_drop() commands, we can start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at the 2nd position of the width:

ab_drop('b31',2)

Next, we can place a vertical straight block (b13) at the 1st position of the width:

ab_drop('b13',1)

These commands will create the letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries.
