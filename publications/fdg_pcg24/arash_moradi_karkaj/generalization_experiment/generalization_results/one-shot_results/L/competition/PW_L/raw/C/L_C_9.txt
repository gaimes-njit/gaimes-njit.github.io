To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can use a combination of the block types b31 and b13. 

To build the letter "C" using the ab_drop() command, follow these steps:

1. Start at position (1, 1) and drop a b31 block.
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

2. Move one unit to the right and drop another b31 block.
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

3. Move one unit to the right and drop a b13 block.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

4. Move one unit to the right and drop another b13 block.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 4)
   ```

5. Move one unit to the right and drop a b13 block.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 5)
   ```

6. Move one unit to the right and drop a b31 block.
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 6)
   ```

7. Move one unit to the right and drop a b31 block.
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 7)
   ```

8. Move one unit to the right and drop a b13 block.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 8)
   ```

9. Move one unit to the right and drop another b13 block.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

10. Move one unit to the right and drop a b31 block.
    ```
    ab_drop('b31', 10)
    ```

The final stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "C" is as follows:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```
