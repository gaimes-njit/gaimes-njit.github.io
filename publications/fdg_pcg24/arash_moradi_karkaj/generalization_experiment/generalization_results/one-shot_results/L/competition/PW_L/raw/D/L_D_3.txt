To generate the uppercase letter "D," we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the first block of type b31 at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place the second block of type b31 at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Place the third block of type b31 at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place the fourth block of type b31 at position 10
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place the fifth block of type b13 at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 13)  # Place the sixth block of type b13 at position 13
ab_drop('b13', 14)  # Place the seventh block of type b13 at position 14
ab_drop('b13', 15)  # Place the eighth block of type b13 at position 15
```

This sequence of commands will generate the letter "D" in the defined environment.
