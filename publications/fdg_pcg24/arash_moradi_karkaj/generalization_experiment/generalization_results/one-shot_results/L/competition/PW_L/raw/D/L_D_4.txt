To create the uppercase letter "D" using the given block types and gravity rules, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 on the width:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
This will give us the top part of the letter "D".

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 on the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
This will complete the letter "D" by adding the straight vertical line.

The final stream of commands to create the letter "D" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
