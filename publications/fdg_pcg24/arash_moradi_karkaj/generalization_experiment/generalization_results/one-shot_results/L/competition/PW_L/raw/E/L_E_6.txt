To generate the uppercase English letter "E", we will need to use a combination of the three block types: b11, b31, and b13. The letter "E" has the following structure:

```
### 
#
### 
#
###
```

Using the given command ab_drop(x, y), we can start constructing the letter "E" as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Drop a horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Drop a single block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Drop a horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)   # Drop a single block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',3)   # Drop a horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',4)   # Drop a single block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',4)   # Drop a horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',5)   # Drop a horizontal block at position 5
ab_drop('b11',6)   # Drop a single block at position 6
ab_drop('b31',6)   # Drop a horizontal block at position 6
```

This series of commands will create an uppercase "E" that fits within the allowed space and follows the gravity rules.
