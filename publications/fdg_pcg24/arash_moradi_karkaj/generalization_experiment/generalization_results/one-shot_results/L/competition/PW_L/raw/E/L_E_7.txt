To generate the uppercase letter "E", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block of width 3 units (b31) at position 2. This will be the top bar of the letter E.
2. Next, place a vertical straight block of height 3 units (b13) at position 1. This will be the left vertical bar of the letter E.
3. Finally, place another horizontal straight block of width 3 units (b31) at position 4. This will be the middle and bottom bar of the letter E.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter E:

```python
# Top bar
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Left vertical bar
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Middle and bottom bar
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Make sure to execute these commands consecutively in order to construct the letter E accurately within the allowed space boundaries.
