Here is a possible stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "E":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This stream of commands places the block types in the following positions:

```
 b13
 b31
 b31
 b31
 b13
 b31
 b31
 b31
```

When these blocks are stacked together, they form the letter "E".
