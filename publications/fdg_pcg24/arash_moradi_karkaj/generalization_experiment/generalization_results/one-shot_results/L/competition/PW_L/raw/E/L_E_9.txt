To generate the uppercase letter "E" using the given block types and commands, you can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: 
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, one unit higher than the previous block, to complete the vertical part of the letter "E":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Finally, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, one unit higher than the previous block, to complete the top part of the letter "E":
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Overall, the sequence of commands to generate the uppercase letter "E" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
