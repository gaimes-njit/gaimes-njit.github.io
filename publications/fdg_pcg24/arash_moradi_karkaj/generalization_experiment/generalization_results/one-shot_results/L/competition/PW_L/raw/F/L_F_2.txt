Here is a solution to generate the uppercase English letter "F":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the following positions:
```
    F
    
  XYXX  
  1234  
```

Where X represents the position of the blocks and Y represents the vertical height. By following the gravity rules and avoiding intruding the height boundary, we can construct the letter "F" using the given block types.
