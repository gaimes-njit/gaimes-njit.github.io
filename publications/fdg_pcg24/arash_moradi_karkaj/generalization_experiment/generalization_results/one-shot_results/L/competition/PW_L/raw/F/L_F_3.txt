To generate the uppercase letter "F", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 on the grid: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.
2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 on the grid: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`.
3. Finally, place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 on the grid, below the previous block: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`.

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "F" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
