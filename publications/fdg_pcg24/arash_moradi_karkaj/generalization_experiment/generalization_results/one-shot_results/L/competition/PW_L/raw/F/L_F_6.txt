To generate the uppercase letter "F" using the given block types, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place a square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place a square block at position 4
```

This sequence will result in the formation of the uppercase letter "F" within the allowed boundaries of the grid.
