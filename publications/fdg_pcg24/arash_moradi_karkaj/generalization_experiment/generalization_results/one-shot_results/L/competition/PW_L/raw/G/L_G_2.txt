To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can break it down into three parts: the top horizontal line, the diagonal line, and the bottom horizontal line. We will use Block Types "b31" and "b13" to construct these parts.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "G":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Top horizontal line
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Diagonal line
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Bottom horizontal line
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Make sure to execute each command consecutively in the specified order to properly construct the letter "G".
