To generate the uppercase letter "G" using the given block types and rules, you can follow the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place a vertical block at position (1,1)
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place a vertical block at position (1,2)
ab_drop('b11',3)  # Place a square block at position (1,3)
ab_drop('b11',1)  # Place a square block at position (2,1)
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place a horizontal block at position (2,2)
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place a horizontal block at position (2,1)
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place a horizontal block at position (2,2)
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place a horizontal block at position (2,1)
```

These commands will create the uppercase letter "G" that fits within the allowed space boundaries and follows the gravity rules.
