To create the letter "H", we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical straight blocks (b13) and one horizontal straight block (b31). Here's how we can construct it:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b13',1)` places the first vertical straight block at position 1 along the width.
2. The second command `ab_drop('b13',4)` places the second vertical straight block at position 4 along the width, creating the two vertical lines of the letter "H".
3. The third command `ab_drop('b31',2)` places the horizontal straight block at position 2 along the width, connecting the two vertical lines and completing the letter "H".

By executing these three commands consecutively, we can generate the uppercase English letter "H" in the Tetris-like environment.
