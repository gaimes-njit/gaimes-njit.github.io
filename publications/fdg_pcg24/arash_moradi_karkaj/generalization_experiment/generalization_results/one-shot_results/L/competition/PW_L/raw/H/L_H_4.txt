To create the letter "H" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these instructions:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width: ab_drop('b31', 2)

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width to form the left side of the letter "H": ab_drop('b13', 1)

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Finally, place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 along the width to complete the right side of the letter "H": ab_drop('b13', 3)

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

These commands will create the letter "H" in the Tetris-like environment while following the gravity rules and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
