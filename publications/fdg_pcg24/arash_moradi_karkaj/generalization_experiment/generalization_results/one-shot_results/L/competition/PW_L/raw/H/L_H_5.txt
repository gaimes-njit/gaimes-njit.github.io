To generate the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types in the defined environment, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by placing a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
2. Then, we place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 4, creating the top part of the letter "H".
3. Next, we place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2 to create the left vertical line of the letter "H".
4. We continue by placing another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3 to create the middle vertical line of the letter "H".
5. Finally, we complete the letter "H" by placing a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 7 to create the bottom part, and another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 10 to close the right side.

By following this sequence of commands, we can generate the uppercase letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries.
