To create the uppercase letter "H" using the provided block types and environment, here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   // Place the horizontal block at position 1 along the width
ab_drop('b13', 1)   // Place the vertical block at position 1 along the width
ab_drop('b31', 3)   // Place the horizontal block at position 3 along the width
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "H" by stacking the blocks in a Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
