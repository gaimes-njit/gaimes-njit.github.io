To generate the uppercase letter "I", we can start by using a horizontal straight block (b31) and placing it at position 2. Then, we can use a vertical straight block (b13) and place it at position 1. This will form the letter "I". 

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "I":

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
```
