The stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "I" would be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation:
- First, we drop a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1 to form the upright line of the letter "I".
- Then, we drop a single square block (`b11`) at position 2 to complete the top part of the letter "I".
- After that, we drop another horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1 to extend the upright line.
- Finally, we drop three more horizontal straight blocks (`b31`) at position 1 to complete the letter "I" by extending the upright line downwards.
