To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we need to construct it using the block types and follow the gravity rules. Here's the solution:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by using the b31 block type and dropping it at position 1, which forms the vertical part of the letter "J".
2. We repeat the same step to create the horizontal part of the letter "J".
3. Finally, we use the b13 block type and drop it at position 3 to complete the letter "J".

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "J" within the allowed space boundaries and with structural stability.
