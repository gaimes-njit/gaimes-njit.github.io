Here is one possible solution to generate the uppercase letter "M" using the mentioned block types and command:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
```

This solution involves stacking five horizontal straight blocks ('b31') on top of each other to form the middle part of the letter "M". Then, three vertical straight blocks ('b13') are placed in a staggered pattern on top of the horizontal blocks to create the two slanted sides of the letter. The final result should resemble the letter "M" within the allowed space boundaries.
