To generate the capital letter "M" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
```

Explanation:

1. The first two commands (`ab_drop('b31',1)` and `ab_drop('b13',1)`) are used to create the leftmost vertical line of the "M". The first command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at width position 1, and the second command places a vertical straight block (b13) at the same position.

2. The next two commands (`ab_drop('b31',4)` and `ab_drop('b13',4)`) create the rightmost vertical line of the "M". These commands are similar to the previous ones but are placed at width position 4.

3. The fifth command (`ab_drop('b11',2)`) creates the slanted middle line of the "M". It places a square block (b11) at width position 2, forming the slanted shape.

4. The final command (`ab_drop('b11',3)`) completes the "M" by placing another square block (b11) next to the previous one, completing the slanted shape.

By following these commands, you will generate the uppercase English letter "M" within the given environment while adhering to the stacking and stability rules.
