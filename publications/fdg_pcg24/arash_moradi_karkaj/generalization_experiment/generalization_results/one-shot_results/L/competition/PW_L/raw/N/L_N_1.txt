To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we will need to use the block types b31 and b13. We will start by placing the b31 block horizontally at position 2 along the width. Then, we will place the b13 block vertically at position 1 along the width. Here are the commands to generate the letter "N":

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
```
