To generate the uppercase letter "N" using the given block types and commands, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2. This will be the left side of the letter "N".
    ```
    ab_drop('b31', 2)
    ```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1. This will be the vertical line of the letter "N".
    ```
    ab_drop('b13', 1)
    ```

3. Finally, place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4. This will be the right side of the letter "N".
    ```
    ab_drop('b31', 4)
    ```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "N" would look like this:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
