To generate the uppercase letter "O", we can use a combination of square blocks and straight blocks. Here is a sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "O":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by placing two horizontal straight blocks ('b31') at positions 1 and 4 to create the top and bottom parts of the "O".
2. Next, we place two vertical straight blocks ('b13') at positions 1 and 4 to create the left and right sides of the "O".
3. Finally, we repeat the previous steps to reinforce the shape and ensure stability.

This sequence of commands will result in the creation of the uppercase letter "O" in the specified environment.
