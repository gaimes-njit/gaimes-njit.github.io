To create the uppercase letter "P," you will need to use the `ab_drop()` command to place the blocks in the specified positions.

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31',1)       # Place a horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)       # Place a square block below at position 2
ab_drop('b13',1)       # Place a vertical block next to the previous one at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)       # Place another square block below at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)       # Place another square block below at position 3
ab_drop('b11',4)       # Place another square block below at position 4
ab_drop('b11',5)       # Place another square block below at position 5
ab_drop('b13',1)       # Place a vertical block next to the previous one at position 1
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "P" within the given environment and gravity rules.
