To create the letter "P" using the given block types, you can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

This sequence will create a stable "P" letter shape within the allowed space boundaries.
