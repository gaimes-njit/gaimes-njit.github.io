To generate the uppercase letter "P", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
```

These commands will construct the letter "P" using the given block types and follow the gravity rules in the defined environment.
