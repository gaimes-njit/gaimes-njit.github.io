First, we need to set up the initial structure of the letter "Q". We will start by placing a horizontal straight block "b31" on the second column, and then a vertical straight block "b13" on the first column. Here are the commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Next, we need to complete the letter "Q" shape by stacking more blocks. Each block will be placed one by one using the "ab_drop()" command. The complete set of commands is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

These commands will generate the uppercase English letter "Q" using the specified block types and within the allowed space boundaries.
