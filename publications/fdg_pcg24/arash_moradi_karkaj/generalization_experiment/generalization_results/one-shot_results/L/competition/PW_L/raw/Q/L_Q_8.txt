First, let's start by creating the top part of the letter "Q" using the block types b31 and b13:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

This will create the top part of the letter "Q" with the horizontal straight block b31 starting at position 2 and the vertical straight block b13 starting at position 1.

Next, we need to create the bottom part of the letter "Q" using the block types b31 and b13:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

This will create the bottom part of the letter "Q" with the vertical straight block b13 starting at position 1 and the horizontal straight block b31 starting at position 3.

Finally, let's create the loop part of the letter "Q" using the block types b31 and b11:

```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

This will create the loop part of the letter "Q" with the horizontal straight block b31 starting at position 4, followed by two square blocks b11 at position 4 and 5, then another horizontal straight block b31 starting at position 5, and finally, the last horizontal straight block b31 starting at position 6, followed by a square block b11 at position 6.

Combining all the commands together, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "Q" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```
