To generate the uppercase letter "R" using the given block types in the defined environment, we can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Places the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Places the first vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Places the second horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Places the second vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Places the third horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Places the third vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Places a square block at position 2 to complete the letter "R"
```

Note: The above sequence assumes that there are no other blocks present in the environment.
