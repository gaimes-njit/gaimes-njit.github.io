To create the letter "R," we need to stack the blocks in a specific pattern. Here are the commands to generate the letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Please note that the commands should be executed consecutively, one after the other. This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "R" within the allowed space boundaries.
