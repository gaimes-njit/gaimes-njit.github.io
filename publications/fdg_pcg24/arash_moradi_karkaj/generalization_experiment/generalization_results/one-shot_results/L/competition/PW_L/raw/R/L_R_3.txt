To create the uppercase letter "R" using the given block types and environment, you would need to follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) starting at position 2. This will form the top part of the letter "R".
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) starting at position 1. This will form the left vertical line of the letter "R".
3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) starting at position 2. This will form the right vertical line of the letter "R".
4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) starting at position 3. This will form the diagonal line of the letter "R".

The corresponding stream of commands would be:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('13',3)
