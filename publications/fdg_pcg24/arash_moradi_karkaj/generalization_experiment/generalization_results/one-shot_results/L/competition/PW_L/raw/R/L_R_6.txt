To generate the uppercase English letter "R", we can use the following stream of commands:

```markdown
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first block horizontally at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the second block horizontally at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the third block vertically at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Place the fourth block horizontally at position 6
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place the fifth block horizontally at position 9
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the sixth block vertically at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place the seventh block vertically at position 9
ab_drop('b13', 12)  # Place the eighth block vertically at position 12
ab_drop('b31', 12)  # Place the ninth block horizontally at position 12
```

This stream of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "R" in the 20x16 grid, following the stacking and gravity rules.
