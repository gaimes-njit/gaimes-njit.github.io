To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "S" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring stability and adherence to the gravity rules.

Please note that you may need to adjust the starting position or the order of the commands depending on your specific environment and game setup.
