To create the uppercase English letter "S," we need to strategically place the block types in the defined environment. The "S" shape can be formed using a combination of the horizontal straight block (b31) and the vertical straight block (b13).

Here is the sequence of commands to generate the letter "S":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the second vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the third horizontal block at position 3
```

By following these commands, you will be able to create the uppercase English letter "S" within the defined environment while maintaining structural stability.
