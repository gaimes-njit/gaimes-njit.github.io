To create the uppercase letter "T" in the Tetris-like environment, you will need to use the ab_drop() command to place each block one by one. Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "T":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

These commands will create a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1, a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 2, and three square blocks (`b11`) at positions 2, 3, and 4 to form the shape of the letter "T" in the allowed space.
