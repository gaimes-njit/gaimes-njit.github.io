To create the letter "T", we can use the following commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. The first command `ab_drop('b13', 1)` places the vertical straight block `b13` at position 1 along the width, creating the vertical line of the "T".
2. The second command `ab_drop('b31', 2)` places the horizontal straight block `b31` at position 2 along the width, intersecting with the vertical line and completing the "T" shape.

By executing these commands consecutively, we can create the uppercase English letter "T" within the defined environment.
