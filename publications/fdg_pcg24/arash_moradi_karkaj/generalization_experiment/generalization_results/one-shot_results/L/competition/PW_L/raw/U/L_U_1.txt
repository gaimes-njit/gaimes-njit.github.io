To generate the letter "U" using the ab_drop() commands, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. This will be the top of the "U" shape.
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, just below the previous block. This will be the left side of the "U" shape.
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3, next to the previous block. This will be the right side of the "U" shape.
4. Finally, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4, below the previous three blocks. This will be the bottom of the "U" shape.

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "U":

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',4)
```
