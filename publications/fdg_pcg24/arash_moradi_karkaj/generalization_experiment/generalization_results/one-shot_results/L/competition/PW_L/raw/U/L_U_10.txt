First, we need to understand the structure of the uppercase letter "U". It consists of three blocks: two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the sides and a horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle.

To construct the letter "U", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing the first vertical straight block (b13) on the left side of the grid at position 1.
2. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) right next to the first block at position 1.
3. Finally, place the second vertical straight block (b13) on the right side of the grid at position 3.

The stream of commands to generate the letter "U" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

By following these commands, we ensure that the blocks are stacked in the correct order and fit within the allowed space boundaries.
