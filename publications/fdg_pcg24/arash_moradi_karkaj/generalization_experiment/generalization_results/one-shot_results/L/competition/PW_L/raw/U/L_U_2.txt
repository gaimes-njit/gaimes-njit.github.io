To generate the uppercase English letter "U" using the block types and gravity rules, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

This stream of commands will construct the letter "U" in the defined environment while ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
