To generate the uppercase letter "U", we can use the b31 block type to create the sides of the letter and the b13 block type to create the bottom.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the "U" letter:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',6)
```

Explanation:

1. `ab_drop('b31',1)`: This command places a b31 block at position 1 along the width, which creates the left side of the "U" letter.
2. `ab_drop('b13',4)`: This command places a b13 block at position 4 along the width, which creates the bottom part of the "U" letter.
3. `ab_drop('b31',6)`: This command places a b31 block at position 6 along the width, which creates the right side of the "U" letter.

By executing these commands consecutively, you will have successfully generated the uppercase letter "U" within the defined environment.
