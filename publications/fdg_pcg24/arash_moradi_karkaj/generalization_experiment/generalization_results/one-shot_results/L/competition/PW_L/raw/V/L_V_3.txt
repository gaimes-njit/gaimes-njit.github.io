Here is a stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "V":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b11',4)
```

Please note that the numbers inside the ab_drop() function indicate the type of block and the position along the width, respectively. The commands should be executed consecutively.
