To generate the uppercase English letter "V", you can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

These commands will create a "V" shape using block types b31 and b13, with the blocks placed in the appropriate positions to resemble the target letter.
