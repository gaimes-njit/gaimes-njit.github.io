Here is a possible solution to generate the uppercase letter "V":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

Explanation:
- The first two commands `ab_drop('b31', 1)` and `ab_drop('b13', 2)` place the first vertical part of the "V" shape.
- The next two commands `ab_drop('b31', 3)` and `ab_drop('b13', 4)` place the diagonal part of the "V" shape.
- The following two commands `ab_drop('b31', 5)` and `ab_drop('b31', 6)` place the horizontal part of the "V" shape.
- Finally, the last command `ab_drop('b13', 7)` places the second vertical part of the "V" shape.

Make sure to adjust the position of the blocks and the order of the commands based on the allowed space and desired layout.
