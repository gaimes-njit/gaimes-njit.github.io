To create the uppercase letter "W", we can use a combination of the block types b31 and b13. The letter "W" consists of three vertical straight blocks (b13) and two horizontal straight blocks (b31). 

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Each command places a block of the specified type and position. By following these commands in order, you will create the uppercase letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries.
