To create the uppercase English letter "W" using the given block types and gravity rules, you need to follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 using the ab_drop() command:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Then, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 using the ab_drop() command:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Repeat the previous two steps to create the other side of the letter "W":
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

The complete set of commands to generate the letter "W" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
