To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we will need to use a combination of the three block types: b11, b31, and b13. 

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)      # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)      # Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 2)      # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 4)      # Place the vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 2)      # Place the small square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)      # Place the small square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 3)      # Place the small square block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will form the letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries and following the gravity rules.
