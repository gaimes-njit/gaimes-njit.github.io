To generate the uppercase letter "W" using the given block types, you can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width using the ab_drop() command:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width using the ab_drop() command:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

3. Repeat step 1 to add another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4 along the width:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 4)
   ```

4. Finally, repeat step 2 to add another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 along the width:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

By following these steps and executing the corresponding ab_drop() commands in order, you will generate the uppercase letter "W" in the Tetris-like environment.
