To create the letter "W" using the provided block types and environment constraints, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Next, place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Now, you need to create the first diagonal of the "W". Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4 along the width.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

4. Create the second diagonal of the "W" by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 7 along the width.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

5. Complete the letter "W" by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 10 along the width.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "W" would be:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

Please note that the streaming of commands provided above is an example and may not necessarily represent the most optimized solution.
