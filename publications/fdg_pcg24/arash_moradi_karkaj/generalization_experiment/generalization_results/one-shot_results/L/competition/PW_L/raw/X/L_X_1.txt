To generate the uppercase English letter "X", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

This sequence will construct the letter "X" by stacking and arranging the block types as required.
