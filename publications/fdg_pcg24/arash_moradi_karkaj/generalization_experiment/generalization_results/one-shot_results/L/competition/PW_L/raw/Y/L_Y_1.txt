To generate the uppercase letter "Y" using the mentioned block types and commands, you can follow the following steps:

1. Start with the first vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width: 
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

2. Stack the horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the vertical straight block at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

3. Stack the horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous block at position 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

4. Stack the second vertical straight block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

5. Stack the second vertical straight block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

6. Stack the horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous block at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

7. Stack the horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous block at position 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

8. Stack the final vertical straight block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

9. Stack the final vertical straight block (b13) on top of the previous block at position 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

This series of commands will create the uppercase letter "Y" within the defined environment and gravity rules.
