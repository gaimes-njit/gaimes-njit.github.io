To generate the uppercase letter "Y," you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "Y" while adhering to the gravity rules and the boundaries of the allowed space.
