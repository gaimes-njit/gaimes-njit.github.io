To create the uppercase letter "Z" using the given block types and commands, we need to implement the following steps:

1. Start by dropping a horizontal straight block of type 'b31' at position 2. This will form the top line of the letter "Z". The command for this step is: `ab_drop('b31',2)`.
   
2. Next, drop a vertical straight block of type 'b13' at position 1. This will form the left diagonal line of the letter "Z". The command for this step is: `ab_drop('b13',1)`.

By following these two steps in order, we can create the uppercase letter "Z" using the provided blocks and commands. The full stream of commands is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
```
