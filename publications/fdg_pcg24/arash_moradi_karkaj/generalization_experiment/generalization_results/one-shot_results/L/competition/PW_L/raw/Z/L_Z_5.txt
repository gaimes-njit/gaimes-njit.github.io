The stream of commands to generate the letter "Z" using the given block types in the defined environment is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "Z" by stacking and positioning the blocks in accordance with the gravity rules and within the allowed space boundaries.
