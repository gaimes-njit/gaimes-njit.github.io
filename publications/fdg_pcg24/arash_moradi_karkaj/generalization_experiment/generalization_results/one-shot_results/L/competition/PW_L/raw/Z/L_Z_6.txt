Here is a series of ab_drop() commands that will generate the uppercase letter "Z":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

This series of commands will first create the top horizontal line of the letter "Z", then the diagonal line, and finally the bottom horizontal line. The blocks are placed one by one, following the 2D gravity rules to ensure stability within the boundaries of the allowed space.
