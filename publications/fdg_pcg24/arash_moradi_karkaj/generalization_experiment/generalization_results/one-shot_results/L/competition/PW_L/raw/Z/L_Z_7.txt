To generate the uppercase letter "Z", we can use a combination of block types b31 and b13. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to construct the letter "Z":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)
ab_drop('b31',8)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in a way that represents the letter "Z" within the boundaries of the allowed space.
