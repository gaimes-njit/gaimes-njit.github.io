To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we need to place the blocks in a specific pattern. Here is the sequence of commands to achieve that:

```
// Place the horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 1)

// Place the diagonal block
ab_drop('b13', 4)

// Place the horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 2)

// Place the diagonal block
ab_drop('b13', 3)

// Place the horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "Z" by stacking and placing the blocks according to the given rules and boundaries.
