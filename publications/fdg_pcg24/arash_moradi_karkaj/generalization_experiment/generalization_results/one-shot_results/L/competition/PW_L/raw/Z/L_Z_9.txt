To generate the uppercase letter "Z" using the given block types and the Tetris-like environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Here's a breakdown of the commands:

1. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
2. Place a 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 4.
3. Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2.
4. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 4.
5. Finally, place the last horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3.

By following these commands, you can construct the letter "Z" within the allowed space boundaries while maintaining structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
