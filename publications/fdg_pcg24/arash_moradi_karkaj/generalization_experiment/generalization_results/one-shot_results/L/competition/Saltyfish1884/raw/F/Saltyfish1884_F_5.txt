To generate a structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all hard constraints, we can break down the task into the following steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base block (b11) at slot 9 (centered horizontally).

```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

Step 3: Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the base block, centered horizontally.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block, shifted one slot to the right.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

Step 5: Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block, shifted one slot to the left.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

Step 6: Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block, centered horizontally.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

The above steps will generate a structure that resembles the character "F" while satisfying the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. Make sure to execute the code in the correct sequence.
