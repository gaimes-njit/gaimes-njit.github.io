To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully consider the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. Here is a possible step-by-step approach:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Start by dropping a b13 block to form the vertical part of the "K" character. This block should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing:
ab_drop('b13', 2)

Step 3: Drop a b11 block on top of the b13 block to form the horizontal part of the "K" character:
ab_drop('b11', 1)

Step 4: Drop another b11 block to form the shorter horizontal part of the "K" character:
ab_drop('b11', 3)

Step 5: Drop a b13 block on top of the shorter horizontal part to complete the vertical part of the "K" character:
ab_drop('b13', 2)

Step 6: Drop a b11 block on top of the vertical part of the "K" character:
ab_drop('b11', 2)

Step 7: Drop another b11 block to form the longer horizontal part of the "K" character:
ab_drop('b11', 4)

Step 8: Drop a b13 block on top of the longer horizontal part to complete the vertical part of the "K" character:
ab_drop('b13', 2)

Step 9: Drop a b11 block on top of the vertical part of the "K" character:
ab_drop('b11', 2)

Step 10: Drop a b11 block on top of the shorter horizontal part to form the top part of the "K" character:
ab_drop('b11', 3)

Step 11: Drop a b31 block on top of the shorter horizontal part to complete the top part of the "K" character and ensure stability:
ab_drop('b31', 2)

By following the above steps, we should be able to generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K" while meeting all the given constraints.
