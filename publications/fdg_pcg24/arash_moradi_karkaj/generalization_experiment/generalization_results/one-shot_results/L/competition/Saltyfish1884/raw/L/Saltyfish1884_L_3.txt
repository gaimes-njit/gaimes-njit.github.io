To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the b13 block to form the vertical part of the "L" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Step 3: Drop the b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligning its center with the b13 block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```
Note: The b31 block needs to be dropped on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to maintain stability.

Step 4: Drop the b11 block on top of the b31 block:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

Step 5: Drop the b11 block on top of the b11 block:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```
Note: This step is optional and may vary depending on the desired height of the structure.

Step 6: Check the stability and adjust the dropping positions if needed. Make sure that the blocks are placed as low as possible and the structure is not separated.

This step-by-step approach will generate a stable structure resembling the character "L" while meeting all hard constraints. You can modify the dropping positions and order to create different structures based on your requirements.
