To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) to form the stable base of the structure. These blocks should cover slots 0 and 19 to ensure stability.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Place a vertical block at the leftmost slot for stability
ab_drop('b13', W-1)  # Place a vertical block at the rightmost slot for stability
```

3. Drop the blocks to form the middle parts of the "M" structure. Start by placing a b31 block on top of the vertical blocks to form the first stroke of the "M". This block should be dropped at a lower layer to reduce the risk of collapsing.

```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)  # Place a horizontal block at the middle slot for the first stroke of "M"
```

4. Place the remaining blocks to complete the structure. Drop the blocks representing the lower parts of the "M" stroke first to maintain stability.

```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 1)  # Place a horizontal block at the left of the middle slot for the second stroke of "M"
ab_drop('b31', W//2 + 1)  # Place a horizontal block at the right of the middle slot for the third stroke of "M"
```

5. Drop the blocks representing the upper parts of the "M" stroke. These blocks can be dropped at higher layers since they don't impact stability as much.

```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2 - 1)  # Place a vertical block above the left stroke for the upper part of "M"
ab_drop('b13', W//2 + 1)  # Place a vertical block above the right stroke for the upper part of "M"
```

6. Finally, visualize the generated structure by printing each row of the grid.

```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Please note that the code provided above is pseudocode and assumes that the ab_drop() function is properly implemented. The exact positions and order of block placements may vary based on the specific implementation of the ab_drop() function and the desired shape of the "M" structure.
