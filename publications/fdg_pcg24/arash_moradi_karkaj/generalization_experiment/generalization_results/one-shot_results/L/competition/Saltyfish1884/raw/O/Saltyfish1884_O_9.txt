To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "O" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
W = 20  # Width of the map
H = 16  # Height of the map

structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Since the b31 block must be placed on a solid base, let's start by placing a b31 block on the bottom layer (layer 0) starting from slot 2:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Now, we need to add support to the b31 block to prevent overhangs. We can do this by placing two b13 blocks on both sides of the b31 block at the same layer (layer 0):
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Left-side b13 block
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Right-side b13 block
```

4. Next, we need to place b11 blocks above the base layer to form the sides of the "O" structure. We can start at layer 1 and place b11 blocks in slots 1 and 3 to create the left and right sides:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Left-side b11 block
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Right-side b11 block
```

5. To complete the "O" structure, we need to place two b13 blocks above the b11 blocks at layer 2. These will be the top and bottom parts of the inner circle of the "O" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Inner-top b13 block
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Inner-bottom b13 block
```

6. Finally, to avoid any boundary intrusion, we can place b11 blocks on the outer edges of the structure. We can place them at layers 1 and 2 in slots 0 and 4, respectively:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)  # Left-edge b11 block
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Right-edge b11 block
```

By following these steps and executing the `ab_drop()` function with the corresponding block type and slot, we can generate a stable structure resembling the character "O" that meets all the given constraints.

Note: The exact sequence of dropping the blocks might differ based on the random nature of the `ab_drop()` function, but as long as the steps mentioned above are followed, a stable structure resembling the character "O" will be produced.
