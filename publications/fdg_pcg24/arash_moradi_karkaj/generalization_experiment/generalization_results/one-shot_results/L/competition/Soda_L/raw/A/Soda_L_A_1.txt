To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "A", we can first build the base of the letter using a row block and then place two column blocks on top to form the sides of the letter. Here's the complete implementation:

```
# Place the base of the letter A
ab_drop("b31", 9)
# Place the left side of the letter A
ab_drop("b13", 7)
# Place the right side of the letter A
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

This implementation will create a structure that resembles the letter "A" when viewed from the top-down orientation. Each block is placed in a way that ensures stability and avoids any boundary intrusion.

Note: The code assumes that the ab_drop() function handles the stability and boundary intrusion checks internally.
