To create the letter "A", we can break it down into three blocks: a top bar, a middle block, and a bottom bar. 

First, we can drop the top bar:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
This will place the top bar at the 10th column, which is the center of the grid. 

Next, we can drop the middle block:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
This will place the middle block at the 10th column, just below the top bar.

Finally, we can drop the bottom bar:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
This will place the bottom bar at the 10th column, just below the middle block.

The complete implementation to create the letter "A" is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
