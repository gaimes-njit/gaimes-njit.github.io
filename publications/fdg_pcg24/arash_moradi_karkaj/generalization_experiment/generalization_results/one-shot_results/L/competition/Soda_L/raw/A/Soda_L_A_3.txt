First, let's create the base of the letter "A" by using two row blocks:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

Next, let's add the slanting lines of the letter "A" by using column blocks:

```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```

Now, let's add the horizontal bar of the letter "A" by using a row block:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Finally, let's add the top point of the letter "A" by using a square block:

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
