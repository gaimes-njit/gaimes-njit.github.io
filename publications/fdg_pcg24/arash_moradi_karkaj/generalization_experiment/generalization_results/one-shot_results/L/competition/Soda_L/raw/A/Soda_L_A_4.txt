To create the letter "A" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into three blocks: the top bar, the middle bar, and the bottom bar. Here is the implementation:

1. Place the bottom bar:
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 9)
   ```

2. Place the middle bar:
   ```
   ab_drop("b31", 9)
   ```

3. Place the top bar:
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 8)
   ```

By following these steps, we can create a stable structure that resembles the letter "A".
