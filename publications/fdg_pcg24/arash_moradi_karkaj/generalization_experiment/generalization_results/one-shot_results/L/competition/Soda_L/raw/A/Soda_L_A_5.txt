To generate a structure that looks like the letter "A", we can start by building the base of the letter and then adding the two diagonal lines. 

Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Build the base of the "A":
```
# Bottom horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)
# Top horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

2. Add the left diagonal line of the "A":
```
# Left diagonal bar
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

3. Add the right diagonal line of the "A":
```
# Right diagonal bar
ab_drop("b13", 14)
```

And that's it! The above implementation will generate a structure that looks like the letter "A".
