To build the letter "A" in the given level, we can start by placing the middle horizontal bar of the "A" using a row block (b31). Let's first center this block on the grid at x_position = 9.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we can place the two vertical bars of the "A" using square blocks (b11). We will place one bar on each side of the previously placed horizontal bar. Let's first place the bar on the left side at x_position = 7.

```
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```

And finally, let's place the bar on the right side of the horizontal bar at x_position = 11.

```
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```

This series of ab_drop() calls will generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "A" and ensures stability.
