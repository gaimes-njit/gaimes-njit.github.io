Based on the given hints, we can start by building the top-down orientation of the letter "A" using two row blocks and one column block. Then, we can flip the letter anti-clockwise 90 degrees to achieve better stability. 

Here is the complete implementation to build the letter "A":

```python
# Build the top part of the letter A (two row blocks)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

# Build the bottom part of the letter A (one column block)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This implementation creates the letter "A" in the bottom-to-top fashion, with the bottom block being placed first. It ensures stability by balancing the blocks and creates a structure that resembles the letter "A".
