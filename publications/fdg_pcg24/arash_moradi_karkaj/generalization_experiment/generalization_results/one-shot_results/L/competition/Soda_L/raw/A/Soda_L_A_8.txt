To create the structure of the letter "A" in the level, we can break it down into three parts: the top bar, the left slant, and the right slant.

First, we need to place the top bar. The top bar consists of a row block (b31) that is centered at the top of the grid. We can use the ab_drop() function to drop the block in the center of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we can place the left slant. The left slant consists of a column block (b13) that is centered at the middle-left of the grid. We can use the ab_drop() function to drop the block in the appropriate position.

```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```

Finally, we can place the right slant. The right slant is a mirror image of the left slant and consists of a column block (b13) that is centered at the middle-right of the grid. We can use the ab_drop() function to drop the block in the appropriate position.

```
ab_drop("b13", 14)
```

The complete implementation to create the structure of the letter "A" in the level is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
```
