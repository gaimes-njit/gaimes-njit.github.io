To build the capital letter "A", we can break it down into three blocks: the top bar, the middle bar, and the base bar. We will drop these blocks one by one and make sure they are stable and resemble the letter "A". 

Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the top bar:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Drop the middle bar:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

3. Drop the base bar:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

By following these steps, we will have a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "A".
