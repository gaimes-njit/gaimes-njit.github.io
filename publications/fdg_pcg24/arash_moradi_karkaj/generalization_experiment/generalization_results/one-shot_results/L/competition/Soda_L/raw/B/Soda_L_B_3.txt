Here is the complete implementation for generating a structure that looks like the capital letter "B" in the Tetris game:

```
# Create the vertical left part of the letter B
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

# Create the horizontal bar of the letter B
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# Create the bottom tick of the letter B
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This implementation creates the vertical left part of the letter B using two row blocks. Then it creates the horizontal bar of the letter B using three column blocks. Finally, it creates the bottom tick of the letter B using three row blocks. This arrangement ensures the best stability and similarity to the target letter B.
