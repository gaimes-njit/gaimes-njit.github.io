To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "B" using the given ab_drop() function and following the bottom-to-top approach, we can break it down into three steps:

Step 1: Create the base of the "B" shape
To create the base, we will drop a column block ("b13") at the center of the grid and place a square block ("b11") just above it. This will form the lower part of the letter "B".

ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

Step 2: Create the top-right part of the "B" shape
To create the top-right part, we will drop a row block ("b31") at the center-right of the grid and place a column block ("b13") to the left of it. This will form the upper-right diagonal part of the letter "B".

ab_drop("b31", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 12)

Step 3: Create the top-left part of the "B" shape
To create the top-left part, we will drop a row block ("b31") at the center-left of the grid and place a column block ("b13") to the right of it. This will form the upper-left diagonal part of the letter "B".

ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)

Complete Implementation:

ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
