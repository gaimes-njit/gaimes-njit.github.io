To create the letter "B" in the level, we can break it down into multiple blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation to create the "B" shape:

1. Create the base of the letter "B" using two row blocks ("b31") stacked vertically:
```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

2. Create the upper left part of the letter "B" using a column block ("b13") and a square block ("b11"):
```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

3. Create the upper right part of the letter "B" using a square block ("b11") and a row block ("b31"):
```
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

With these steps, you should have a structure in the level that resembles the letter "B" (when viewed from the top). The blocks are dropped in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
