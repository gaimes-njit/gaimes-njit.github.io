To build the letter "B" in a level, we can break it down into three blocks: a square block for the top part, a column block for the middle part, and a row block for the bottom part. 

To start, we'll place the square block on top. We can center it at position 6:

ab_drop("b11", 6)

Next, we'll place the column block for the middle part. We can center it at position 6 as well:

ab_drop("b13", 6)

Finally, we'll place the row block for the bottom part. We can center it at position 6 as well:

ab_drop("b31", 6)

Overall, the complete implementation to build the letter "B" in the level would be:

ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
