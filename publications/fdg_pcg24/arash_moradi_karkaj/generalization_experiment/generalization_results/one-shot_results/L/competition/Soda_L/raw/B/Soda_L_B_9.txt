The first step is to create the base of the letter "B". Since "B" is made of two parts - a vertical bar and a horizontal bar - we need to drop two blocks in the correct positions.

```
# Drop the vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 5)
# Drop the horizontal bar as the base
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```

Now we have the basic shape of the letter "B", but it is not stable yet. We need to add support to make it balanced.

```
# Add support to the vertical bar
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
# Add support to the horizontal bar
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
```

This completes the structure of the letter "B". Testing the stability and similarity of the generated structure will ensure the best quality of the implementation.

```
# Test stability and similarity (not included in the final code block)
# Verify if the structure is stable and looks like the letter "B"
# ...
```

The complete implementation (contains no indentation and only ab_drop() calls) to generate the letter "B" structure in the level:

```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
```
