To generate a structure that looks like the letter "C" in the given level, we can start by placing a vertical pipe block at the center of the grid. Then, we can add two row blocks on either side of the vertical pipe to complete the shape of the letter "C". 

Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the vertical pipe block at the center of the grid:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Place a row block on the left side of the vertical pipe:

```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

3. Place another row block on the right side of the vertical pipe:

```
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will create a structure in the level that looks like the letter "C" (TARGET), with the best stability and similarity.
