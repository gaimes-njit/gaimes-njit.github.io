In order to create a structure that looks like the letter "C" in the Tetris game, we will need to strategically drop blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the base of the "C" using a row block (b31) at the center of the grid.
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
This will create the bottom portion of the "C" shape.

2. Drop the vertical bar of the "C" using a column block (b13) at the center of the grid, one row above the base.
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
This will create the middle portion of the "C" shape.

3. Drop the top curve of the "C" using a square block (b11) at the center-right of the grid, one row above the vertical bar.
```
ab_drop("b11", 12)
```
This will create the top portion of the "C" shape.

By following these steps, we will generate a structure that resembles the letter "C" in the Tetris game.
