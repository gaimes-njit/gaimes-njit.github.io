To create a structure in the shape of the letter "C" using the given blocks and functions, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a row block ("b31") at the bottom of the grid to serve as the base of the letter "C". We can center it at column 6.
2. Next, place a column block ("b13") on top of the base, starting at row 1 to create the vertical part of the letter "C". We can center it at column 6 as well.
3. Lastly, place another row block ("b31") on top of the vertical part of the letter "C", starting at row 5. This will complete the circular part of the letter "C". Again, center it at column 6.

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
