To create a structure that looks like the letter "C", we can follow the hints provided and break it down into multiple blocks. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Drop the first block "b13" vertically from the top and center it at position x=8:
ab_drop("b13", 8)

Step 2: Drop the second block "b13" vertically from the top and center it at position x=9:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

Step 3: Drop the third block "b13" vertically from the top and center it at position x=8:
ab_drop("b13", 8)

Step 4: Drop the fourth block "b13" vertically from the top and center it at position x=9:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

Step 5: Drop the fifth block "b31" vertically from the top and center it at position x=6:
ab_drop("b31", 6)

Step 6: Drop the sixth block "b31" vertically from the top and center it at position x=6:
ab_drop("b31", 6)

Step 7: Drop the seventh block "b31" vertically from the top and center it at position x=6:
ab_drop("b31", 6)

Step 8: Drop the eighth block "b11" vertically from the top and center it at position x=7:
ab_drop("b11", 7)

Step 9: Drop the ninth block "b11" vertically from the top and center it at position x=7:
ab_drop("b11", 7)

Step 10: Drop the tenth block "b11" vertically from the top and center it at position x=7:
ab_drop("b11", 7)

Step 11: Drop the eleventh block "b11" vertically from the top and center it at position x=8:
ab_drop("b11", 8)

Step 12: Drop the twelfth block "b11" vertically from the top and center it at position x=8:
ab_drop("b11", 8)

Step 13: Drop the thirteenth block "b11" vertically from the top and center it at position x=8:
ab_drop("b11", 8)

Step 14: Drop the fourteenth block "b11" vertically from the top and center it at position x=9:
ab_drop("b11", 9)

Step 15: Drop the fifteenth block "b11" vertically from the top and center it at position x=9:
ab_drop("b11", 9)

Step 16: Drop the sixteenth block "b11" vertically from the top and center it at position x=9:
ab_drop("b11", 9)

This series of ab_drop() calls will create a structure that looks like the letter "C" and is stable.
