The first step is to create the bottom part of the "C" shape. We can achieve this by dropping a "b13" block at the bottom-left corner of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

The next step is to create the vertical part of the "C" shape. We can achieve this by dropping a "b31" block centered at the second column of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

To complete the "C" shape, we need to drop another "b13" block centered at the third column of the grid, just above the vertical part.

```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

Finally, we can add some stability to the structure by adding two more "b13" blocks on top of the vertical part, centered at the second and third column.

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```
