To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "C" (TARGET), we can break it down into three separate blocks: a vertical pipe, a bottom bar, and a top bar. We will create each block individually and place them in the appropriate positions to form the "C" shape.

Step 1: Create the vertical pipe
To create the vertical pipe, we will use a "b31" block. We will drop it in position (9,0) to form the left side of the "C".

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9) 
```

Step 2: Create the bottom bar
To create the bottom bar, we will use a "b13" block. We will drop it in position (8,0) to connect with the bottom of the vertical pipe and form the base of the "C".

```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Step 3: Create the top bar
To create the top bar, we will use a "b13" block. We will drop it in position (8,2) to connect with the top of the vertical pipe and complete the "C" shape.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Complete Implementation:
The complete implementation to generate a "C" shape using the ab_drop() function is as follows:

```python
# Create the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 9) 

# Create the bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 8) 

# Create the top bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

This implementation will generate a structure that resembles the capital letter "C" and is stable under gravity.
