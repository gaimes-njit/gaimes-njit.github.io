To create the letter "D" using the given ab_drop() function, we can follow the following steps:

1. Place a row block "b31" at the bottom-left corner of the grid.
2. Place a column block "b13" one cell to the right and centered vertically.
3. Place a column block "b13" one cell to the right and centered vertically.

This arrangement will form the letter "D" in the level.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the base of the letter "D" (b31 at the bottom-left corner)
ab_drop("b31", 0)

# Place the vertical part of the letter "D" (b13 at x_position=2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)

# Place the vertical part of the letter "D" (b13 at x_position=4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```

This arrangement will create the letter "D" in the level and ensure stability.
