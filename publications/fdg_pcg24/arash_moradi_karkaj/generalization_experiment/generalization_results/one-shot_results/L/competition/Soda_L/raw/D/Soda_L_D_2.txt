The first step is to create the base of the letter "D" using a row block (b31). Since the width of the grid is 20, we can place the row block at x_position=9 to ensure that it is centered. 

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to add the straight vertical part of the letter "D" using a column block (b13). We can place the column block above the base of the letter "D" at x_position=9 to align it with the center of the base.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, we need to add the curved part of the letter "D". To achieve this, we can use two square blocks (b11) placed strategically to form a curve shape. We need to place the first square block above the upper half of the base at x_position=8 and the second square block above the upper half of the column at x_position=7.

```python
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```

The complete implementation to generate a structure in a level that looks like a capital character "D" is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```
