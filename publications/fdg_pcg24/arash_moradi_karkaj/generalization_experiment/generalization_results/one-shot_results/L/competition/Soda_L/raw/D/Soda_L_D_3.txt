For the letter "D", we can break it down into three blocks: a square block for the top, a row block for the middle, and a column block for the bottom.

Here is the implementation to generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital "D" using the ab_drop() function:

``` python
# Drop the top block
ab_drop("b11", 5)

# Drop the middle row block
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# Drop the bottom column block
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

This implementation creates a stable structure that resembles the letter "D" when viewed in the natural top-down orientation.
