To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital character "D", we can use the 'b31' and 'b13' block types. 

We will start by creating the left vertical part of the "D" using the 'b31' block type. We will center it at x_position=5 to match the appearance of the letter "D". 

Then, we will create the base of the "D" using the 'b13' block type. We will center it at x_position=5 as well, so that it connects to the vertical part. 

Finally, we will create the upper right part of the "D" using the 'b31' block type. We will center it at x_position=7. 

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Create the left vertical part of the "D" (b31 block)
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# Create the base of the "D" (b13 block)
ab_drop("b13", 5)

# Create the upper right part of the "D" (b31 block)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This implementation will generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "D" and ensures stability by following the bottom-to-top stacking order.
