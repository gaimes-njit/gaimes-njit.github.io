To create the letter D, we can break it down into three parts: the vertical pipe, the middle bar, and the bottom bar.

First, we need to create the vertical pipe. We can do this by dropping a "b31" block at the desired position.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

Next, we need to create the middle bar. We can do this by dropping a "b11" block above the vertical pipe.

```python
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Finally, we need to create the bottom bar. We can do this by dropping a "b13" block below the vertical pipe.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 15)
```

Putting it all together, here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Create the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# Create the middle bar
ab_drop("b11", 10)

# Create the bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 15)
```

This implementation will create a structure that resembles the capital letter "D" in the level.
