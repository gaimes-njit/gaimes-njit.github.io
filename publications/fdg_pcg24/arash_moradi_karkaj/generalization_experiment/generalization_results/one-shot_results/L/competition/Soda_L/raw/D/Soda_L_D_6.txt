To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "D" while ensuring stability and similarity, we can break it down into several blocks and carefully position them in the level. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Create the base of the "D" shape:
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at x_position=0.
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at x_position=1.
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at x_position=2.
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at x_position=3.
   
   ```
   ab_drop("b31", 0)
   ab_drop("b31", 1)
   ab_drop("b31", 2)
   ab_drop("b31", 3)
   ```

2. Create the vertical stroke of the "D" shape:
   - Drop a column block ("b13") at x_position=4.
   - Drop a column block ("b13") at x_position=5.
   - Drop a column block ("b13") at x_position=6.
   
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 4)
   ab_drop("b13", 5)
   ab_drop("b13", 6)
   ```

3. Create the top bar of the "D" shape:
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at x_position=7.
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at x_position=8.
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at x_position=9.
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at x_position=10.
   
   ```
   ab_drop("b31", 7)
   ab_drop("b31", 8)
   ab_drop("b31", 9)
   ab_drop("b31", 10)
   ```

4. Create the gap in the "D" shape:
   - Drop a square block ("b11") at x_position=4.

   ```
   ab_drop("b11", 4)
   ```

5. Create stability by reinforcing the structure:
   - Drop a square block ("b11") at x_position=2.
   - Drop a square block ("b11") at x_position=3.
   - Drop a square block ("b11") at x_position=6.
   
   ```
   ab_drop("b11", 2)
   ab_drop("b11", 3)
   ab_drop("b11", 6)
   ```

6. Verify the stability and similarity of the generated structure by visually inspecting the level. If any blocks seem unstable or the shape does not resemble a capital "D" well, adjust the positions of the blocks as needed.

The complete implementation will be the sequence of ab_drop() calls from steps 1 to 6:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)  # Base of "D"
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Vertical stroke of "D"
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)  # Top bar of "D"
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 4)  # Gap in "D"
ab_drop("b11", 2)  # Stability reinforcement
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
```

This implementation creates a stable structure resembling the capital letter "D" in the level.
