First, let's start by creating the vertical pipe of the letter D.

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

Next, let's create the base of the letter D.

```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

Finally, let's create the top-right bend of the letter D.

```
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```

This series of steps will generate a structure that resembles the letter D on the 2D grid. Please note that the stability and similarity of the structure may vary depending on factors such as the presence of other blocks and the implementation of gravity.

Complete implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```
