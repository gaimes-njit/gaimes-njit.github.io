First, we need to create the vertical left part of the letter E. We can achieve this by dropping a "b31" block at x_position=0. 

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

Next, we need to create the horizontal middle part of the letter E. We can achieve this by dropping a "b13" block at x_position=1. 

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

Finally, we need to create the vertical right part of the letter E. We can achieve this by dropping another "b31" block at x_position=2. 

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

The complete implementation that ensures stability and similarity is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```
