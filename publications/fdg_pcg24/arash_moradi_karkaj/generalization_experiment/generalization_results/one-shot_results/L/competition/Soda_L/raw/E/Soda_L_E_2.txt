To create the letter "E" in a stable and similar manner, we can break it down into three blocks: a vertical bar, a horizontal bar, and a middle bar. Here is the code implementation:

```
# The vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 4)

# The horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 3)

# The middle bar
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

This code will drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability. The resulting structure will resemble the letter "E".
