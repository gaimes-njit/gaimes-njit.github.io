To create a structure that looks like the letter E, we can break it down into three parts: the top bar, the middle bar, and the bottom bar. We will drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. Here's the code to create the E structure:

```
# Drop the bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 8)

# Drop the middle bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 8)

# Drop the top bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

The above code will create the letter E structure, with each block properly aligned to form the desired shape. The stability of the structure is ensured by building it from the bottom to the top.
