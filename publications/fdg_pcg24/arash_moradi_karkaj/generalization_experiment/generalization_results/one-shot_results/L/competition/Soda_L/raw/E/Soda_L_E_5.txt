To create the letter E in a stable and similar manner, we can break it down into three parts: the top bar, the middle bar, and the bottom bar.

First, we will drop the top bar. We can use a row block (b31) centered at column 9 to create the top bar.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Next, we will drop the middle bar. We can use a column block (b13) centered at column 8 to create the middle bar.

ab_drop("b13", 8)

Finally, we will drop the bottom bar. We can again use a row block (b31) centered at column 9 to create the bottom bar.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # top bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # middle bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # bottom bar
```
