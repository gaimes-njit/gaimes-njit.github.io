To generate the letter "E" in the level, we can start by creating the two vertical bars. Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Create the vertical left part of the E
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 4)

# Create the base of the E
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# Create the horizontal bar of the E
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

This implementation creates a stable structure that resembles the letter "E".
