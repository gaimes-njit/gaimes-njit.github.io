To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "E", we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Create the base of the letter "E" with a row block ("b31") placed at the center of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 2: Create the top bar of the letter "E" with a column block ("b13") placed to the right of the base block.

```
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

Step 3: Create the middle bar of the letter "E" with a column block ("b13") placed below the top bar and to the right of the base block.

```
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

Step 4: Create the bottom bar of the letter "E" with a column block ("b13") placed below the middle bar and to the right of the base block.

```
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

Complete Implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```
