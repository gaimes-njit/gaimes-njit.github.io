Here is the complete implementation of the code:

```python
# Place the base
ab_drop("b13", 2)

# Place the top-left bar
ab_drop("b31", 2)

# Place the middle bar
ab_drop("b31", 2)

# Place the bottom-left bar
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

This implementation creates a stable structure in the shape of the letter "E" using the ab_drop() function. Each block is carefully placed in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. The resulting structure will resemble the letter "E" when viewed from the top-down orientation.
