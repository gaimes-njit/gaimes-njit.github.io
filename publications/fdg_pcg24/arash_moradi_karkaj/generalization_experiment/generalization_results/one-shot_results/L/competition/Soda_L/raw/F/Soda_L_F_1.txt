Based on the given hints, we need to create a structure in the shape of the letter "F" using the ab_drop() function.

The first step is to create the base of the "F". We can use a row block (b31) centered at position 9.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the vertical pipe of the "F". We can use a column block (b13) centered at position 10.

```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Finally, we need to create the top bar of the "F". We can use another row block (b31) centered at position 10.

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

The complete implementation would be:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
