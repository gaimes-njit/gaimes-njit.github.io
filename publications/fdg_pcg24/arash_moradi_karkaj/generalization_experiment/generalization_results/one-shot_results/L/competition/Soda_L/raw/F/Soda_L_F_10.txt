To create the letter F, we can break it down into three blocks: a vertical pipe, a top bar, and a middle bar.

First, we will drop the vertical pipe:
ab_drop("b31", 4)

Next, we will drop the top bar:
ab_drop("b13", 3)

Finally, we will drop the middle bar:
ab_drop("b13", 5)

The complete implementation to generate the letter "F" in the most stable and similar way is as follows:

```
# Drop the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 4)
# Drop the top bar
ab_drop("b13", 3)
# Drop the middle bar
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```
