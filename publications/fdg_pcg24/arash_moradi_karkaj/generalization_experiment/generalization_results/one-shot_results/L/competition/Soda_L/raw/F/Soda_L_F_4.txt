The first step is to create the base of the "F" structure. We can use the "b13" block at x-position 5 to create the bottom bar.

```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

Next, we need to create the vertical pipe of the "F" structure. We can use the "b31" block at x-position 5 to create the pipe.

```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

Finally, we can create the top bar of the "F" structure using the "b13" block at x-position 4.

```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```

The complete implementation for creating a structure that looks like the capital letter "F" is as follows:

```
# Create the bottom bar of the "F"
ab_drop("b13", 5)

# Create the vertical pipe of the "F"
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# Create the top bar of the "F"
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```
