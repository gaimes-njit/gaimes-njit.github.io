To build the letter "F" in the level, we can use the following steps:

1. Place the top bar of the "F":
   - Drop a horizontal row block ("b31") at the center of the grid (x_position = 10).

```python
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

2. Place the vertical pipe of the "F":
   - Drop a column block ("b13") below the top bar, at the center-left of the grid (x_position = 9).

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

3. Place the bottom bar of the "F":
   - Drop a horizontal row block ("b31") below the vertical pipe, at the center of the grid (x_position = 10).

```python
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

The complete implementation to build the letter "F" in the level would be:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
