To create the letter "F" in the level, we will first create the vertical left part of the letter and then place the base below it.

Here is the code to create the letter "F":

```
# The vertical left part
ab_drop("b31", 10)
# The base
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This code will drop the "b31" block at x_position=10, creating the vertical left part of the letter. Then, it will drop the "b13" block at x_position=9, creating the base of the letter.
