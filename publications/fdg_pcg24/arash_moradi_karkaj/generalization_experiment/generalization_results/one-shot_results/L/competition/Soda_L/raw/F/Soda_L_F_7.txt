To create the capital letter "F" in the level with the given constraints, we can start by placing the base of the letter first and then adding the vertical bar.

Here is the complete implementation to create the letter "F":

ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place the base of the letter F
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the vertical bar of the letter F

This implementation drops a block with the type "b13" at position x=9 to create the base of the letter F. Then, it drops a block with the type "b31" at the same position x=9 to create the vertical bar of the letter F. The blocks are placed from bottom to top to ensure stability.
