To create the letter F using bottom-to-top construction, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the base of the F
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Step 2: Place the vertical line of the F
```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Step 3: Place the horizontal line of the F
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

The complete implementation to generate the letter F is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

This implementation ensures that each block is dropped in a bottom-to-top fashion, providing stability to the structure. The resulting structure will resemble the letter F.
