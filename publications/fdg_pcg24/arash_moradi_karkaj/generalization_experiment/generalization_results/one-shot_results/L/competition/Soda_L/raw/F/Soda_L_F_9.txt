To create the letter "F" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: a vertical bar, a horizontal bar, and a short bar. We will place the blocks from bottom to top to ensure stability. Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the base horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 5)

# Place the vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 4)

# Place the short bar
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "F".
