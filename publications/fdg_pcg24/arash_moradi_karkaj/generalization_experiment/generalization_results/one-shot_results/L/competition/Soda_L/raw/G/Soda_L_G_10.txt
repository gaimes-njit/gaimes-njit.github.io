To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "G" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can break it down into three blocks: the top horizontal bar, the middle vertical bar, and the bottom horizontal bar.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# First, let's create the top horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)   # Place a block at x_position=8 (centered in column 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)   # Place a block at x_position=9

# Next, let's create the middle vertical bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)   # Place a block at x_position=8 (centered in column 9)
ab_drop("b13", 7)   # Place a block at x_position=7 (centered in column 8)
ab_drop("b13", 6)   # Place a block at x_position=6 (centered in column 7)
ab_drop("b13", 5)   # Place a block at x_position=5 (centered in column 6)
ab_drop("b13", 4)   # Place a block at x_position=4 (centered in column 5)

# Finally, let's create the bottom horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)   # Place a block at x_position=8 (centered in column 9)
ab_drop("b11", 7)   # Place a block at x_position=7

# The structure should now resemble the letter "G"
```

Note that the positions and order of the `ab_drop()` calls are crucial to ensure both stability and similarity to the target character. By following this sequence, we can create a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "G".
