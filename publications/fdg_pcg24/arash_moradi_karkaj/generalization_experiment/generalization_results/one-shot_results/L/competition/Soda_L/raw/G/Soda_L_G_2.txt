To generate a structure that looks like the character "G," we can break it down into different blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve that:

1. Place the base of the "G" using two row blocks:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

2. Place the middle section of the "G" using a column block and a row block:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

3. Place the upper section of the "G" using a column block and two row blocks:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 12)

ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)

ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

This implementation ensures stability by placing the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, and it creates a structure that looks like the character "G".
