To create the letter "G" in the given level, we can break it down into multiple blocks and stack them together in a bottom-to-top fashion. We will use the given tool `ab_drop()` to drop the blocks at the desired positions. 

Here is the step-by-step implementation to create the letter "G":

1. First, we will create the base of the "G" using two row blocks (`b31`). We will drop them at positions (5, 0) and (15, 0) to create a stable base.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 15)
```

2. Next, we will create the upper part of the "G" using a column block (`b13`). We will drop it at position (15, 2) to form the vertical part.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 15)
```

3. Finally, we will create the top bar of the "G" using a row block (`b31`). We will drop it at position (0, 4) to complete the letter shape.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

The complete implementation to create the letter "G" in the level is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 15)
ab_drop("b13", 15)
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```
