The first step is to create the middle bar of the capital letter "G". We can do this by dropping a row block at the center of the grid.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the top portion of the "G". We can do this by dropping a column block to the left of the middle bar, and a row block on top of it.

```python
# Vertical left part
ab_drop("b13", 8)
# Top bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Finally, we need to create the bottom portion of the "G". We can do this by dropping a column block to the right of the middle bar, and a row block on top of it.

```python
# Vertical right part
ab_drop("b13", 10)
# Bottom bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The complete implementation to generate a structure that looks like a capital "G" is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
