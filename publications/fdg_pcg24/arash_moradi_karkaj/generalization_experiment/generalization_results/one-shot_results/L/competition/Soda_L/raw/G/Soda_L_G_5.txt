The first step is to build the vertical part of the letter G. We can achieve this by dropping a column block (b13) with center pivot at x_position=2:
```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

The second step is to build the horizontal bar of the letter G. We can achieve this by dropping a row block (b31) with center pivot at x_position=1:
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

The third step is to build the bottom part of the letter G. We can achieve this by dropping a square block (b11) with center pivot at x_position=3:
```
ab_drop("b11", 3)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation is as follows:
```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
```
