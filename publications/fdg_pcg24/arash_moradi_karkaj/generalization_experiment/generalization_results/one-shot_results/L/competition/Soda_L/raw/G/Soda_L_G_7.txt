To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "G", we can break it down into three blocks - the main body, the top horizontal bar, and the bottom vertical bar. 

Step 1: Place the main body block
We can start by placing the main body block, which is a square block of size 1*1. We will place it at the bottom-left corner of the grid.

ab_drop("b11", 0)

Step 2: Place the top horizontal bar
Next, we can place the top horizontal bar, which is a row block of size 3*1. We will place its center pivot point at the fifth column of the grid.

ab_drop("b31", 4)

Step 3: Place the bottom vertical bar
Finally, we can place the bottom vertical bar, which is a column block of size 1*3. We will place its center pivot point at the fifth column of the grid.

ab_drop("b13", 4)

The complete implementation to generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "G" is as follows:

ab_drop("b11", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
