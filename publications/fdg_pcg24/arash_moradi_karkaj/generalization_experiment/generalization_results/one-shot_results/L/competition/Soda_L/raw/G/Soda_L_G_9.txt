To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "G" in the Tetris game, we can use the hints given to form the shape. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Creating the base of the "G"

```
# Create the base block
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Step 2: Creating the upper part of the "G"

```
# Create the horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)
# Create the vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 8)
# Create the top-right corner
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```

Step 3: Creating the middle part of the "G"

```
# Create the horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 7)
# Create the bottom-right corner
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```

Step 4: Creating the lower part of the "G"

```
# Create the horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 6)
# Create the vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 6)
# Create the bottom-right corner
ab_drop("b11", 6)
```

Step 5: Creating the base support for stability

```
# Create the base support
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

This completes the implementation of the structure that looks like the capital letter "G". The blocks are placed in a way that ensures stability and maximizes the similarity to the target character "G".
