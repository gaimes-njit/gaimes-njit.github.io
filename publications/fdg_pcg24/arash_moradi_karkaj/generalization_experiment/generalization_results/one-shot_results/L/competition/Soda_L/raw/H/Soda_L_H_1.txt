First, let's create the base of the "H" character by placing a row block in the center of the grid:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, let's add the two vertical bars of the "H" character by placing two column blocks on either side of the base:

```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

Finally, let's add the horizontal bar of the "H" character by placing a row block on top of the vertical bars:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
