To generate a structure in the Tetris game that looks like the letter "H", we can follow these steps:

1. Drop the bottom bar of the "H":
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
2. Drop the vertical left part of the "H" on top of the bottom bar:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
3. Drop the vertical right part of the "H" on top of the bottom bar:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Complete implementation:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```
