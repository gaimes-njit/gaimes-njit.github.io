To create the letter "H" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: one vertical pipe and two horizontal bars. We will build the structure from bottom to top.

Here is the complete implementation to create the letter "H":

```
# Place the first horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 6)

# Place the vertical pipe on top of the first horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 6)

# Place the second horizontal bar on top of the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

This implementation starts by placing the first horizontal bar at x_position=6. Then, the vertical pipe is placed on top of the first horizontal bar, also at x_position=6. Finally, the second horizontal bar is placed on top of the vertical pipe at x_position=6.

This implementation ensures that the structure is stable and resembles the letter "H" when viewed from the top.
