To create a structure that looks like the letter "H", we can first create the two vertical bars, and then place a horizontal bar in between them. Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 7)  # Left vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 12)  # Right vertical bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Horizontal bar

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "H" on the grid.
