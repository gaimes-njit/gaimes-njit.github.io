To generate the letter H in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical bars and one horizontal bar. They can be placed in the following order:

1. Place the first vertical bar at the leftmost position:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

2. Place the horizontal bar aligning with the top of the first vertical bar:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

3. Place the second vertical bar aligning with the top of the horizontal bar:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

So, the complete implementation to generate the letter H in the level is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```
