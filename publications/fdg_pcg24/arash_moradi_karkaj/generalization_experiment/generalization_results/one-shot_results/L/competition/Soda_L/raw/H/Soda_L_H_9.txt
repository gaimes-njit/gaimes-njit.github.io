First, let's start by creating the base of the "H" character using two row blocks:

ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)

Next, let's add the vertical bar of the "H" character using a column block:

ab_drop("b13", 9)

Finally, let's add the top bar of the "H" character using a row block:

ab_drop("b31", 7)

The complete implementation is as follows:

ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
