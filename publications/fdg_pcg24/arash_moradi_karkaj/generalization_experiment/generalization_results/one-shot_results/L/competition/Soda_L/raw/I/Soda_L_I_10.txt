To create the letter "I", we can start by dropping a row block in the center of the grid. This will serve as the base of the structure.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Next, we can drop a square block above the base. This will form the top part of the "I".

ab_drop("b11", 9)

Finally, we can drop another row block above the top part to complete the structure.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete implementation for creating the letter "I" is as follows:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
