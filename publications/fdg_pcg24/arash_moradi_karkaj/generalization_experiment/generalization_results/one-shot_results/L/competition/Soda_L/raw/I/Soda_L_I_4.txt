Here is the complete implementation to generate a structure resembling the letter "I" in the Tetris game:

```python
# Step 1: Place the base of the letter "I"
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Step 2: Place the vertical pipe of the letter "I"
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Step 3: Place the top bar of the letter "I"
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This code will drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, starting with the base of the letter "I" and proceeding upwards to form the complete structure. The blocks are placed at specific x-positions to ensure the correct alignment of the letter "I". The stability of the structure is maintained by balancing the blocks and ensuring they are well-supported.
