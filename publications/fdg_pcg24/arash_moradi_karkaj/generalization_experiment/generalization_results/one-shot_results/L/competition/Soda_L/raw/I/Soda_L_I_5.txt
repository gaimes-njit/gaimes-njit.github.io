To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "I", we can start by dropping the base block (b13) centered at position 9. This will create a stable foundation for the structure.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, we can drop two vertical blocks (b11) centered at positions 9 and 10, respectively. These blocks will form the two vertical lines of the "I" character.

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Finally, we can drop another base block (b13) centered at position 9 on top of the existing structure. This will complete the "I" character.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
