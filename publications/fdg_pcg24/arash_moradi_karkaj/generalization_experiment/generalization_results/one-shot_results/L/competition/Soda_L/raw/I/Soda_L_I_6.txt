To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "I", we need to stack two blocks vertically. The first block will be a row block ("b31") placed at the center position, and the second block will be a square block ("b11") placed on top of the row block. Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Place the row block at the bottom
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Place the square block on top of the row block
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

This implementation ensures that both blocks are balanced and well-supported, meeting the stability constraint. The resulting structure will resemble the letter "I" when evaluated for similarity.
