To create a structure that resembles the capital letter "I" in the level, we can start by placing a row block ("b31") at the bottom center of the grid. This will form the base of the "I" shape.

Next, we can place a column block ("b13") directly above the base block, centered horizontally. This will form the vertical line of the "I" shape.

Finally, we can place another row block ("b31") above the vertical line block, centered horizontally. This will complete the "I" shape.

The code implementation to achieve this is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # Place base block
ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Place vertical line block
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # Place top block
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are placed bottom-to-top and are well-supported, resulting in a stable structure. Additionally, the resulting structure will resemble the capital letter "I" when evaluated for similarity.
