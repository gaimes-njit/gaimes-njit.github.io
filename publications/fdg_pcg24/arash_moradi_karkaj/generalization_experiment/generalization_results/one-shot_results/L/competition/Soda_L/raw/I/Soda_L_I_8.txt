To generate the capital letter "I" in the level, we can use the following code:

```
# Bottom block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
# Middle block
ab_drop("b31", 10)
# Top block
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

This code will place three row blocks vertically on top of each other at the center of the grid. This will create a structure that looks like the capital letter "I".
