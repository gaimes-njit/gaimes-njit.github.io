To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "I", we can start by placing a column block ("b13") at the center of the grid. This will serve as the base for the letter.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, we can place two row blocks ("b31") on top of the column block, aligned with each other and centered.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Finally, we can place a square block ("b11") on top of the two row blocks, also aligned with them and centered.

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

The complete implementation to create the letter "I" is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
