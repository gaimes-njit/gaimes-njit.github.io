In order to generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "J", we can break it down into three blocks: the top bar, the middle pipe, and the bottom tick. We will stack these blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.

Here is the complete implementation to create the J shape:

```python
# Drop the bottom tick
ab_drop("b31", 17)
ab_drop("b11", 17)

# Drop the middle pipe
ab_drop("b13", 18)

# Drop the top bar
ab_drop("b13", 19)
ab_drop("b11", 18)
ab_drop("b11", 17)
```

This implementation starts by dropping the bottom tick of the J shape, centered at column 17. Then, a square block is placed on top of the bottom tick for stability.

Next, the middle pipe is dropped, centered at column 18. 

Finally, the top bar is created by stacking three blocks. Two square blocks are placed at columns 17 and 18, and a third square block is placed on top at column 19. 

This arrangement creates a stable structure that resembles the letter J.
