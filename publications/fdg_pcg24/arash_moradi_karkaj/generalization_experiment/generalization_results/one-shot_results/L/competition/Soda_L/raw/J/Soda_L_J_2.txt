To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "J", we can break it down into three parts: the top bar, the middle pipe, and the bottom tick. We will create each part separately and then combine them to form the final J shape.

Step 1: Creating the top bar
To create the top bar, we will use a row block (b31) and position it at the center of the grid horizontally. We will drop it at the topmost row to create the top bar.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 2: Creating the middle pipe
To create the middle pipe, we will use a column block (b13) and position it at the center of the grid horizontally. We will drop it just below the top bar, at a row that is two rows below the topmost row.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Step 3: Creating the bottom tick
To create the bottom tick, we will use a column block (b13) and position it at the center of the grid horizontally. We will drop it three rows below the topmost row.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Combining all the steps, the complete implementation to create a J shape is as follows:

```python
# Creating the top bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Creating the middle pipe
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Creating the bottom tick
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This implementation will create a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "J".
