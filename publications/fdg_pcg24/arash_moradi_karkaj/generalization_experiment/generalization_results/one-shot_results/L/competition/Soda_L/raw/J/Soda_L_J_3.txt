To generate a structure that looks like the letter J, we can follow the hints given. The J character consists of a top bar, a middle pipe, and a bottom tick. We will create the structure from bottom to top.

First, we will create the bottom tick using a column block (b13) positioned at the center of the grid:

ab_drop("b13", 9)

Next, we will create the middle pipe using a row block (b31) positioned just above the bottom tick:

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Finally, we will create the top bar using a column block (b13) positioned just above the middle pipe:

ab_drop("b13", 9)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
