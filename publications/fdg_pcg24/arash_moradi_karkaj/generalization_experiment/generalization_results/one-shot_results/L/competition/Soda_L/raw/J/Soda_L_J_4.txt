To build the letter J, we can start by placing the base block, followed by the middle pipe, and finally the top bar.

```
# Place the base block
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Place the middle pipe
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# Place the top bar
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will generate a structure that resembles the letter J. Keep in mind that the order in which the blocks are placed is crucial to maintain stability.
