```
# Step 1: Create the top bar
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# Step 2: Create the middle pipe
ab_drop("b13", 6)

# Step 3: Create the bottom tick
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```

The above code block creates a structure that looks like the capital letter "J" in the level. The blocks are dropped in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. The top bar is created first, followed by the middle pipe, and finally the bottom tick.
