Here is a step-by-step implementation to create a structure in the shape of the letter "J" with the ab_drop() function:

1. First, we need to create the top bar of the letter "J". We can use the "b31" block to achieve this. We will drop it at position 9, which will center it horizontally in the grid. 

ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Next, we need to create the middle pipe of the letter "J". We can also use the "b31" block for this. We will drop it at position 9, which is the same position as the top bar.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

3. Finally, we need to create the bottom tick of the letter "J". We can use the "b13" block for this. We will drop it at position 8, which will center it horizontally in the grid.

ab_drop("b13", 8)

The complete implementation to create a structure in the shape of the letter "J" is as follows:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
