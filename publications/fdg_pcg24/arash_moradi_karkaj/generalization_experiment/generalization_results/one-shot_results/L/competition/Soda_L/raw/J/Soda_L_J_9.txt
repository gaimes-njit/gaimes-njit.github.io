To generate a structure that looks like the capital character "J" (TARGET), we can follow the hints given in the question. 

First, we need to create the top bar of the "J" shape. Since the "J" shape has a width of 3, we can use the "b31" block type and place it at the appropriate x position to center the block. 

Next, we need to create the middle pipe of the "J" shape. Again, we can use the "b31" block type and place it vertically beneath the top bar. 

Finally, we need to create the bottom tick of the "J" shape. We can use the "b13" block type and place it horizontally beneath the middle pipe to complete the "J" shape. 

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Create the top bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Create the middle pipe
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Create the bottom tick
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

This implementation will generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital character "J" and ensures stability by following the block-stacking techniques.
