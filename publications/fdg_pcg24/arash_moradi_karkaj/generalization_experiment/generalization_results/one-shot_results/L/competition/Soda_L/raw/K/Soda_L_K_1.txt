First, we will start building the base of the letter "K". In this case, the base consists of a row block and two column blocks. We will place the row block in the middle and the two column blocks on either side.

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Place the row block
ab_drop("b13", 3)  # Place the left column block
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Place the right column block
```

Next, we will build the middle part of the letter "K". This consists of two row blocks stacked on top of each other and placed between the two column blocks from the base.

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Place the top row block
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Place the bottom row block
```

Finally, we will build the top part of the letter "K". This consists of a square block placed on top of the middle row block.

```
ab_drop("b11", 4)  # Place the top square block
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to generate a structure in the level that looks like the letter "K" is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Place the row block (base)
ab_drop("b13", 3)  # Place the left column block (base)
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Place the right column block (base)

ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Place the top row block (middle)
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Place the bottom row block (middle)

ab_drop("b11", 4)  # Place the top square block (top)
```
