To generate the letter "K" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: the vertical pipe, the top bar, and the bottom bar. Here is the implementation:

1. Place the vertical pipe block:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Place the top bar block:
```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

3. Place the bottom bar block:
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

By following these steps, we can generate a structure in the level that looks like the letter "K" and ensures stability by balancing the blocks.
