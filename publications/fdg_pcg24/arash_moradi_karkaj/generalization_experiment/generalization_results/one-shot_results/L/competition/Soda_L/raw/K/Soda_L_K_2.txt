To create the letter "K" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical bars and a diagonal bar. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the base block:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

2. Place the left vertical bar:
ab_drop("b31", 7)

3. Place the right vertical bar:
ab_drop("b31", 11)

With these three blocks, we have successfully created the letter "K" in the level.
