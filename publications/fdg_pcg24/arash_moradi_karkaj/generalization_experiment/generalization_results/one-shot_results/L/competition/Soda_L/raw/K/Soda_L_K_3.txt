To build the capital letter "K" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: the vertical stroke, the horizontal stroke, and the diagonal stroke.

First, we will place the vertical stroke:

```
# Place the vertical stroke
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

Next, we will place the horizontal stroke, which will be supported by the vertical stroke:

```
# Place the horizontal stroke
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

Finally, we will place the diagonal stroke, which will be supported by the vertical and horizontal strokes:

```
# Place the diagonal stroke
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

With these three blocks in place, we should have a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "K".

Complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```
