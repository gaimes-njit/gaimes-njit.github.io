To create the letter "K" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks - the two vertical pipes and one diagonal bar. We will start by placing the vertical pipes and then add the diagonal bar on top.

Here is the code to create the letter "K":

```
# Place the left vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 8)

# Place the right vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 11)

# Place the diagonal bar on top
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This code will create the letter "K" in the level. Make sure to follow the order of placement and the provided parameters for stability and similarity.
