To create the letter "K" using Tetris blocks, we can break it down into three blocks - a column block in the middle and two row blocks on either side. Here is the implementation:

```
# Place the left row block
ab_drop("b31", 6)
# Place the middle column block
ab_drop("b13", 9)
# Place the right row block
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top approach, dropping the blocks from the top and creating a stable structure.
