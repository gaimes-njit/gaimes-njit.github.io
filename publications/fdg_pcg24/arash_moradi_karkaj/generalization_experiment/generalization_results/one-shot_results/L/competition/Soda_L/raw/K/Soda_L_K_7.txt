In order to create the letter "K" in the Tetris game, we can break it down into several blocks and drop them in a specific order. 

First, let's start with the left vertical part of the letter "K":
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, let's add the horizontal bar at the bottom of the letter "K":
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Now, let's add the diagonal part of the letter "K":
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Finally, let's add the vertical right part of the letter "K":
```
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Left vertical part of "K"
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Bottom horizontal bar of "K"
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Diagonal part of "K"
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Diagonal part of "K"
ab_drop("b31", 12)  # Right vertical part of "K"
```

This implementation will create a structure in the level that looks like the letter "K". Make sure to drop the blocks in the specified order and position to ensure stability and similarity.
