To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "K", we can use the hints provided to drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. Let's break down the process into steps and build the structure gradually:

Step 1: Drop the base of the "K". We can use the row block "b31" for this:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 2: Add the vertical line of "K". We can use the column block "b13" for this:
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Step 3: Add the diagonal line of "K". We can use the column block "b13" for this as well:
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

The complete implementation to generate a "K" structure would look like this:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

By following these steps, we can create a structure that resembles the capital letter "K" in the Tetris game.
