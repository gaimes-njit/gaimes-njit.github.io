To build the capital letter "K" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can break it down into three blocks: two corner blocks and one middle block. We will start by building the base of the "K" and then add the corner blocks on top. 

Here's the code for building the "K" structure:

```
# Base block
ab_drop("b13", 7) 
# Left corner block
ab_drop("b31", 2) 
# Right corner block
ab_drop("b31", 12) 
```

Explanation:
1. We start by dropping a column block ("b13") on the 7th column. This forms the base of the "K".
2. Next, we drop a row block ("b31") on the 2nd column to create the left corner of the "K".
3. Finally, we drop another row block ("b31") on the 12th column to create the right corner of the "K".

This code will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "K" in the level.
