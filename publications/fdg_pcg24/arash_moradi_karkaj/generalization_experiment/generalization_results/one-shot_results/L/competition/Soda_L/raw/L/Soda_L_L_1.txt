To generate the letter "L" in the level, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() calls:

```
# The vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 10)
# The bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This sequence first drops the vertical pipe block centered at x_position 10, and then drops the bottom bar block centered at x_position 9.

To ensure stability, the vertical pipe block should be placed before the bottom bar block because the bottom bar block will provide support for the vertical pipe block.

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
# The vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 10)
# The bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This implementation will generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "L" and is stable.
