To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "L", we can follow the hints provided. We will first drop the vertical pipe and then the bottom bar.

```python
# Drop the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 10)
# Drop the bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will create a structure in the shape of the letter "L" in the level. The vertical pipe block will be placed at x=10 and the bottom bar block will be placed at x=9.
