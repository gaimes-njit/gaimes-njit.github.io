To create the target letter "L" using the ab_drop() function, we need to drop two blocks: a vertical pipe and a bottom bar. Here is the complete implementation:

```
# The vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 10)
# The bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This implementation will create a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "L". Make sure to execute these commands in the order given to achieve the desired result.
