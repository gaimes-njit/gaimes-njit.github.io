Here is the complete implementation to generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "L":

```
# Place the vertical left part of the L
ab_drop("b31", 10)
# Place the bottom bar of the L
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

These two ab_drop() calls will create the structure of the capital letter "L" in the level.
