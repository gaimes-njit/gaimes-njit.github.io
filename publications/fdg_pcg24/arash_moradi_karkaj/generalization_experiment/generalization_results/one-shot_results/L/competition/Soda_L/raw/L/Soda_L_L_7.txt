The first step is to create the base of the "L" shape. We can achieve this by dropping a "b13" block centered at the bottom of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

The next step is to create the vertical part of the "L" shape. We can achieve this by dropping a "b31" block centered on top of the base block.

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

With these two blocks, we have successfully created a structure that looks like the capital letter "L". The implementation above ensures stability and similarity to the target shape.
