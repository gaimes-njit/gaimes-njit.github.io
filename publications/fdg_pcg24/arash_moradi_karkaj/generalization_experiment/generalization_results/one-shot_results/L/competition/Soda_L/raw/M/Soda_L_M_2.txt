First, let's create the left vertical part of the letter "M" by dropping a "b31" block centered at the 5th column:
```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

Next, let's create the middle diagonal part of the letter "M" by dropping a "b13" block centered at the 9th column:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, let's create the right vertical part of the letter "M" by dropping another "b31" block centered at the 13th column:
```
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```

Complete implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```
