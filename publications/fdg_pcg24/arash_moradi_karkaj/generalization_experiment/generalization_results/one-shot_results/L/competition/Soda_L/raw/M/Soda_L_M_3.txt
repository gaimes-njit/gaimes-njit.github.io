To generate the letter "M" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two column blocks and one row block. Here is the complete implementation:

# The left column of the "M"
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 6)

# The right column of the "M"
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# The middle row of the "M"
ab_drop("b31", 8)
