In order to build a structure that looks like the letter "M", we can break it down into three blocks: the left diagonal, the middle vertical, and the right diagonal. We can build each block from bottom to top to ensure stability. 

Here is the code to build the left diagonal of the "M":
```
ab_drop("b31", 7)    # bottom block of the left diagonal
ab_drop("b13", 6)    # middle block of the left diagonal
ab_drop("b31", 5)    # top block of the left diagonal
```

Next, we can build the middle vertical block of the "M":
```
ab_drop("b11", 4)    # bottom block of the middle vertical
ab_drop("b13", 3)    # top block of the middle vertical
```

Finally, we can build the right diagonal of the "M":
```
ab_drop("b31", 2)    # bottom block of the right diagonal
ab_drop("b13", 1)    # middle block of the right diagonal
ab_drop("b31", 0)    # top block of the right diagonal
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 7)    # bottom block of the left diagonal
ab_drop("b13", 6)    # middle block of the left diagonal
ab_drop("b31", 5)    # top block of the left diagonal

ab_drop("b11", 4)    # bottom block of the middle vertical
ab_drop("b13", 3)    # top block of the middle vertical

ab_drop("b31", 2)    # bottom block of the right diagonal
ab_drop("b13", 1)    # middle block of the right diagonal
ab_drop("b31", 0)    # top block of the right diagonal
```
