To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "M", we can break it down into three blocks - the two side bars and the middle peak.

Since the blocks should be placed in a bottom-to-top fashion, we will start by placing the base of the M, which is a row block "b31" at position 7:
```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

Next, we will place the two side bars of the M, which are column blocks "b13". We will place one column block on the left side and another on the right side of the base row block. We can choose positions 6 and 8 for the left and right side bars, respectively:
```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Finally, we will place the peak of the M, which is a square block "b11". We will place it at the top center position, which is index 9:
```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

The complete implementation to generate an M structure is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
