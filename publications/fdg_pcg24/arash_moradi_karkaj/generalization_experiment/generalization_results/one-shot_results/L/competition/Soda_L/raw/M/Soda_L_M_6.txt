Here's the code to generate a structure that looks like the letter 'M' in the level:

```
# Place the left vertical line of the 'M'
ab_drop("b31", 7)
# Place the top bar of the 'M'
ab_drop("b13", 6)
# Place the inverted 'V' of the 'M'
ab_drop("b13", 8)
# Place the bottom bar of the 'M'
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

This code will create a stable structure that resembles the letter 'M'.
