To generate a structure that looks like the letter "M", we can break it down into three blocks - the two slanted sides and the middle bar. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place the first slanted side:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

2. Place the middle bar:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```

3. Place the second slanted side:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 15)
```

This implementation creates a stable structure that looks like the letter "M".
