First, let's create the left vertical part of the letter M. We can use block "b31" and place it at the leftmost position (x_position = 0).

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

Next, let's create the right vertical part of the letter M. Again, we can use block "b31" and place it at the rightmost position (x_position = 19).

```
ab_drop("b31", 19)
```

Now, let's create the middle part of the letter M. We can use block "b13" and place it at the center position (x_position = 9).

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, let's create the base of the letter M. Again, we can use block "b13" and place it at the center position (x_position = 9).

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
