First, let's start building the base of the "N" by dropping a row block:

ab_drop("b31", 4)

Next, we'll stack a column block on top of the row block to form the vertical part of the "N":

ab_drop("b13", 4)

Finally, we'll place another row block on top of the column block to complete the "N":

ab_drop("b31", 4)
