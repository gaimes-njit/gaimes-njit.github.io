To build the capital letter "N" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can break it down into three parts - the left vertical pipe, the diagonal, and the right vertical pipe. Here's how we can construct it:

1. Build the left vertical pipe:
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at the center (x_position=9).
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at the center (x_position=11).

2. Build the diagonal:
   - Drop a column block ("b13") at the center (x_position=10).
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at the center (x_position=11).

3. Build the right vertical pipe:
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at the center (x_position=12).
   - Drop a row block ("b31") at the center (x_position=14).
  
Here's the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```

This implementation will give us a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "N" in the top-down orientation.
