To generate a structure that looks like the letter "N" in Tetris, we can break it down into three blocks - two vertical pipes and one horizontal bar. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Drop the first vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 8)

Step 2: Drop the horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)

Step 3: Drop the second vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 10)

This implementation will create a structure in the level that resembles the letter "N".
