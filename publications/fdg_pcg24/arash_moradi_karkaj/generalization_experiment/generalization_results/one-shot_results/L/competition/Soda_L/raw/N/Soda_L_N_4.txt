To generate the letter "N" in the level, we can first create the two vertical bars and then the horizontal bar connecting them. Here's the code to achieve that:

```
# The left vertical bar
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# The horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This code will create a structure that resembles the letter "N" in the initial orientation. The blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability, and the columns and rows are coordinated to form the desired shape.
