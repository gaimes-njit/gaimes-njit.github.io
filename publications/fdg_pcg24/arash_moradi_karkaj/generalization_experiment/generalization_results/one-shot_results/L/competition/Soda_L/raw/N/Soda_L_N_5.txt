To generate the letter "N" in the level, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the left vertical line of the "N":
   ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Left vertical line
   ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Left vertical line
   ab_drop("b31", 10) # Left vertical line

2. Place the diagonal line of the "N":
   ab_drop("b13", 11) # Diagonal line
   ab_drop("b13", 10) # Diagonal line
   ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Diagonal line
   ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Diagonal line

3. Place the right vertical line of the "N":
   ab_drop("b31", 7)  # Right vertical line
   ab_drop("b31", 6)  # Right vertical line
   ab_drop("b31", 5)  # Right vertical line

By following these steps, we will create a stable structure that looks like the letter "N" when the level reaches structural stability.
