To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "N," we will start by placing the base of the N first. Then, we will place two vertical bars on either side of the base to complete the letter shape. 

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Step 1: Place the base of the N
ab_drop("b13", 7)  # Place the base of the N at x_position 7

# Step 2: Place the vertical bars of the N
ab_drop("b31", 3)  # Place the left vertical bar of the N at x_position 3
ab_drop("b31", 11)  # Place the right vertical bar of the N at x_position 11
```

This implementation will generate a structure in the shape of the letter "N" on the 2D grid.
