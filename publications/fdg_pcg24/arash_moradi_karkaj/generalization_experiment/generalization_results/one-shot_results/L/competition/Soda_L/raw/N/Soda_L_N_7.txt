To generate the letter "N" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two column blocks and a row block. We will start building the structure from the bottom and work our way up.

1. Place the first column block at the bottom-left corner:
```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

2. Place the row block on top of the first column block:
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

3. Place the second column block on top of the row block, shifted to the right:
```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

This series of ab_drop() calls will generate a structure that resembles the letter "N".
