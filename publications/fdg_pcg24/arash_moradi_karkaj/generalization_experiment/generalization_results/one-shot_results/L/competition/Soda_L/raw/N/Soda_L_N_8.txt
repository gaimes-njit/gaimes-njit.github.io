To create the letter N in the level, we need to drop the blocks in a specific order and position to ensure stability. Here is the step-by-step approach to creating the letter N:

1. Place the bottom bar of the N:
   ab_drop("b13", 5)

2. Place the left vertical part of the N:
   ab_drop("b31", 7)

3. Place the right vertical part of the N:
   ab_drop("b31", 13)

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```
