In this task, our goal is to create a structure that looks like the capital letter "N" using the given ab_drop() function. We need to carefully choose the drop positions and order of the blocks to ensure stability and similarity to the target.

To create the letter "N", we can break it down into three parts - two vertical pipes and one diagonal bar connecting them. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Create the left vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 2)

Step 2: Create the diagonal bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)

Step 3: Create the right vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 16)

This implementation starts by creating the left vertical pipe at position x=2. Then it creates the diagonal bar connecting the two pipes at position x=9. Finally, it creates the right vertical pipe at position x=16.

This implementation ensures stability by placing the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, where each block is well-supported by the blocks below it. It also resembles the letter "N" when viewed from the top-down orientation.

Complete Implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 16)
