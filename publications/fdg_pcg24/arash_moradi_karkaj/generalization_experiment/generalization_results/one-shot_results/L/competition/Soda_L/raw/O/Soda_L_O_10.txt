To create the letter "O" in the level, we can start by dropping a row block ("b31") at the center of the level. This will create the bottom part of the letter "O".

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we can drop a column block ("b13") above the row block to complete the upper part of the letter "O".

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, to enforce stability, we can drop a square block ("b11") above the column block.

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

The complete implementation to create the letter "O" in the level with the best stability and similarity is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
