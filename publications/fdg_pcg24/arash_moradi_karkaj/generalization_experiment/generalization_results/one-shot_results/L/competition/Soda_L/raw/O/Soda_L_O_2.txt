To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "O", we can use a combination of row blocks and column blocks. Here is the complete implementation:

1. Place the bottom row of the "O":
```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

2. Place the top row of the "O":
```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

3. Place the left column of the "O":
```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

4. Place the right column of the "O":
```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

5. Place the top-left corner square block of the "O":
```
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

6. Place the top-right corner square block of the "O":
```
ab_drop("b11", 6)
```

7. Place the bottom-left corner square block of the "O":
```
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

8. Place the bottom-right corner square block of the "O":
```
ab_drop("b11", 6)
```

This series of ab_drop() calls will generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "O". It ensures stability by placing blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, and it enforces similarity by creating the desired shape.
