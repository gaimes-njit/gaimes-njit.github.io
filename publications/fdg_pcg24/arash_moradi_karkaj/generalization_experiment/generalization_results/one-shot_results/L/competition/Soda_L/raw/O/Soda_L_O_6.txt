To create the letter "O", we can start by placing a row block in the middle of the grid. This will serve as the base for the letter.

ab_drop("b31", 9) 

Next, we can place a column block on top of the row block to form the vertical sides of the letter.

ab_drop("b13", 9) 

Finally, we can place two square blocks on top of the column block to complete the letter.

ab_drop("b11", 8) 
ab_drop("b11", 10) 

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 9) 
ab_drop("b13", 9) 
ab_drop("b11", 8) 
ab_drop("b11", 10)
