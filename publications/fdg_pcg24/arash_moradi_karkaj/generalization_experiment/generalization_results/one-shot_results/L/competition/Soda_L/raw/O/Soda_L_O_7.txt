To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "O", we can start by placing a row block at the bottom center of the grid. Following the given hints, we can create the letter "O" by placing additional blocks on top of the base block.

Here is the step-by-step implementation to create the letter "O":

Step 1: Place the base block (a row block) at the bottom center of the grid.
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 2: Place three column blocks above the base block to form the sides of the "O".
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Step 3: Place row blocks on top of the column blocks to form the top and bottom of the "O".
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Step 4: Place two square blocks on top to complete the "O".
```
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Complete implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```
