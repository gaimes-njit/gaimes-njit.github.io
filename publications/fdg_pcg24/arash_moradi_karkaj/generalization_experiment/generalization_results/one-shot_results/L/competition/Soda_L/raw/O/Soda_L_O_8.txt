First, let's build the base of the O shape by dropping a row block at the bottom with a center position at column 9.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, let's drop a column block on the left side of the base at column 8.

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Finally, let's drop another column block on the right side of the base at column 10.

```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```
