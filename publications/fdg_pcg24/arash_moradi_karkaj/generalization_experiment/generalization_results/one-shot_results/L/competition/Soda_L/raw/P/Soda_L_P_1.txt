To create a structure in the shape of the letter "P", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the vertical line of the "P":
```
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```
2. Place the horizontal line of the "P" above the vertical line:
```
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```
3. Place another vertical line of the "P" to the right of the existing vertical line:
```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```
4. Place the top part of the vertical line of the "P":
```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```
5. Place the bottom part of the vertical line of the "P":
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

The complete implementation to create the letter "P" in a stable and similar manner is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```
