To create the letter "P" using the ab_drop() function, we will need to drop two blocks. One block will be a vertical pipe and the other block will be a horizontal bar at the bottom.

Here is the implementation to create the letter "P":

```python
# Drop the vertical pipe block
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Drop the horizontal bar block
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

The first ab_drop() call drops the vertical pipe block (b31) at x_position 9. This will create a vertical pipe shape in the grid.

The second ab_drop() call drops the horizontal bar block (b13) at x_position 8. This will create a horizontal bar shape at the bottom of the vertical pipe, completing the letter "P".

This implementation ensures stability by starting from the bottom and building upwards. The resulting structure will resemble the letter "P".
