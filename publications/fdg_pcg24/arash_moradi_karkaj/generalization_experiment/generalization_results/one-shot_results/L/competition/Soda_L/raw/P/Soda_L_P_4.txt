To build the letter P in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can break it down into two blocks - a vertical pipe and a horizontal bar.

To create the vertical pipe, we will use the "b31" block type and drop it centered at position 10. This will occupy cells (9, 0), (10, 0), and (11, 0).

Next, we will create the horizontal bar using the "b13" block type and drop it centered at position 9. This will occupy cells (8, 1), (9, 1), and (10, 1).

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Create the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# Create the horizontal bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
