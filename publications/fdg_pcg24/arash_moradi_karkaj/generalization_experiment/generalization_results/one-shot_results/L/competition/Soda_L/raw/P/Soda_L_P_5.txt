To create a capital letter "P" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: 
1. The vertical left part of the letter "P" 
2. The base of the letter "P" 
3. The top bar of the letter "P"

To create the vertical left part of the letter "P", we can use a "b31" block and center it at a specific x-position. For example, if we place it at x_position=5, it will occupy cells (4, 0), (5, 0), and (6, 0). 

Next, we can create the base of the letter "P" using a "b13" block. We will center it at a specific x-position, and place it one row above the bottom row to leave space for the vertical left part. For example, if we place it at x_position=5, it will occupy cells (4, 1), (5, 1), and (6, 1). 

Finally, we can create the top bar of the letter "P" using a "b13" block. We will center it between the vertical left part and the base, and place it one row above the base. For example, if we place it at x_position=5, it will occupy cells (4, 2), (5, 2), and (6, 2). 

Below is the complete implementation to create a capital letter "P":

```
# Create the vertical left part of the letter "P"
ab_drop("b31", 5)

# Create the base of the letter "P"
ab_drop("b13", 5)

# Create the top bar of the letter "P"
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

This implementation ensures stability as each block is dropped in a bottom-to-top fashion, and it creates a structure that resembles the capital letter "P" in the level.
