To build the letter 'P' in a bottom-to-top fashion, we will start by placing the base. Then, we will add the vertical line on the left side. Finally, we will add the top horizontal line. Here is the code to generate the letter 'P':

```python
# Step 1: Place the base
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Step 2: Add the vertical line on the left side
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Step 3: Add the top horizontal line
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

This code will generate a structure that resembles the letter 'P' and ensures stability. It follows the hints provided in the problem description to create the desired shape.
