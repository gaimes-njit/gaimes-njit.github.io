To create the letter "P", we can use the following steps:

1. Drop a row block "b31" at x_position = 1 to form the top part of the letter.
2. Drop a column block "b13" at x_position = 0 to form the vertical line of the letter.
3. Drop a column block "b13" at x_position = 2 to form the bottom part of the letter.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Drop the top part of the letter "P"
ab_drop("b31", 1)

# Drop the vertical line of the letter "P"
ab_drop("b13", 0)

# Drop the bottom part of the letter "P"
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```
