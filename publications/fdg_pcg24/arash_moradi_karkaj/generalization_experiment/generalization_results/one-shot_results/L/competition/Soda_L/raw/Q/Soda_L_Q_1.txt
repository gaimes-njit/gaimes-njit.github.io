To generate the capital letter "Q" in the level, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the base block:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

2. Place the left vertical bar:
```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

3. Place the top horizontal bar:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

4. Place the right vertical bar:
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

With these steps, we have constructed the letter "Q" in the level. The blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.
