Here is a step-by-step implementation to generate a structure in the shape of the letter "Q" using the ab_drop() function. Each step will be explained and shown as a code block:

Step 1: Create the base of the letter "Q"
```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```
- This will create a column block with a size of 1 * 3 and place it at x_position=7 to form the base of the letter "Q".

Step 2: Create the top-right corner of the letter "Q"
```
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```
- This will create a square block with a size of 1 * 1 and place it at x_position=8 to form the top-right corner of the letter "Q".

Step 3: Create the vertical bar of the letter "Q"
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
- This will create a row block with a size of 3 * 1 and place it at x_position=9 to form the vertical bar of the letter "Q".

Step 4: Create the top-left corner of the letter "Q"
```
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```
- This will create a square block with a size of 1 * 1 and place it at x_position=10 to form the top-left corner of the letter "Q".

Step 5: Create the bottom-left corner of the letter "Q"
```
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```
- This will create a square block with a size of 1 * 1 and place it at x_position=11 to form the bottom-left corner of the letter "Q".

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```
