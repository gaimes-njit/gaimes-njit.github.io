To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "Q", we will use a combination of square blocks and column blocks. This will ensure stability and similarity to the target character. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the base of the "Q" using a column block (b13) at the bottom center of the grid:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Step 2: Place a square block (b11) above the base block to form the upper-left corner of the "Q":
```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Step 3: Place a square block (b11) to the right of the upper-left corner block to form the top bar of the "Q":
```
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Step 4: Place a column block (b13) to the right of the top bar block to form the right vertical line of the "Q":
```
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

Step 5: Place a square block (b11) below the right vertical line block to form the bottom-right corner of the "Q":
```
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```

Step 6: Place a column block (b13) below the bottom-right corner block to extend the right vertical line of the "Q":
```
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

Step 7: Place a square block (b11) to the left of the bottom-right corner block to extend the bottom line of the "Q":
```
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Step 8: Place a column block (b13) to the left of the bottom line block to form the left vertical line of the "Q":
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Step 9: Place a square block (b11) above the left vertical line block to complete the "Q":
```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

The complete implementation:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
