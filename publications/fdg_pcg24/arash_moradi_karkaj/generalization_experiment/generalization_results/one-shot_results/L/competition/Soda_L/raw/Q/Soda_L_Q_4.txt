First, let's start by creating the base for the letter "Q". Since "Q" consists of a square block and a column block, we can drop them in the following order:

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # The column block
ab_drop("b11", 9)   # The square block
```

Next, let's add the upper part of the letter "Q". To create a stable structure, we'll need to add a row block and a square block. We can achieve this by dropping the blocks in the following order:

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # The row block
ab_drop("b11", 9)   # The square block
```

Finally, let's add the tail of the letter "Q". This can be done by dropping a row block and a square block in the following order:

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # The row block
ab_drop("b11", 9)   # The square block
```

This completes the implementation. The final code block should look like this:

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
