To create the letter Q, we can divide it into four blocks: a square block for the dot, a row block for the top bar, a column block for the middle bar, and another row block for the bottom bar.

Here is the complete implementation to generate the letter Q in the level:

```
# Place the dot
ab_drop("b11", 13)

# Place the top bar
ab_drop("b31", 12)

# Place the middle bar
ab_drop("b13", 13)

# Place the bottom bar
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

By following these steps, you will generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "Q".
