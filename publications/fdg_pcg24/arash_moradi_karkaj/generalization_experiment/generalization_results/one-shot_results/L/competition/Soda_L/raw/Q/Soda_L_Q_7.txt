To generate the "Q" shape, we can break it down into three blocks: the top bar, the middle bar, and the bottom-right corner.

Here is the complete implementation to generate the "Q" shape:

1. Place the top bar:
ab_drop("b13", 8)

2. Place the middle bar:
ab_drop("b13", 8)

3. Place the bottom-right corner:
ab_drop("b11", 8)

Overall, the three blocks will form the "Q" shape when viewed from top to bottom with the given orientations.
