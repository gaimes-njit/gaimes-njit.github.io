To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "Q", we can start by building the base of the letter and then adding the stem and tail. The code below shows the step-by-step implementation:

```
# Step 1: Build the base
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# Step 2: Build the stem
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Step 3: Build the tail
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

In step 1, we first drop a row block ("b31") centered at x_position=9 to create the horizontal base of the letter "Q". Then, we drop a column block ("b13") centered at x_position=8 to create the vertical part of the base.

In step 2, we drop another column block ("b13") centered at x_position=9 to create the stem of the letter "Q".

In step 3, we add the tail of the letter "Q". We first drop a row block ("b31") centered at x_position=9 to extend the base. Then, we drop a column block ("b13") centered at x_position=10 to create the vertical part of the tail. Finally, we drop a row block ("b31") centered at x_position=11 to finish the tail. We also add a square block ("b11") centered at x_position=10 to complete the structure.

This implementation ensures stability and creates a structure that resembles the capital letter "Q".
