To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "Q", we will need to place blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. We can divide the structure into three main parts: the base, the tail, and the loop.

1. Base:
The base of the "Q" will be a row block (b31) placed at the bottom of the grid. We will center it at column 9.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Tail:
The tail of the "Q" will be a column block (b13) placed above the base block. We will center it at column 8.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

3. Loop:
The loop of the "Q" will be a square block (b11) placed above the tail block. We will center it at column 9.
```python
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Complete implementation:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
