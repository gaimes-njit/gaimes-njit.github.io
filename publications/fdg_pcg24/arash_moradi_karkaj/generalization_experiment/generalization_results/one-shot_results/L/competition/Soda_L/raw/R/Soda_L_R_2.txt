First, we need to create the base of the letter R. The base consists of a row block "b31" and a column block "b13". We will drop the row block first and then the column block on top of it.

```python
# Drop the row block
ab_drop("b31", 8)

# Drop the column block on top of the row block
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

Next, we need to create the first vertical line of the letter R. This consists of two row blocks "b31" stacked on top of each other. We will drop these blocks one after the other.

```python
# Drop the top row block
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# Drop the bottom row block on top of the top row block
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Now, we move on to creating the angled part of the letter R. This consists of a column block "b13" and a row block "b31" attached to it. We will drop the column block first and then the row block on top of it.

```python
# Drop the column block
ab_drop("b13", 13)

# Drop the row block on top of the column block
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

Finally, we need to create the horizontal line of the letter R. This consists of a column block "b13" and a row block "b31" attached to it. We will drop the column block first and then the row block on top of it.

```python
# Drop the column block
ab_drop("b13", 16)

# Drop the row block on top of the column block
ab_drop("b31", 15)
```

The complete implementation to generate the letter R is:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 16)
ab_drop("b31", 15)
```
