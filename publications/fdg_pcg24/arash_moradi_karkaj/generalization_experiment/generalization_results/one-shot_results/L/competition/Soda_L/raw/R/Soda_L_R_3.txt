To create the letter "R" in a stable and similar way, we can use a combination of the "b31" and "b13" block types.

1. First, we will create the vertical left part of the letter "R" using the "b31" block type. We will place it at the leftmost column of the grid, centered vertically.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)  # Create the vertical left part of "R"
```

2. Next, we will create the bottom bar of the letter "R" using the "b13" block type. We will place it just above the vertical left part, centered horizontally.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Create the bottom bar of "R"
```

3. Finally, we will create the diagonal line of the letter "R" using the "b13" block type. We will place it diagonally from the top of the vertical left part to the bottom of the bottom bar.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Create the diagonal line of "R"
```

The complete implementation to create the letter "R" in a stable and similar way is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)  # Create the vertical left part of "R"
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Create the bottom bar of "R"
ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Create the diagonal line of "R"
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are stacked from bottom to top, resulting in a stable structure. It also creates a structure that resembles the letter "R" when viewed in the top-down orientation.
