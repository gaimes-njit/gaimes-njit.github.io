```python
# Step 1: Create the vertical left part of the letter R
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 3)

# Step 2: Create the top bar of the letter R
ab_drop("b13", 3)

# Step 3: Create the bottom bar of the letter R
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "R". Each block is dropped in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.
