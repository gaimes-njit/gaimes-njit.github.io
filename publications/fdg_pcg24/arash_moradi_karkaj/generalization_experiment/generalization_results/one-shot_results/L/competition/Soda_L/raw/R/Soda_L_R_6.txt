To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "R" (TARGET), we can break it down into multiple blocks and stack them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the base block of the letter "R"
ab_drop("b11", 18)

Step 2: Place the right vertical bar of the letter "R"
ab_drop("b13", 17)

Step 3: Place the horizontal top bar of the letter "R"
ab_drop("b31", 16)

Step 4: Place the diagonal bar of the letter "R"
ab_drop("b31", 17)

Step 5: Place the diagonal bar of the letter "R"
ab_drop("b31", 16)

By following these steps, we will have a structure that resembles the letter "R" in the game. Keep in mind that the stability of the structure is crucial, so make sure each block is well-supported and balanced.

Complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b11", 18)
ab_drop("b13", 17)
ab_drop("b31", 16)
ab_drop("b31", 17)
ab_drop("b31", 16)
```
