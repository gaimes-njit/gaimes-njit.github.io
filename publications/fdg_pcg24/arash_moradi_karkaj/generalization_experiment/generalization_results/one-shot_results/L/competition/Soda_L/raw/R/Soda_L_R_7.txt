To build the letter "R" using the bottom-to-top approach, we can break it down into smaller blocks and stack them in the desired order. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the base of the letter "R"

ab_drop("b13", 9)

Step 2: Place the vertical left part of the letter "R"

ab_drop("b31", 10)

Step 3: Place the top right part of the letter "R"

ab_drop("b13", 9)

Step 4: Place the middle horizontal part of the letter "R"

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Step 5: Place the bottom right part of the letter "R"

ab_drop("b13", 9)

By following these steps, we will be able to build a structure that looks like the letter "R". The blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability, and the order of placement also ensures the correct shape is achieved.
