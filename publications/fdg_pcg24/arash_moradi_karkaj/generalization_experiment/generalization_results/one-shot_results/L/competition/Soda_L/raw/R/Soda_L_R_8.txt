To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital character "R", we will need to drop blocks in a specific order and position. We will follow the given hints about the orientation and composition to build the letter "R" in the level. 

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the vertical pipe (top-left part):
```python
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

2. Drop the top bar (horizontal part):
```python
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

3. Drop the bottom tick (vertical pipe):
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

4. Drop the base (horizontal part):
```python
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will create the letter "R" in the level structure. The blocks are arranged in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. The letter "R" will be oriented in the natural top-down orientation.

Please note that the specific positions and sizes of the blocks may need adjustments depending on the exact grid layout and block sizes used in the Tetris game. The given positions and sizes are just for demonstration purposes and may need to be adapted to match the game's specific mechanics.
