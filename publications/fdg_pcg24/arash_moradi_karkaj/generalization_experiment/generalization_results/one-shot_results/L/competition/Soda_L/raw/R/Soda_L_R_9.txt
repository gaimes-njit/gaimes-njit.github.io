The first step is to create the base of the letter R. We can do this by dropping a row block at the bottom of the grid and centering it at a specific position. Let's drop a row block of size 3x1 centered at position 7:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

Next, we need to create the vertical line on the right side of the base. We can do this by dropping a column block of size 1x3 centered at position 15:

```
ab_drop("b13", 15)
```

Finally, we need to create the diagonal line on the left side of the base. We can do this by dropping a column block of size 1x3 centered at position 5 and then a row block of size 3x1 centered at position 4:

```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

This completes the construction of the letter R. You can run these ab_drop() calls in order to generate the desired structure.
