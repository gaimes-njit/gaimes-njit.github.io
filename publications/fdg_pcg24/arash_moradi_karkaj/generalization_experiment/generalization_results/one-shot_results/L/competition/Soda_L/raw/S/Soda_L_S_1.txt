To create the letter "S", we can break it down into multiple blocks and place them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the implementation:

```python
# Place the base of the "S"
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Bottom bar of "S"
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Middle bar of "S"
ab_drop("b13", 11)  # Top bar of "S"

# Place the upper part of the "S"
ab_drop("b31", 11)  # Right portion of "S"
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Middle portion of "S"
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Left portion of "S"
```

This implementation will create a structure that resembles the letter "S" and ensures stability by placing blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion.
