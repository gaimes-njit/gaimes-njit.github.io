To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital character "S", we can break it down into two blocks.

First, we need to place the bottom part of the letter "S". This can be achieved by using two column blocks ("b13") stacked vertically, with the leftmost column starting at x_position=8 and the rightmost column starting at x_position=9.

Second, we need to place the top part of the letter "S". We can use a row block ("b31") placed at x_position=7.

The complete implementation to generate the "S" structure can be done with the following code:

```
# Bottom part of the letter "S"
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Top part of the letter "S"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This implementation ensures stability by stacking blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, and achieves similarity by creating an "S" shape in the level.
