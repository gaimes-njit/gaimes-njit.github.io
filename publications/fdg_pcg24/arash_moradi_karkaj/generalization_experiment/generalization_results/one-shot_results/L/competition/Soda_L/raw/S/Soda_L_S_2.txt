To build the capital letter "S" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() calls:

```
# Bottom horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Middle horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Top horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Topmost vertical bar
ab_drop("b13", 4)

# Second vertical bar from the top
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

This sequence of calls will generate a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "S" when viewed from its natural orientation (top-down).
