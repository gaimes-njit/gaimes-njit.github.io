Here is the complete implementation to generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "S" (TARGET) using the ab_drop() function:

ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Place the base of the S
ab_drop("b13", 3)  # Place the middle part of the S
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Place the other part of the middle of the S
ab_drop("b11", 2)  # Place the top-left part of the S
ab_drop("b11", 4)  # Place the top-right part of the S

This implementation ensures stability by building the structure in a bottom-to-top fashion and placing the blocks in such a way that they support each other. It also generates a structure that looks like the letter "S" when evaluated in the top-down orientation.
