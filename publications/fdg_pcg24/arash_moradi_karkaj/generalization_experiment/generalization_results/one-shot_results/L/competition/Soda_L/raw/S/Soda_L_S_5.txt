To create the letter "S" in a stable and similar manner, we can break it down into several blocks and stack them in a bottom-to-top fashion. 

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Step 1: Place the base block
ab_drop("b13", 8) # Place a column block at x_position=8

# Step 2: Place the top right diagonal block
ab_drop("b11", 7) # Place a square block at x_position=7

# Step 3: Place the top left diagonal block
ab_drop("b11", 9) # Place a square block at x_position=9

# Step 4: Place the middle horizontal block
ab_drop("b31", 8) # Place a row block at x_position=8

# Step 5: Place the bottom right diagonal block
ab_drop("b11", 7) # Place a square block at x_position=7

# Step 6: Place the bottom left diagonal block
ab_drop("b11", 9) # Place a square block at x_position=9
```

These steps will create a stable structure in the shape of the letter "S". Note that the order and positioning of the blocks are crucial to ensure stability and similarity.
