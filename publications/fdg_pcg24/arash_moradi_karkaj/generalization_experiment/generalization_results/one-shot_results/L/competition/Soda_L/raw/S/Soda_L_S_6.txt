The first step is to build the base of the letter "S". We can achieve this by dropping a row block at the bottom-left corner of the grid and a column block on top of it. 

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

This will create the base of the letter "S". 

Next, we need to add the top-right part of the letter "S". We can achieve this by dropping a row block on top of the column block we just placed.

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

Finally, we need to complete the letter "S" by adding the bottom-left part. We can achieve this by dropping a column block on top of the row block at the bottom-left corner of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

The complete implementation, ensuring stability, and similarity to the letter "S" is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```
