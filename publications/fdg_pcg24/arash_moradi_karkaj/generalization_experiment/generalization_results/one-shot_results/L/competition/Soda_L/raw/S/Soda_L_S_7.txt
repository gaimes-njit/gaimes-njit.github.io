To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "S", we can break it down into several blocks and drop them in a specific order.

First, we need to create the base of the "S" which consists of two row blocks and one column block. We can drop them in the bottom left corner of the grid:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)   # bottom row block
ab_drop("b31", 2)   # middle row block
ab_drop("b13", 1)   # column block
```

Next, we need to create the top part of the "S" which consists of one row block and one column block. We can drop them above the base blocks:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)   # top row block
ab_drop("b13", 1)   # column block
```

Finally, we need to create the middle part of the "S" which consists of one row block and one column block. We can drop them above the top row block:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)   # middle row block
ab_drop("b13", 1)   # column block
```

The complete implementation to generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "S" is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)   # bottom row block
ab_drop("b31", 2)   # middle row block
ab_drop("b13", 1)   # column block
ab_drop("b31", 0)   # top row block
ab_drop("b13", 1)   # column block
ab_drop("b31", 0)   # middle row block
ab_drop("b13", 1)   # column block
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are stacked from bottom to top and creates a structure that resembles the capital letter "S".
