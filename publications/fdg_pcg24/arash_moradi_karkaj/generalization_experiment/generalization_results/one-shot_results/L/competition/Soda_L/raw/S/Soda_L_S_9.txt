To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital character "S" (TARGET), we can follow these steps:

1. Place the base of the "S" shape: 
   ab_drop("b31", 6)
   ab_drop("b13", 7)

2. Place the top-left part of the "S" shape:
   ab_drop("b13", 8)
   ab_drop("b11", 9)
   ab_drop("b13", 10)

3. Place the bottom-right part of the "S" shape:
   ab_drop("b11", 7)
   ab_drop("b13", 8)
   ab_drop("b13", 9)
   ab_drop("b31", 10)

4. Place the top-right part of the "S" shape:
   ab_drop("b13", 11)
   ab_drop("b11", 12)
   ab_drop("b13", 13)

5. Place the bottom-left part of the "S" shape:
   ab_drop("b13", 6)
   ab_drop("b31", 7)
   ab_drop("b13", 8)
   ab_drop("b11", 9)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
# Base of the "S" shape
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)

# Top-left part of the "S" shape
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# Bottom-right part of the "S" shape
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# Top-right part of the "S" shape
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 13)

# Bottom-left part of the "S" shape
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
