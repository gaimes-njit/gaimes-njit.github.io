To create the letter "T" in the level, we need to drop the blocks in a specific order and position to ensure stability and achieve the desired shape. 

Here's the step-by-step implementation to create the letter "T":

1. Drop the base block:
    ```
    ab_drop("b13", 9)
    ```

2. Drop the vertical bar:
    ```
    ab_drop("b31", 9)
    ```

3. Drop the horizontal bar:
    ```
    ab_drop("b13", 7)
    ```

The complete implementation to create the letter "T" is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```
