To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "T" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: the vertical pipe, the top bar, and the bottom bar. 

First, we will create the vertical pipe at the center of the level. 

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we will create the top bar above the vertical pipe.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Finally, we will create the bottom bar below the vertical pipe.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

The complete implementation to generate the "T" structure in the level:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```
