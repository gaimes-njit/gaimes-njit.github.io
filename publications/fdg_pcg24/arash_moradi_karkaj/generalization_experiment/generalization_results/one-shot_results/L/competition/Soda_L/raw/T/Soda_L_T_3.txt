To build the "T" character in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can use the following steps:

1. Place the base of the "T" using the 'b13' block type at the center of the grid.
2. Place the vertical part of the "T" using the 'b31' block type at the center of the grid.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
# Step 1: Place the base
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Step 2: Place the vertical part
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "T".
