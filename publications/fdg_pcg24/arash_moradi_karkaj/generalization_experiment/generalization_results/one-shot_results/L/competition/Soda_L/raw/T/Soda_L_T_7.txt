To create the capital letter "T", we need to first build a horizontal bar and then place a vertical bar on top of it. 
Here is the code to achieve that:

First, we build the horizontal bar:
```
# Place the base block
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

Next, we place the vertical bar on top of the horizontal bar to complete the "T" shape:
```
# Place the vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This code block will create a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "T".
