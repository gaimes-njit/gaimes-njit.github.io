To generate the letter "T" in a stable and similar structure, we can follow these steps:

1. Drop the base of the "T" using a "b13" block centered at position 9.
2. Drop the vertical part of the "T" using a "b31" block centered at position 9.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
