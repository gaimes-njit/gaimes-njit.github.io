In order to generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital "T", we can break it down into two blocks: a vertical column block and a horizontal row block. Then, we can stack them in the appropriate order and positions to form the desired shape. 

Here's the implementation to achieve this:

```
# Drop the vertical column block
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Drop the horizontal row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

By dropping the vertical column block first and then the horizontal row block centered at the same position, we create a structure that resembles the capital letter "T". This implementation ensures stability and similarity to the target shape.
