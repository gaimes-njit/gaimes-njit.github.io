In order to generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "U", we can follow the following steps:

1. Drop the base of the "U" shape using the row block "b31":
   ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Drop the left vertical part of the "U" shape using the column block "b13":
   ab_drop("b13", 8)

3. Drop the right vertical part of the "U" shape using the column block "b13":
   ab_drop("b13", 10)

Complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
