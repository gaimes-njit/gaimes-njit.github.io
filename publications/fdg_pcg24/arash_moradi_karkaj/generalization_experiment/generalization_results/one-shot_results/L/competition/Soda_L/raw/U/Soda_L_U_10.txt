To construct the letter "U" in the level, we need to use two row blocks ("b31") and one column block ("b13"). Here is the code to achieve this:

1. Place the first row block at x_position=3:
```
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

2. Place the second row block at x_position=9:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

3. Place the column block vertically at x_position=6 to form the center part of the "U":
```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation is:

```
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```
