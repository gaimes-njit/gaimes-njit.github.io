To create a structure that looks like the letter "U", we can break it down into three blocks - a top bar, a bottom bar, and a middle pipe. Here's how we can achieve this in the code:

1. Place the bottom bar:
ab_drop("b13", 6)

2. Place the top bar:
ab_drop("b13", 6)

3. Place the middle pipe:
ab_drop("b31", 7)

This arrangement will create a structure that resembles the letter "U" in the top-down orientation.

To ensure stability, we need to make sure that each block is balanced and well-supported. By placing the bottom bar first, followed by the top bar and middle pipe, we ensure that each block is stable and won't be pulled down by gravity.

Here's the complete implementation:

```
# Place the bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 6)

# Place the top bar
ab_drop("b13", 6)

# Place the middle pipe
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```
