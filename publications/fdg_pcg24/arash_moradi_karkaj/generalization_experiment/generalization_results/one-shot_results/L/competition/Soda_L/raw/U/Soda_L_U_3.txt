To generate a structure that looks like a capital "U" (TARGET), we can use the following steps:

Step 1: Place the left vertical bar of the "U" shape
```python
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

Step 2: Place the bottom horizontal bar of the "U" shape
```python
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

Step 3: Place the right vertical bar of the "U" shape
```python
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```

With these three steps, the completed code implementation to generate a structure that looks like a capital "U" (TARGET) would be:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 14)
```
