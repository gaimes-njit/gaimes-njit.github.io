To create a structure that looks like a capital "U" using the block-stacking technique in the Tetris game, we can follow these steps:

1. Drop the base of the "U" shape by placing a row block (b31) at the center bottom of the grid.
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Add the left vertical part of the "U" shape by placing a column block (b13) next to the base block.
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

3. Add the right vertical part of the "U" shape by placing another column block (b13) on the other side of the base block.
```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This series of ab_drop() calls will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "U" when viewed from the top-down orientation. The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```
