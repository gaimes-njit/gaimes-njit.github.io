The first step is to establish the base for the "U" shape. We can use the "b31" block to create the bottom horizontal line:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

Next, we need to place the vertical bars on either side of the bottom line. We can use the "b13" block for this:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

Finally, we can create the top horizontal line of the "U" shape using another "b31" block:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```
