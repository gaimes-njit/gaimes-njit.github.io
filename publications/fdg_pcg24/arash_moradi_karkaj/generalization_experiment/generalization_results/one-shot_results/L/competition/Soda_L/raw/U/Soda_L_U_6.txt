In order to generate the letter "U" in the level, we need to carefully drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Drop the base of the letter "U" using a row block (b31) at x_position=7:
```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

2. Add the left side of the letter "U" using a column block (b13) at x_position=6:
```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

3. Add the right side of the letter "U" using a column block (b13) at x_position=8:
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

4. To ensure stability, we need to add two additional support blocks. Place a row block (b31) at the bottom of the left side at x_position=5:
```
ab_drop("b31", 5)
```

5. Lastly, place a row block (b31) at the bottom of the right side at x_position=9:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The complete implementation to generate the letter "U" in the level would be as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
