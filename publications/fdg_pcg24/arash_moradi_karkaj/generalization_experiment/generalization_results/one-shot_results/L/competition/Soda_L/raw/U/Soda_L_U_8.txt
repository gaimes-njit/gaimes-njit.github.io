Here is the complete implementation to create the capital letter "U" using the ab_drop() function:

```
# Create the left vertical bar of the U
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# Create the base of the U
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
```

This implementation first creates the left vertical bar of the letter "U" by dropping five "b31" blocks centered at x-positions 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Then, it creates the base of the "U" by dropping ten "b13" blocks centered at x-positions 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

This implementation ensures stability by building the structure from the bottom to the top and creating a balanced formation. The resulting structure will resemble a capital letter "U".
