To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "U", we can follow these steps:

1. Create the base of the "U" shape by dropping a row block ("b31") at the center of the grid.
2. Place two square blocks ("b11") on either side of the base, just above it.
3. Drop two column blocks ("b13") on top of the square blocks, positioning them in a way that completes the vertical sides of the "U" shape.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Step 1: Create the base
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Step 2: Place the square blocks on top of the base
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 10)

# Step 3: Complete the vertical sides of the "U" shape
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

This implementation will create a stable structure in the shape of the capital letter "U".
