To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "V", we can break it down into two parts: the left slant and the right slant.

Here is the complete implementation to generate a stable and similar structure of the letter "V" in the bottom-to-top fashion:

```python
# Building the left slant of the "V"
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Vertical left part
ab_drop("b13", 3)  # Bottom bar

# Building the right slant of the "V"
ab_drop("b31", 14)  # Vertical right part
ab_drop("b13", 15)  # Bottom bar
```

In this implementation, we first build the left slant of the "V" by placing a vertical block (`b31`) at x_position=4 and a bottom bar (`b13`) at x_position=3. Then, we build the right slant of the "V" by placing a vertical block (`b31`) at x_position=14 and a bottom bar (`b13`) at x_position=15.

Since we are building the structure in a bottom-to-top fashion, the blocks will stack on top of each other, resulting in a stable structure. The final structure will resemble the capital letter "V".
