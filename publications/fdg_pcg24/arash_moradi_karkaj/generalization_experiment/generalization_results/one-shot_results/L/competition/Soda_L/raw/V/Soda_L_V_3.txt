To create a structure that looks like a capital "V" in the Tetris game, we can start by placing the two diagonal blocks first, followed by the horizontal block at the bottom. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Drop the diagonal blocks
```
ab_drop("b13", 6)  # Left diagonal block
ab_drop("b13", 14)  # Right diagonal block
```

Step 2: Drop the horizontal block
```
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Horizontal block
```

The final implementation will look like this:

```
ab_drop("b13", 6)  # Left diagonal block
ab_drop("b13", 14)  # Right diagonal block
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Horizontal block
```

This implementation ensures the best stability and similarity to the capital "V" character.
