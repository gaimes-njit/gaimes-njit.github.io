To create a structure that looks like a capital "V" (TARGET), we can break it down into three blocks: a center block and two diagonal blocks on either side. We will build the structure from the bottom to the top to ensure stability.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# First, we drop the center block (b11) at the center of the grid
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# Next, we drop the diagonal blocks (b13) on either side of the center block
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

This implementation first drops the center block (b11) at the center position (x_position=9), occupying cell (9, 0). Then, it drops the diagonal blocks (b13) on either side of the center block, occupying cells (7, 1), (9, 1), (11, 1), creating the desired "V" shape.

This implementation ensures stability as each block is well-supported and balanced, and it achieves the required similarity to the capital "V" shape.
