To create the letter V, we can break it down into three blocks: a top bar, a middle block, and a bottom bar. We will start by placing the bottom bar first, then the middle block, and finally the top bar.

```python
# Place the bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Place the middle block
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Place the top bar
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will generate a structure that resembles the letter V. To ensure stability, we place the blocks from bottom to top and ensure they are balanced.
