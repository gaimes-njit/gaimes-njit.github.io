To recreate the capital letter "V" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two diagonal bars and a base.

First, we need to place the diagonal bars of the "V". We can use the "b31" block type to create each diagonal bar. To achieve stability, we will drop each diagonal bar from the top and center it at the appropriate x_position.

Here is the code to place the first diagonal bar of the "V":

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

Next, we can place the second diagonal bar of the "V":

```
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

Finally, we need to add the base of the "V". We can use the "b13" block type to create the base. The x_position for the base should be such that it is centered between the two diagonal bars.

Here is the code to place the base of the "V":

```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to generate the "V" structure is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

This implementation ensures stability and creates a structure that resembles the capital letter "V".
