First, let's start by building the base of the "V" structure. We can achieve this by dropping a row block ("b31") at the center position of the grid.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we will add the two arms of the "V". We can do this by dropping two column blocks ("b13") at positions that align with the edges of the base block.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

Finally, we need to add a square block ("b11") at the center position of the top row to complete the "V" shape.

```python
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

The complete implementation, without error, is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
