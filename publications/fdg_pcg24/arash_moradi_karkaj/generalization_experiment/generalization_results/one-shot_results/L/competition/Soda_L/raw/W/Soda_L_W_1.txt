To generate the capital letter "W", we can break it down into three blocks and drop them in a specific order. Here is the complete implementation to achieve the best stability and similarity:

```
# The left bottom stroke of "W"
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 2)

# The right bottom stroke of "W"
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# The middle stroke of "W"
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
```

This implementation drops the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability. It also follows the specific order and positions needed to create the letter "W".
