Here is the implementation for generating the structure that looks like a capital "W":

```
# Place the bottom left part of the "W"
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)

# Place the bottom right part of the "W"
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

# Place the top part of the "W"
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

This implementation follows the technique mentioned in the hints section. We first place the bottom left part of the "W" using two blocks, then the bottom right part with two blocks, and finally the top part with two blocks. This ensures that the structure is stable and resembles the capital "W" in shape.
