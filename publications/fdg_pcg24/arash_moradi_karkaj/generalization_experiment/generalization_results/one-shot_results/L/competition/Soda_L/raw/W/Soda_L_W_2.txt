We need to build a structure in the shape of the letter "W". First, let's start by creating the base of the "W" using a row block (b31).

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the two diagonal arms of the "W" using column blocks (b13). We can place these arms right next to the base blocks.

```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Finally, we need to create the top of the "W" using a row block (b31). We can place it above the middle column of the arms.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This completes the structure. The complete implementation without any errors is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
