First, let's build the base of the "W" structure. We can use the "b31" block type with the center pivot point at x_position=7. This will occupy cells (6, 0), (7, 0), and (8, 0).

```python
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

Now, let's add the top left diagonal part of the "W" structure. We can use the "b13" block type with the center pivot point at x_position=6. This will occupy cells (5, 1), (6, 1), and (7, 1).

```python
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

Next, let's add the top right diagonal part of the "W" structure. We can use the "b13" block type with the center pivot point at x_position=9. This will occupy cells (8, 1), (9, 1), and (10, 1).

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, let's add the middle part of the "W" structure. We can use the "b13" block type with the center pivot point at x_position=8. This will occupy cells (7, 2), (8, 2), and (9, 2).

```python
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```
