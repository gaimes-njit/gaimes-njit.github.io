To create the letter "W" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two outer diagonal blocks and one center block.

To begin, we need to create the outer diagonal blocks. We can achieve this by dropping two "b13" blocks diagonally from the top and centered at specific slots. 

```python
# Drop the first diagonal block
ab_drop("b13", 5)

# Drop the second diagonal block
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```

Now, we need to create the center block. We can achieve this by dropping a "b31" block vertically from the top and center it at a specific slot.

```python
# Drop the center block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

By following these steps, we will have successfully created the letter "W" in the level.
