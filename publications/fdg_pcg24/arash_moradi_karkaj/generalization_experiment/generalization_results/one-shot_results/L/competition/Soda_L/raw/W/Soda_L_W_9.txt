To create the capital letter "W" in the game, we can break it down into multiple blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Drop the base of the "W":
```
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```
This will create the bottom part of the "W" structure.

2. Drop the left diagonal part of the "W":
```
ab_drop("b11", 8)
```
This will create the left diagonal line of the "W" structure.

3. Drop the right diagonal part of the "W":
```
ab_drop("b11", 13)
```
This will create the right diagonal line of the "W" structure.

4. Drop the top part of the "W":
```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```
This will create the top part of the "W" structure.

The complete implementation to create the capital letter "W" in the game, ensuring stability and similarity, is as follows:
```
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```
