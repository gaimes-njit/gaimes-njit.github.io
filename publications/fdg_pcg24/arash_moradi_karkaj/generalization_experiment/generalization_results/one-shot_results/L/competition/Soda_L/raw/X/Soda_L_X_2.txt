Here is an implementation of the steps needed to create a structure that looks like a capital "X":

Step 1: Place the base
ab_drop("b13", 9)

Step 2: Place the upper diagonal
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 11)

Step 3: Place the lower diagonal
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 13)

This implementation ensures that the structure is stable and resembles the capital letter "X".
