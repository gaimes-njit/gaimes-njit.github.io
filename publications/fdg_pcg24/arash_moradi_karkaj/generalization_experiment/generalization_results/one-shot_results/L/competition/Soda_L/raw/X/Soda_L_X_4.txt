To create the structure of the letter "X" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can divide it into three parts: the two diagonal lines and the center block. Here's the code to create the letter "X":

```python
# Diagonal line 1
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 13)

# Diagonal line 2
ab_drop("b11", 14)
ab_drop("b11", 15)
ab_drop("b11", 16)
ab_drop("b11", 17)

# Center block
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by creating the first diagonal line from the bottom left corner to the top right corner. We place four small square blocks ("b11") at x positions 10, 11, 12, and 13.
2. Next, we create the second diagonal line from the bottom right corner to the top left corner. We place four small square blocks ("b11") at x positions 14, 15, 16, and 17.
3. Finally, we create the center block by placing a row block ("b31") with its center at x position 13.

This code will generate a structure that resembles the letter "X" in a bottom-to-top fashion, fulfilling the stability and similarity criteria.
