To create a stable and similar structure of the letter X, we need to plan the placement of blocks carefully. One possible approach is to start from the bottom and build the structure layer by layer.

First, we can create the two diagonal lines of the letter X using two row blocks (b31). We will place them at the bottom with a gap in the middle.

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 15)
```

Next, we can add the two horizontal lines of the letter X using two column blocks (b13).

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Finally, we can fill the gap in the middle of the letter X using a square block (b11).

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

The complete implementation to create a stable and similar structure of the letter X is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 15)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
