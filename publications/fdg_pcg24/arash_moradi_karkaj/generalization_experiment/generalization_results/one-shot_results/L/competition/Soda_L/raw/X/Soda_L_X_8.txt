To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "X", we can break it down into two block placements: one for the diagonal arms of the "X" and one for the center vertical line.

Here is the step-by-step code to generate the "X" structure while ensuring stability:

```
# Drop the first diagonal arm of the "X" (top left to bottom right)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 13)
ab_drop("b11", 16)
ab_drop("b11", 19)

# Drop the second diagonal arm of the "X" (top right to bottom left)
ab_drop("b11", 19)
ab_drop("b11", 16)
ab_drop("b11", 13)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 1)

# Drop the center vertical line of the "X"
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)

# End of code
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "X" when viewed from the top. The diagonal arms are created by placing individual 1x1 blocks, while the center vertical line is created by placing three 1x1 blocks.
