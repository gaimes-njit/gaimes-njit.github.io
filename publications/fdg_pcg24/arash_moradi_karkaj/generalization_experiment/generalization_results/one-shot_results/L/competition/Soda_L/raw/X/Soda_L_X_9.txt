The first step is to create the vertical bar for the letter "L" by dropping a block of type "b31" centered at x_position 10:

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

The second step is to create the bottom bar for the letter "L" by dropping a block of type "b13" centered at x_position 9:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

The complete implementation for creating the letter "L" in the natural orientation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
