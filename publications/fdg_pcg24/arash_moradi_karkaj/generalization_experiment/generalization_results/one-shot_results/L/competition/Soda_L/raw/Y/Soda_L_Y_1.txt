To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "Y" in the Tetris game, we can start by creating the base of the letter and then adding the two arms.

1. Building the base of the "Y":
   - Drop a column block ("b13") centered at x_position = 9.
   - Drop a square block ("b11") centered at x_position = 10.
   - Drop a column block ("b13") centered at x_position = 11.

2. Adding the left arm of the "Y":
   - Drop a row block ("b31") centered at x_position = 9.

3. Adding the right arm of the "Y":
   - Drop a row block ("b31") centered at x_position = 11.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

This implementation creates a structure that resembles the capital letter "Y" and ensures stability by following the bottom-to-top approach for block stacking.
