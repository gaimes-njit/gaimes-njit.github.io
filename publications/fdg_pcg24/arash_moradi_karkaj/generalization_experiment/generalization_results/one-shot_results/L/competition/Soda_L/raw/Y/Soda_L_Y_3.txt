To create the letter Y, we can break it down into three blocks: an upper bar, a middle bar, and a lower bar. Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the upper bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Place the middle bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# Place the lower bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation follows the bottom-to-top approach, ensuring stability of each block. The blocks are centered at x_position 9 to create the Y shape.
