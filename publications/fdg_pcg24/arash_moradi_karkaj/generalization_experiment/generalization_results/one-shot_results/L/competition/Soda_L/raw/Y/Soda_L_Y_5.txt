To create the letter Y with stable blocks, we can break it down into three blocks: two diagonal bars and a horizontal bar connecting them. We can drop each block in a specific order to ensure stability.

Here is the implementation to create the letter Y:

```python
# Drop the blocks to create the diagonal bar on the left
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# Drop the block to create the horizontal bar connecting the diagonal bars
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Drop the blocks to create the diagonal bar on the right
ab_drop("b13", 14)
ab_drop("b13", 16)
```

This implementation creates a stable structure that resembles the letter Y.
