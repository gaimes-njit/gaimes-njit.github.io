To build the letter Y, we will break it down into three blocks: the top bar, the vertical pipe, and the bottom bar. We will stack them in the bottom-to-top order.

1. For the bottom bar:
We will use the column block "b13" and place it at x_position=9.
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

2. For the vertical pipe:
We will use the row block "b31" and place it at x_position=9.
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

3. For the top bar:
We will use the column block "b13" and place it at x_position=9.
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Here is the complete implementation (contains no indentation and only ab_drop() calls):

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
