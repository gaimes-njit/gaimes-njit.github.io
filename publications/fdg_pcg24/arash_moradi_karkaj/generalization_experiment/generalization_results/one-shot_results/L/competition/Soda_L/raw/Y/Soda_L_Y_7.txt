To create a structure that looks like the letter "Y", we can break it down into three components: the vertical stem, the top arm, and the bottom arm. Here's how we can create each component:

1. Vertical stem:
ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Top arm:
ab_drop("b13", 8)

3. Bottom arm:
ab_drop("b13", 10)

Putting it all together, here's the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
