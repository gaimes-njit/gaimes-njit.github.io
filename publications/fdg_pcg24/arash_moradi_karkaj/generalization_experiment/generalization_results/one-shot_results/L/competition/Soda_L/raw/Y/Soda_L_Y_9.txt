To generate the "Y" character in a bottom-to-top fashion and ensure stability, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the base of the "Y"
We can start by placing a row block ("b31") at the bottom of the grid.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 2: Place the vertical bar of the "Y"
Next, we can place a column block ("b13") on top of the base, centered horizontally.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Step 3: Place the upper-right arm of the "Y"
To create the upper-right arm of the "Y", we need to place a row block above the vertical bar, shifted to the right.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Step 4: Place the upper-left arm of the "Y"
Finally, we can complete the "Y" by placing another row block above the vertical bar, but this time shifted to the left.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

By following these steps and placing the blocks in the specified order, we can generate a "Y" structure that is stable and resembles the target character.

Complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

This implementation will result in a stable "Y" structure that looks similar to the target character.
