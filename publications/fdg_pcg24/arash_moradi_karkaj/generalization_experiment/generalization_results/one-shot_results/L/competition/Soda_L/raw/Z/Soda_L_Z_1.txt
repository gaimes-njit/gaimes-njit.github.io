To create a structure in the shape of the capital letter "Z", we will need to stack blocks in a specific order and position. Here is the step-by-step implementation to achieve this:

1. Drop the base block (row block) at the bottom-left corner of the grid:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

2. Drop the diagonal block (column block) one cell to the right of the base block:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

3. Drop the top block (row block) two cells to the right of the diagonal block:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

Together, these three steps will create a structure that resembles the letter "Z" when viewed from the top. The blocks are stacked in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability, and the positioning is arranged to match the desired shape.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```
