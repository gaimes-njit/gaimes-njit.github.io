To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "Z", we can break it down into three blocks: a row block (b31) for the top part, a square block (b11) for the middle part, and another row block (b31) for the bottom part.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
# Place the top row block (b31) centered at x_position = 9
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Place the square block (b11) centered at x_position = 8
ab_drop("b11", 8)

# Place the bottom row block (b31) centered at x_position = 7
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This implementation will create a structure that resembles the capital letter "Z" when viewed top-down.
