First, let's start by creating the base of the letter Z. We can use a column block "b13" centered at position 9.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, we'll create the diagonal top part of the letter Z. We can use a row block "b31" centered at position 6. Additionally, we'll add a square block "b11" on top of it to complete the diagonal shape.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

Finally, we'll create the horizontal bottom part of the letter Z. We can use a row block "b31" centered at position 3. Additionally, we'll add a square block "b11" on top of it to complete the horizontal shape.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

The complete implementation would look like this:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```
