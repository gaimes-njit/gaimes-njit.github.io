To create the letter Z, we can break it down into two blocks: a row block and a column block. The row block will form the top bar of the Z, and the column block will form the bottom part of the Z.

Here is the code to create the letter Z:

```
# Drop the row block at the top
ab_drop("b31", 1)
# Drop the column block at the bottom
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This code will drop the blocks in the correct order and positions to form a stable and similar structure to the letter Z.
