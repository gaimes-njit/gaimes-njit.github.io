To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "Z", we can use the following steps:

1. Place the base of the "Z" structure, which is a row block (b31), at x_position=0:
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

2. Place the vertical part of the "Z" structure, which is a column block (b13), at x_position=1:
```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

3. Place the top part of the "Z" structure, which is a row block (b31), at x_position=2:
```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

By following these steps, we can build a structure in the level that resembles the capital letter "Z". The blocks will be placed in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```
