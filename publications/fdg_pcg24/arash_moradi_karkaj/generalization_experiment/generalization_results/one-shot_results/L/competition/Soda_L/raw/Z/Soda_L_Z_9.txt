To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "Z" in the Tetris game, we can break it down into three blocks: a row block at the bottom, a column block in the middle, and another row block at the top. We can use the ab_drop() function to drop each block in the appropriate position.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
# Drop the bottom row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Drop the middle column block
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# Drop the top row block
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This code will drop the three blocks in the order mentioned above, creating a structure that looks like the letter "Z". The blocks are centered at positions 9, 8, and 7 respectively, ensuring that the structure is balanced and stable.

Note: The positioning of the blocks may vary slightly depending on the specific implementation of the ab_drop() function and the Tetris game mechanics. Adjust the positions if needed to achieve the desired shape.
