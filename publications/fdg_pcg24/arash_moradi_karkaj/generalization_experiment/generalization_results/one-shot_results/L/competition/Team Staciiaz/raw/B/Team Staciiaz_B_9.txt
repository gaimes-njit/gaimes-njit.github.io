To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "B" and meets all the given constraints, we can follow the following approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions W x H.
2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a specific order and position to form the "B" shape. 

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Start by dropping the b13 block at slot 1 using `ab_drop('b13', 1)`. This block represents the top-left vertical part of the "B".
2. Next, drop the b31 block at slot 1 using `ab_drop('b31', 1)`. This block represents the top horizontal part of the "B".
3. Drop the b13 block at slot 4 using `ab_drop('b13', 4)`. This block represents the top-right vertical part of the "B".
4. Drop the b31 block at slot 1 using `ab_drop('b31', 1)`. This block represents the bottom horizontal part of the "B".
5. Finally, drop the b13 block at slot 1 using `ab_drop('b13', 1)`. This block represents the bottom-left vertical part of the "B".

After following these steps, the structure will resemble the character "B" and meet all the given constraints.
