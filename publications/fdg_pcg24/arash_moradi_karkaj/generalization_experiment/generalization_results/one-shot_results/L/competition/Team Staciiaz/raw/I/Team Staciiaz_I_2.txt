To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "I," we can use the `ab_drop()` function and apply the constraints mentioned. Here is a step-by-step guide to achieving the goal while satisfying the constraints:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH using the provided code snippet:
   ```
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Determine the dropping position and order for each block type ('b11', 'b31', 'b13') using techniques in the block-stacking problem. Since we want to create the character "I," the dropping positions and order will be as follows:

   2.1. Drop 'b31' vertically at slot 9, layer 0:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

   2.2. Drop 'b13' vertically at slot 9, layer 3:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

   2.3. Drop 'b13' vertically at slot 9, layer 6:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

   2.4. Drop 'b31' vertically at slot 9, layer 9:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

   2.5. Drop 'b31' vertically at slot 9, layer 12:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

3. After following these steps, the structure will resemble the character "I" and meet the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints. You can visualize the final structure by printing the `structure` variable.

Note: The exact dropping positions and order mentioned above are one possible solution to meet the constraints. There may be other valid solutions as well.
