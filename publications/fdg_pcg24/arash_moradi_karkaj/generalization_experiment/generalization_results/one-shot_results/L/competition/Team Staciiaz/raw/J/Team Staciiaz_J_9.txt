To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "J" and meets all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define the block types and their shapes:
```
block_shapes = {
    'b11': [(0, 0)],
    'b31': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)],
    'b13': [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (-2, 0)]
}
```

3. Start by dropping the 'b31' block at slot 0:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

4. Drop the 'b11' block at slot 2:
```
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

5. Drop the 'b11' block at slot 3:
```
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

6. Drop the 'b11' block at slot 4:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

7. Drop the 'b13' block at slot 4:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

8. Drop the 'b13' block at slot 4:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

9. Drop the 'b13' block at slot 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

10. Drop the 'b13' block at slot 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

11. Drop the 'b13' block at slot 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
