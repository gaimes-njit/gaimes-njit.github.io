To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "M" and meets all the constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Define the initial structure as an empty grid:

```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define the block types and their shapes:

```python
block_shapes = {
    'b11': [(0, 0)],
    'b31': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)],
    'b13': [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (-2, 0)]
}
```

3. Define the drop position selection algorithm:

```python
def select_drop_position():
    # Implement your algorithm here
```

4. Create a function to drop a block at a selected position:

```python
def drop_block(block_type, x_position):
    highest_empty_height = get_highest_empty_y_position(x_position)

    if x_position < 0 or x_position >= W:
        print("Invalid x_position")
        return

    if block_type not in block_shapes:
        print("Invalid block type")
        return

    for dx, dy in block_shapes[block_type]:
        y = highest_empty_height + dy
        if y < 0 or y >= H:
            print(f"Invalid x_position for block type '{block_type}'")
            return
        structure[y][x_position + dx] = 'x'
```

5. Define the stability check function:

```python
def check_stability():
    # Implement your stability check algorithm here
```

6. Implement the `ab_drop()` function using the above components:

```python
def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    drop_block(block_type, x_position)
    if not check_stability():
        print("The dropped block caused instability. Retry with a different position.")
        return
    print("Block dropped successfully.")
```

7. Use the `ab_drop()` function to generate the desired structure:

```python
ab_drop('b11', select_drop_position())  # Drop the first block
ab_drop('b31', select_drop_position())  # Drop the second block
ab_drop('b13', select_drop_position())  # Drop the third block
ab_drop('b31', select_drop_position())  # Drop the fourth block
ab_drop('b11', select_drop_position())  # Drop the fifth block
```

By repeating step 7, adjusting block types and positions, and using the stability check function, you can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "M" and meets all the constraints.
