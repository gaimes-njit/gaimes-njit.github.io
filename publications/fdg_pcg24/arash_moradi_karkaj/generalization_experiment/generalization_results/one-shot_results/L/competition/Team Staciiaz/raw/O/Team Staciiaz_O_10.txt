To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "O" and meets all the constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code snippet.
2. Start by dropping a vertical block (b13) in the center of the bottom layer, at slot 9. Use the `ab_drop('b13', 9)` function to drop the block.
3. Next, drop two horizontal blocks (b31) above the vertical block at slots 8 and 10. Use the `ab_drop('b31', 8)` and `ab_drop('b31', 10)` functions to drop the blocks.
4. Repeat step 3, but this time on the layers above, dropping the horizontal blocks at slots 7 and 11.
5. Continue this pattern, alternating between vertical and horizontal blocks, until the structure reaches the desired height.
6. Finally, drop a vertical block on top of the structure at slot 9 to complete the "O" shape.

The code below demonstrates the step-by-step process:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Drop the initial vertical block at the bottom layer, slot 9
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Step 3: Drop the first pair of horizontal blocks above the vertical block
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Step 4: Repeat step 3 on the layers above
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 11)

# Step 5: Continue alternating between vertical and horizontal blocks
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 15)

# Step 6: Complete the "O" shape by dropping a vertical block on top
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "O" and meets all the given constraints.
