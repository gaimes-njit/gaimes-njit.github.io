To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Q" and meets all the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop each block in a strategic order. Here's an outline of the steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given code snippet:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block, a square block (b11), at slot 10 to create the shape of the character "Q". This block will be dropped from the top layer (H-1) using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

3. Drop the next block, a horizontal block (b31), at slot 7. This block will be dropped from a height that aligns with the top of the square block (y-position of the square block - 2) to maintain stability:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

4. Drop the next block, a vertical block (b13), at slot 13. This block will be dropped from a height that aligns with the bottom of the square block (y-position of the square block + 1) to maintain stability:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 13)
```

5. Drop the final block, a horizontal block (b31), at slot 16. This block will be dropped from the same height as the previous horizontal block to maintain stability:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 16)
```

After executing these steps, the `structure` grid will represent a stable structure that looks like the character "Q" and meets all the given constraints.

Please note that the specific slot positions and block types used in this outline may need adjustment based on the specific weight distribution and shape of the character "Q" desired.
