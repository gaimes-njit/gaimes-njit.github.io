To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "S" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Check for stability: 
   - Based on the given block types 'b11', 'b31', and 'b13', determine how many slots each block type occupies horizontally.
   - Determine the maximum height required by each block type to check for stability.
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum slot positions where each block type can be dropped to maintain stability, considering the block's width and the slots occupied by previously dropped blocks.

2. Drop the blocks:
   - Start with the bottom layer (layer 0) and iterate through each slot from left (slot 0) to right (slot 19).
   - If the slot position is within the minimum and maximum slot positions for a specific block type, drop the block using the `ab_drop()` function at the current slot position.
   - Use the drop position and order information to ensure that blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure are dropped earlier.

3. Repeat step 2 for all layers:
   - Proceed to the next layer (from bottom to top), and repeat step 2 to drop blocks that maintain stability and meet the constraints.

By following these steps, the `ab_drop()` function can be used effectively to generate a stable "S" structure that meets all the constraints.
