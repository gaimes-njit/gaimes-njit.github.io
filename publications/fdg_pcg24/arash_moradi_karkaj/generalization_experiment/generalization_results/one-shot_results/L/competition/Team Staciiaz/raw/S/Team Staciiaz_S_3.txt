In order to generate a stable structure that looks like the character "S" and meets all the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in a strategic way.

First, we need to determine the proper sequence of dropping the blocks. We can start by dropping the bottom part of the "S", which is a vertical block (`b13`). This will form the base of the structure. We can drop it at the center slot (slot 10) to ensure stability.

Next, we can drop the middle part of the "S" using a horizontal block (`b31`). We can drop it at slot 6 to give it proper weight distribution. This will form the middle layer of the structure.

Finally, we can drop the top part of the "S" using a vertical block (`b13`). We can drop it at slot 14 to complete the structure.

Here's the code for generating the stable structure that looks like the character "S" and meets all the given constraints:

``` python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    ...
    # Rest of the code for the ab_drop() function (as given)

# Drop the bottom part of the "S"
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Drop the middle part of the "S"
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Drop the top part of the "S"
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```

This sequence of block dropping ensures stability, as each block is dropped at a proper slot to distribute the weight evenly. Additionally, the structure does not intrude on the boundary of the map, meeting the constraint of no boundary intrusion.
