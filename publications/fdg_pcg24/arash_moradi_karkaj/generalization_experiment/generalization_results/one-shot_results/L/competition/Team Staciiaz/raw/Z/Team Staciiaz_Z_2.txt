To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Z", we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a strategic manner. Here is a step-by-step guide to achieve this goal while satisfying the given constraints:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```py
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block ('b31') at the center of slot 0:
```py
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```
This will create the bottom horizontal line of the character "Z".

3. Drop the second block ('b13') at the center of slot 1:
```py
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
This will create the vertical line of the character "Z".

4. Drop the third block ('b31') at the center of slot 2:
```py
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
This will create the top horizontal line of the character "Z".

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Z" while satisfying the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints.
