Solution:
To generate a stable structure that looks like the letter "B", follow these steps:

1. Drop a b13 block at layer 15, slot 8. This will be the vertical line of the letter "B".
2. Drop a b31 block at layer 14, slot 9. This will be the top horizontal line of the "B".
3. Drop a b31 block at layer 13, slot 7. This will be the bottom horizontal line of the "B".
4. Drop a b11 block at layer 12, slot 7. This will be the curved part of the letter "B".
5. Drop a b11 block at layer 11, slot 6. This will complete the curved part of the letter "B".

By following these steps and dropping the blocks in the specified positions and order, you will create a stable structure that looks like the letter "B" using the 'ab drop()' function.
