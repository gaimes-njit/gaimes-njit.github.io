4. Procedure
To create the "J" structure using the ab drop() function, follow these steps:

Step 1: Start by dropping a b13 block at layer 15 with its center at slot 9. This block represents the vertical stroke of the "J".

Step 2: Next, drop a b31 block at layer 14 with its center at slot 9. This block forms the top arm of the "J".

Step 3: Finally, drop a b11 block at layer 15 with its center at slot 6. This block completes the bottom arm of the "J".

By following these steps and carefully selecting the dropping positions and order, you can generate a stable structure that resembles the letter "J" using the ab drop() function.
