To generate a stable structure that looks like the letter "T", we can follow these steps using the 'ab drop()' function:

1. Start by dropping a b31 block centered at slot 9 from layer 15. This will form the vertical part of the "T".

2. Next, drop a b11 block centered at slot 9 from layer 12. This will act as the horizontal part of the "T".

3. Finally, drop another b11 block centered at slot 8 from layer 12. This will complete the horizontal part of the "T".

By following these steps and carefully choosing the dropping positions and order, you should be able to generate a stable structure that resembles the letter "T".
