The objective is to create a stable structure representing the capital letter "A" using the `ab_drop()` function while adhering to the constraint of stability and minimizing boundary intrusion. Here is one possible solution:

```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

This solution creates a stable structure resembling the letter "A" by vertically dropping the blocks in the appropriate positions. The `ab_drop()` function is used to drop blocks of type `b13` and `b31` at specific `x_position` values.
