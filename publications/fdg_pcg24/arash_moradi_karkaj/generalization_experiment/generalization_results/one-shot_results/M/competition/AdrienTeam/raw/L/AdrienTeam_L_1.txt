Here is the code to generate the structure resembling "L" while satisfying the given constraints:

```python
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the first block to form the base
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the second block to form the vertical part of the "L"
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the third block to complete the horizontal part of the "L"
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8)

# Drop the fourth block to form the bottom part of the "L"
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the fifth block to form the top part of the "L"
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the sixth block to complete the vertical part of the "L"
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the seventh block to complete the bottom part of the "L"
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the eighth block to complete the top part of the "L"
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

This code follows the given constraints and generates the structure resembling "L".
