Here is the solution to generate the structure resembling "S" while meeting all the given constraints:

```python
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the first block to start building "S"
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop a vertical block at slot 9

# Drop the second block to continue building "S"
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Drop a horizontal block at slot 7

# Drop the third block to complete building "S"
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Drop a vertical block at slot 1
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will generate a stable structure resembling the letter "S" while satisfying all the given constraints.
