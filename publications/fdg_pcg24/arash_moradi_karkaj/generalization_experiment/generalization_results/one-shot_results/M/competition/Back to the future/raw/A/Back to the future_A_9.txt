To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A", we can follow the following steps:

1. First, initialize the structure as an empty grid:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Next, we can start building the structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15).

3. To ensure stability, we need to check for each drop if the structure will remain stable.

4. We will start by dropping two vertical blocks (b13) at the sides, making sure to place them at slots 2 and 17 to leave enough space for the middle part of the "A".

5. Next, we will drop a horizontal block (b31) at the center, aligning its center at slot 9.

6. To add stability to the structure, we will drop vertical blocks (b13) at slots 8 and 10, vertically aligned with the horizontal block in layer 2.

7. Finally, we will drop a square block (b11) at the center of the top layer (layer 15) to complete the shape of the uppercase "A".

The code for generating the structure can be written as follows:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Build the structure
def build_structure():
    # Step 3: Drop two vertical blocks at the sides
    ab_drop('b13', 2)  # left side
    ab_drop('b13', 17)  # right side

    # Step 4: Drop a horizontal block at the center
    ab_drop('b31', 9)

    # Step 5: Add stability to the structure
    ab_drop('b13', 8)  # left support
    ab_drop('b13', 10)  # right support

    # Step 6: Complete the shape with a square block
    ab_drop('b11', 9)  # top center

# Step 7: Drop function
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Check stability before each drop
    if check_stability(x, y):
        # Drop the block
        drop_pos = (H-1, y)
        while drop_pos[0] > 0:
            drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
            if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
                break
        structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Stability check function
def check_stability(x, y):
    # Check stability based on block type and position
    # Implement stability check logic here
    return True  # Return True if stable, False otherwise

# Step 8: Call the build_structure function to generate the structure
build_structure()
```

Note: The stability check function (check_stability) should be implemented to ensure that the structure remains stable after each drop. The logic for stability check will depend on the specific rules and constraints of the block-stacking problem in the Tetris game.
