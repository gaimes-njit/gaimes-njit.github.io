To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "E" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the upper horizontal part of the "E" (b31), which consists of three b11 blocks. Drop the blocks one by one using the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

3. Next, drop the vertical part of the "E" (b13) from layer 13, aligned with slot 7:
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

4. Finally, drop the lower horizontal part of the "E" (b31), which consists of three b11 blocks. Drop the blocks one by one using the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

After following these steps, the structure should resemble the uppercase character "E" and meet all the hard constraints. Note that the specific coordinates for each `ab_drop()` call may vary depending on the stability of the structure and the desired placement of the blocks.
