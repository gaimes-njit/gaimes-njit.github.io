To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "F", we can use the `ab_drop()` function to sequentially drop the blocks in a strategic manner. Here is an example solution:

1. Start by dropping the b31 block at slot 4:
   - Call `ab_drop('b31', 4)`
   - The block will be dropped at position (H-1, 4) and end up at (H-3, 4)
   - Fill the coordinates in the structure as `structure[H-1][4] = 'b31'` and `structure[H-3][4] = 'b31'`

2. Drop the b11 block to support the central part of the b31 block:
   - Call `ab_drop('b11', 4)`
   - The block will be dropped at position (H-1, 4) and end up at (H-2, 4)
   - Fill the coordinate in the structure as `structure[H-2][4] = 'b11'`

3. Drop another b11 block to support the central part of the b31 block:
   - Call `ab_drop('b11', 4)`
   - The block will be dropped at position (H-1, 4) and end up at (H-1, 4)
   - Fill the coordinate in the structure as `structure[H-1][4] = 'b11'`

4. Drop the b13 block on the left side of the b31 block:
   - Call `ab_drop('b13', 3)`
   - The block will be dropped at position (H-1, 3) and end up at (H-1, 3), as there is no support required for this block
   - Fill the coordinate in the structure as `structure[H-1][3] = 'b13'`

5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to add support for the b13 block:
   - Call `ab_drop('b11', 3)`
   - The block will be dropped at position (H-1, 3) and end up at (H-2, 3)
   - Fill the coordinate in the structure as `structure[H-2][3] = 'b11'`
   - Call `ab_drop('b11', 3)`
   - The block will be dropped at position (H-1, 3) and end up at (H-3, 3)
   - Fill the coordinate in the structure as `structure[H-3][3] = 'b11'`

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to create the right part of the "F" structure:
   - Call `ab_drop('b13', 5)`
   - The block will be dropped at position (H-1, 5) and end up at (H-1, 5), as there is no support required for this block
   - Fill the coordinate in the structure as `structure[H-1][5] = 'b13'`
   - Call `ab_drop('b11', 5)`
   - The block will be dropped at position (H-1, 5) and end up at (H-2, 5)
   - Fill the coordinate in the structure as `structure[H-2][5] = 'b11'`
   - Call `ab_drop('b11', 5)`
   - The block will be dropped at position (H-1, 5) and end up at (H-3, 5)
   - Fill the coordinate in the structure as `structure[H-3][5] = 'b11'`

After following these steps, the structure should resemble the uppercase character "F" and meet all the hard constraints.
