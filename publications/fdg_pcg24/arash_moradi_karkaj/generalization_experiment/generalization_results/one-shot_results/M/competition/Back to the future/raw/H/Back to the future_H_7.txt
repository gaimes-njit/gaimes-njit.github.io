To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase letter "H" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Place the base of the "H" structure by dropping a b31 block at the center slot:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', W//2)
   ```

3. Create the vertical part of the "H" structure by dropping two b13 blocks on top of the base, each at the adjacent slots:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', W//2 - 1)
   ab_drop('b13', W//2 + 1)
   ```

4. Create the horizontal part of the "H" structure by dropping a b31 block on top of the vertical part, aligning its center with the base:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', W//2)
   ```

5. Check the stability of the structure after each drop using a stability check function:
   ```
   def stability_check():
     for i in range(H-1):
       for j in range(W):
         if structure[i][j] != ' ' and structure[i+1][j] == ' ':
           return False
     return True
   ```

6. Continue dropping blocks and checking stability to complete the "H" structure:
   - Drop a b31 block on top of the horizontal part, aligned with the base:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', W//2)
     ```

   - Drop two b11 blocks on top of the horizontal part, centered with the base and each slot adjacent to it:
     ```
     ab_drop('b11', W//2 - 1)
     ab_drop('b11', W//2 + 1)
     ```

   - Drop a b31 block on top of the previous b11 blocks, aligned with the center slot:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', W//2)
     ```

   - Drop two b11 blocks on top of the previous b31 block, each at the adjacent slots:
     ```
     ab_drop('b11', W//2 - 1)
     ab_drop('b11', W//2 + 1)
     ```

   - Drop a b31 block on top of the previous b11 blocks, aligned with the center slot:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', W//2)
     ```

   - Drop a b31 block on top of the previous b31 block, aligned with the center slot:
     ```
     ab_drop('b31', W//2)
     ```

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the entire "H" structure is complete.

8. Finally, check the overall shape of the structure to ensure it resembles the letter "H" and meets constraint 5.3.

9. If necessary, adjust the order and position of the drops to optimize stability and boundary intrusion, taking into account constraints 5.1 and 5.2.

By following these steps and considering the given constraints, the `ab_drop()` function can be used to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase letter "H" while meeting all the hard constraints.
