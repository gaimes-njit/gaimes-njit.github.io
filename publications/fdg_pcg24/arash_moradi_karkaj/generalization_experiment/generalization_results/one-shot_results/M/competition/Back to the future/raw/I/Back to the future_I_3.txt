To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "I", we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is a step-by-step approach to generate the structure:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Start building the structure from the bottom layer to the top layer.

Step 3: Drop the b31 block in the center of the structure to create the base.
```
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```
Coordinates: (15, 9)

Step 4: Drop three b11 blocks on top of the base to create the vertical line of the "I" character.
```
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 - 1)
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 + 1)
```
Coordinates: (14, 8), (14, 9), (14, 10)

Step 5: Drop a b13 block on top of the vertical line to complete the "I" character.
```
ab_drop('b13', W // 2)
```
Coordinates: (11, 9), (12, 9), (13, 9)

The final structure will resemble the uppercase character "I" and meet all the hard constraints.

Note: The soft constraint of not intruding on the boundary is not explicitly addressed in this solution. To meet this constraint, you may need to adjust the placement of the blocks or add additional checks while dropping the blocks.
