To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "L" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid: 
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```
2. Drop the b13 block at the bottom left corner (slot 0): 
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```
3. Drop the b31 block above the b13 block (slot 0): 
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```
4. Drop the b11 block above the b31 block (slot 0):
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

At this point, the structure will look like the uppercase letter "L". The complete sequence of ab_drop() calls can be represented as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

This sequence of drops satisfies the stability constraint, as each block is dropped in a stable position and provides support for the blocks above it. The resulting structure resembles the uppercase letter "L", as specified in the constraints.

Please note that this specific sequence of drops is just one possible solution that meets the constraints. There may be multiple valid solutions to create a stable structure resembling the letter "L".
