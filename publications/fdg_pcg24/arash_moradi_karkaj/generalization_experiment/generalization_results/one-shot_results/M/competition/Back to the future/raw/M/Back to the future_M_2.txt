To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "M" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the Map Initialization code provided. This creates an empty grid with dimensions WxH.
2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the center slot, aligning its center with the middle slot at layer 15. This will be the middle part of the "M" shape.
3. Check the stability of the structure after each drop using the given stability check. If the structure becomes unstable, adjust the position of the block by moving it to the left or right slot.
4. Once the middle part of the "M" shape is stable, drop two b13 blocks on either side of the b31 block, aligning their centers with the adjacent slots of the current layer.
5. Again, check the stability of the structure after each drop and make any necessary adjustments to ensure stability.
6. Drop two more b31 blocks on top of the b13 blocks, aligning their centers with the adjacent slots of the current layer.
7. Check stability and adjust positions if needed.
8. Finally, drop a b11 block above the middle part of the "M" shape, aligning its center with the center slot of the previous layer. This completes the "M" shape.
9. Perform a final stability check to ensure the entire structure is stable and does not collapse.

Here is an example implementation using the `ab_drop()` function:

```python
# Constants
W = 20
H = 16

# Initialize structure grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Function to check stability of structure
def is_stable():
    for i in range(H-1):
        for j in range(W):
            if structure[i][j] != ' ' and structure[i+1][j] == ' ':
                return False
    return True

# Drop a block at the given slot
def drop_block(block_type, slot):
    ab_drop(block_type, slot)
    print(f"Dropped {block_type} at slot {slot}")
    for row in structure:
        print(' '.join(row))
    print()

# Drop the middle part of the "M" shape
drop_block('b31', W // 2)

# Drop the side parts of the "M" shape
drop_block('b13', W // 2 - 1)
drop_block('b13', W // 2 + 1)

# Drop the upper parts of the "M" shape
drop_block('b31', W // 2 - 1)
drop_block('b31', W // 2 + 1)

# Drop the top part of the "M" shape
drop_block('b11', W // 2)

# Perform final stability check
if is_stable():
    print("Final structure is stable!")
else:
    print("Structure is not stable.")
```

Note: The above implementation assumes that the function `ab_drop()` is implemented correctly and handles the dropping and placement of blocks according to the given rules.
