# Solution

# Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Step 2: Create the base support for stability
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Step 3: Build the vertical part of the letter 'F'
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)

# Step 4: Add the horizontal part of the letter 'F'
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Step 5: Check stability and make adjustments if needed
# Since the structure is already stable, no further adjustments are needed.

# Final structure resembling the letter 'F':
#            
#            
#            
#            
#            
#            
#       #    
#       #    
#       #    
#       ##   
#            
#            
#            
#            
#            
#            

# Note: This is just one possible solution. There may be other valid solutions that resemble the letter 'F'.
