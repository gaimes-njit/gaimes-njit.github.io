To form the shape resembling the letter "D" using the given bricks and functions, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the field by creating a 2D array with dimensions 16x20, representing the 320 cells of the field.

2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to place bricks on the field according to the desired shape resembling the letter "D". We will start from the bottom and work our way up to ensure stability.

   a. Place a b31 brick at x_position = 9 to form the base of the letter "D". Use `ab_drop('b31', 9)`.

   b. Place a b13 brick at x_position = 9 above the base to form the straight vertical part of the letter "D". Use `ab_drop('b13', 9)`.

   c. Place a b11 brick at x_position = 10 above the straight vertical part to form the top part of the letter "D". Use `ab_drop('b11', 10)`.

3. Check the stability of the structure. For stability, we need to ensure that the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the point of contact between bricks is the same. In this case, the point of contact is the cell (9, 2) between the b31 and b13 bricks. Since the b11 brick is placed above this contact point, it does not affect stability.

4. Avoid boundary collisions. Make sure that the occupied cells of the bricks do not exceed the boundaries of the field. In this case, the placement of the bricks does not exceed the boundaries.

5. The resulting structure will resemble the letter "D" on the field.

Here is the code that generates the required structure:

```
# Map initialization
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Use the ab_drop() function to place bricks
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

After executing the above code, the cells in the field occupied by the placed bricks will form a shape resembling the letter "D".
