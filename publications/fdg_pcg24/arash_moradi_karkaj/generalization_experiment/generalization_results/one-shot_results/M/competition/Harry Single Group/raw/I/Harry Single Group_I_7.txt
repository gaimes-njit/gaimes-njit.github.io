To generate the shape resembling the letter "I", we can use a combination of the available bricks (b31, b13, and b11). 

First, let's initialize the field by creating a 2D array with dimensions 20x16 and filling it with zeros to represent empty cells. Each cell will be represented by a value of 0, and occupied cells will be represented by a value of 1.

```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, let's use the ab_drop() function to place the bricks on the field. We will start by dropping the b13 brick:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

This will occupy the cells (8, 0), (8, 1), and (8, 2) on the field.

Next, we will drop the b11 brick on top of the b13 brick:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

This will occupy the cell (8, 3) on the field.

Finally, we will drop the b31 brick next to the b13 brick:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

This will occupy the cells (4, 0), (5, 0), and (6, 0) on the field.

Here's the complete code:

```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # implementation of the ab_drop function
    
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

This will generate the required structure resembling the letter "I" while satisfying the important notes of stability and avoiding boundary collisions.
