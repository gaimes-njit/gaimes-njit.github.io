To generate the "W" shape using the available function ab_drop(x, y), we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the map as a 2D array of zeros with dimensions 20x16 to represent the field.
   ```python
   map = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
   ```

2. Place the first b13 brick at the bottom-left corner with x_position = 1.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

3. Place the second b13 brick above the first one with x_position = 6.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 6)
   ```

4. Place the first b31 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 2.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

5. Place the second b31 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 8.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ```

6. Place the first b13 brick above the second b31 brick with x_position = 3.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

7. Place the second b13 brick above the second b31 brick with x_position = 9.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

8. Place the first b31 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 4.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 4)
   ```

9. Place the second b31 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 10.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

10. Place the first b13 brick above the second b31 brick with x_position = 5.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 5)
   ```

11. Place the second b13 brick above the second b31 brick with x_position = 11.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 11)
   ```

12. Place the first b13 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 7.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 7)
   ```

13. Place the second b13 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 13.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 13)
   ```

14. Place the first b31 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 8.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ```

15. Place the second b31 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 14.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 14)
   ```

16. Place the first b13 brick above the second b31 brick with x_position = 9.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

17. Place the second b13 brick above the second b31 brick with x_position = 15.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 15)
   ```

18. Place the first b13 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 11.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 11)
   ```

19. Place the second b13 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 17.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 17)
   ```

20. Place the first b31 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 12.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 12)
   ```

21. Place the second b31 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 18.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 18)
   ```

22. Place the first b11 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 13.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 13)
   ```

23. Place the second b11 brick above the second b13 brick with x_position = 19.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 19)
   ```

Now, the map should represent the "W" shape as described.
