First, let's initialize the field by creating an empty map with a width of 20 and a height of 16:

```Python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Now, we can start placing the bricks to form the shape resembling the letter "W". We will be using the `ab_drop(x, y)` function to place the bricks.

```Python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    if x == 'b31':
        # To place a b31 brick at x_position y, we need to check if the cells (y-1, 0), (y, 0), and (y+1, 0) are empty
        if field[0][y-1] == 0 and field[0][y] == 0 and field[0][y+1] == 0:
            # Place the b31 brick at y_position y
            field[0][y-1] = 1
            field[0][y] = 1
            field[0][y+1] = 1
    elif x == 'b13':
        # To place a b13 brick at x_position y, we need to check if the cells (y, 0), (y, 1), and (y, 2) are empty
        if field[0][y] == 0 and field[1][y] == 0 and field[2][y] == 0:
            # Place the b13 brick at y_position y
            field[0][y] = 1
            field[1][y] = 1
            field[2][y] = 1
    elif x == 'b11':
        # To place a b11 brick at x_position y, we need to check if the cell (y, 0) is empty
        if field[0][y] == 0:
            # Place the b11 brick at y_position y
            field[0][y] = 1
```

Using the above function, we can generate the required structure. Here is an example:

```Python
# Place the first b31 brick at x_position 5
ab_drop('b31', 5)

# Place the first b13 brick at x_position 7
ab_drop('b13', 7)

# Place the second b13 brick at x_position 12
ab_drop('b13', 12)

# Place the second b31 brick at x_position 14
ab_drop('b31', 14)

# Place the third b31 brick at x_position 18
ab_drop('b31', 18)
```

After executing the above code, the field will contain the bricks forming the shape resembling the letter "W". Note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be multiple valid configurations.
