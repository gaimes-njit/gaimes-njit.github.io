In order to form the shape resembling the letter "Y", we need to place three bricks: one b13 brick and two b11 bricks.

First, let's initialize the field with an empty map:
```python
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, we can start placing the bricks using the ab_drop() function. We'll ensure stability and avoid boundary collisions by checking the conditions before placing each brick.

1. Place the b13 brick:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
This will occupy the cells (9, 0), (9, 1), and (9, 2). This is the stem of the "Y" shape.

2. Place the two b11 bricks:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
The first b11 brick occupies the cell (8, 3), and the second b11 brick occupies the cell (10, 3). These are the branches of the "Y" shape.

Finally, let's print the final state of the field to visualize the generated structure:
```python
for row in field:
    print(row)
```

The output will be:
```
