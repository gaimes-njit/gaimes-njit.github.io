To form a shape resembling the letter "Z", we will need to use the b13 brick and the b31 brick. 

First, let's place the b13 brick vertically on the ground at x_position = 5 using ab_drop('b13', 5). This will occupy the cells (5, 0), (5, 1), and (5, 2).

Next, we will place the b31 brick horizontally just above the b13 brick. To ensure stability, we need to align the pivot point (middle cell) of the b31 brick with the pivot point of the b13 brick. Since the b13 brick occupies the cells (5, 0), (5, 1), and (5, 2), the pivot point will be at (5, 1). 

We can place the b31 brick starting from x_position = 4, which aligns its pivot point with the pivot point of the b13 brick. However, we need to make sure that the b31 brick does not exceed the boundaries of the field. Since the b31 brick has a width of 3, we can place it at x_position = 5, 6, or 7 without exceeding the boundaries.

Let's choose x_position = 5 and use ab_drop('b31', 5). This will occupy the cells (5, 3), (6, 3), and (7, 3) with the b31 brick.

Here is the code to generate the required structure:

```
# Initialize the field
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Place the b13 brick vertically on the ground
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Place the b31 brick horizontally above the b13 brick
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

Please note that the provided code is a template, and the `ab_drop` function needs to be implemented separately according to the requirements in the game.
