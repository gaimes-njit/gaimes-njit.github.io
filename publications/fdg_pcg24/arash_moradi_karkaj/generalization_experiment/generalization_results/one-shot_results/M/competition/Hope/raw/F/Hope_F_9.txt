To create the letter "F" inside a 20x16 box, you can use the ab_drop() function with different block types and positions. Here's the sequence of commands to achieve that:

1. Drop a b31 block at position 0:
   ab_drop('b31', 0)

2. Drop a b11 block at position 0:
   ab_drop('b11', 0)

3. Drop a b11 block at position 0:
   ab_drop('b11', 0)

4. Drop a b11 block at position 0:
   ab_drop('b11', 0)

5. Drop a b31 block at position 7:
   ab_drop('b31', 7)

6. Drop a b13 block at position 0:
   ab_drop('b13', 0)

7. Drop a b13 block at position 0:
   ab_drop('b13', 0)

8. Drop a b13 block at position 0:
   ab_drop('b13', 0)

Note: The order of the commands may vary depending on the specific requirements or constraints of the ab_drop() function. This sequence assumes that the blocks are dropped from left to right.
