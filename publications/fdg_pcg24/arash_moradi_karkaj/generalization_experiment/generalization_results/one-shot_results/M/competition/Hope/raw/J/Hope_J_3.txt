To create a "J" shape using `ab_drop('blocktype', x position)`, you would need to drop the blocks in the following sequence:

1. Drop a b13 block at position (0, 0)
2. Drop a b11 block at position (1, 0)
3. Drop a b11 block at position (2, 0)
4. Drop a b31 block at position (2, 1)

Here is the code to create the "J" shape:

ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)

The resulting structure would be:

```
bb 
bx 
bx 
bx
```
where 'b' represents a block and 'x' represents an empty space. The structure fits within a 20x16 box starting from position (0, 0).
