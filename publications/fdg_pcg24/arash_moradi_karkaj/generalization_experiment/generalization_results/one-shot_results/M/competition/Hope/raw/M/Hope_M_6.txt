To create a structure of the letter "M" inside a 20*16 box using the ab_drop function, we can break it down into smaller components and position them accordingly.

Here's the solution:
- Drop a b13 (1*3 block) starting at position (0, 0)
- Drop a b13 (1*3 block) starting at position (1, 0)
- Drop a b11 (1*1 block) starting at position (2, 1)
- Drop a b11 (1*1 block) starting at position (3, 2)
- Drop a b31 (3*1 block) starting at position (4, 3)
- Drop a b11 (1*1 block) starting at position (7, 2)
- Drop a b11 (1*1 block) starting at position (8, 1)
- Drop a b13 (1*3 block) starting at position (9, 0)
- Drop a b13 (1*3 block) starting at position (10, 0)

The resulting structure will resemble the letter "M" inside a 20*16 box.
