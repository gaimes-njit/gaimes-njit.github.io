To generate the uppercase letter "B", we need to create a combination of horizontal and vertical blocks in a Tetris-like environment with gravity rules.

Here is a step-by-step solution to generate the letter "B":

1. Start by placing vertical foundations from the top of the grid. Use the ab_drop() command with the block type 'b13' and the corresponding X positions:
   ab_drop('b13',1)
   ab_drop('b13',3)
   ab_drop('b13',4)
   ab_drop('b13',6)

2. Next, place the top horizontal blocks to complete the letter "B". Use the ab_drop() command with the block type 'b31' and the corresponding X positions:
   ab_drop('b31',2)
   ab_drop('b31',5)

By following these steps, you should be able to generate the uppercase letter "B" using the given block types and within the defined environment.

Please note that it's important to place the blocks consecutively and ensure structural stability by taking into account the gravity rules.
