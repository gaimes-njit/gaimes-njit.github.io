To generate the uppercase English letter "Q" using the ab_drop() command and the given block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Start with the vertical foundation of the letter:
   - ab_drop('b13',1)
   - ab_drop('b13',3)
   - ab_drop('b13',4)
   - ab_drop('b13',6)

2. Create the horizontal tops of the letter:
   - ab_drop('b31',2)
   - ab_drop('b31',5)

By executing these commands consecutively, the blocks will be placed in the Tetris-like environment to form the uppercase letter "Q" with proper stacking and stability, while adhering to the gravity rules and space boundaries.

Please note that the specific positions of the blocks may depend on the exact dimensions of the block types and the spacing between them in the given environment.
