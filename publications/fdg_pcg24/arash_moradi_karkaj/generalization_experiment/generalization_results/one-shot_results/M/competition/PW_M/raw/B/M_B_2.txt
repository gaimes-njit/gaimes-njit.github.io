To generate the uppercase letter "B" using the provided block types and environment constraints, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the vertical foundations of the letter. Place three vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions (1,1), (3,1), (4,1), and (6,1) using the `ab_drop()` command:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
```

2. Next, create the tops of the letter. Place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) at positions (2,1) and (5,1) using the `ab_drop()` command:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```

By following these steps and executing the provided commands consecutively, you will be able to generate the uppercase letter "B" within the given environment and constraints.
