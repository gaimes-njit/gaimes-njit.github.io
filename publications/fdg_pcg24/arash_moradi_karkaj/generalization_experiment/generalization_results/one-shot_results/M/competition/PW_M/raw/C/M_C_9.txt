To generate the uppercase English letter "C" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the vertical foundation by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 along the width:
```py
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the second vertical block at position 5 along the width:
```py
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at the top right corner of the previous block, at position 6 along the width:
```py
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

These commands will create the uppercase English letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries, adhering to the gravity rules.
