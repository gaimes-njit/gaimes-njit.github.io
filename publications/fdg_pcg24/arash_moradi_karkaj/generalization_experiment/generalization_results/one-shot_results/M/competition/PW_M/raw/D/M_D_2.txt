To create the uppercase letter "D" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

This will first create the vertical foundation of the letter "D" using the b13 block type at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. Then, it will create the top portion of the letter "D" using the b31 block type at positions 2, 5, and 8. 

This sequence of commands ensures structural stability and fits within the allowed space boundaries.
