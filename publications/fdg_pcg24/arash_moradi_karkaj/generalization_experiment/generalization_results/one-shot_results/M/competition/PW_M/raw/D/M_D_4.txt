To generate the uppercase letter "D", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 12)
```

By following these commands, you will stack the appropriate block types in the correct positions to form the letter "D" in the defined environment.
