To generate the uppercase letter "E" using the given block types, you need to follow these steps:

1. Start by placing the vertical foundation for the letter "E" using the `ab_drop('b13',x)` command. Place the blocks at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6 on the width. This will create the vertical bars of the letter "E".

``` 
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
```

2. Next, place the horizontal bars of the letter "E" using the `ab_drop('b31',x)` command. Place the blocks at positions 2 and 5 on the width. This will create the middle and bottom bars of the letter "E".

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```

By following these steps and executing the given ab_drop() commands consecutively, you will be able to generate the uppercase letter "E" in the Tetris-like environment.

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "E" is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```
