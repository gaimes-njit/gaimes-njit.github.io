To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing three vertical straight blocks (b13) in positions 1, 2, and 3 along the width. This forms the vertical line of the letter "F".
- Then, we place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) in positions 1 and 3 along the width. These blocks form the horizontal line at the top of the letter "F".

The resulting shape will resemble the uppercase letter "F" within the defined environment.
