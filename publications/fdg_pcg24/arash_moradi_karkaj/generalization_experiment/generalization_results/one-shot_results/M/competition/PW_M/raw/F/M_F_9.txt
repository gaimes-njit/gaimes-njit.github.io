To generate the uppercase English letter "F" using the given block types in the defined environment, the following stream of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the first vertical foundation block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place the second vertical foundation block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',4)  # Place the third vertical foundation block at position 4
ab_drop('b13',6)  # Place the fourth vertical foundation block at position 6
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place the top horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',5)  # Place the middle horizontal block at position 5
```

The above commands will create an uppercase "F" letter shape in the Tetris-like environment, following the defined 2D gravity rules.
