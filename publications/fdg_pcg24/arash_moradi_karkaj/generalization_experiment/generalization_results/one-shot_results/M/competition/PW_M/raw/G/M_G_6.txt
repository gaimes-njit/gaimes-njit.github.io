To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) right next to the previous block at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) right next to the previous block at position 4:
```
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

4. Place another vertical straight block (b13) right next to the previous block at position 6:
```
ab_drop('b13',6)
```

5. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the first vertical block at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

6. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the last vertical block at position 5:
```
ab_drop('b31',5)
```

The complete solution to generate the letter "G" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```
