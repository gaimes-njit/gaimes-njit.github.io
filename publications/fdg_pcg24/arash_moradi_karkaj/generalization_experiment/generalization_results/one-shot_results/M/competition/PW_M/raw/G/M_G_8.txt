To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the vertical foundation of the letter. This can be done by using the `ab_drop('b13', x)` command, where `x` represents the position along the width. Place the blocks at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. This will create the vertical bars of the letter.

2. Next, create the top part of the letter. Use the `ab_drop('b31', x)` command to create horizontal blocks. Place them at positions 2 and 5. This will create the top part of the letter.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "G":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```

By following these steps and executing the provided commands, the uppercase English letter "G" will be generated in the Tetris-like environment.
