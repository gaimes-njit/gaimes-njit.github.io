To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can use the following stream of commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1 to create the top of the letter.
2. Place a 1x1 square block (`b11`) at position 5 for the upper-right corner of the letter.
3. Place another 1x1 square block (`b11`) at position 4 for the lower-right corner of the letter.
4. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 2 for the left side of the letter.
5. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1 for the bottom-left corner of the letter.
6. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 3 for the top-left corner of the letter.
7. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 5 for the bottom-right corner of the letter.
8. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 1 for the inner-left part of the letter.
9. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 3 for the inner-right part of the letter.

This sequence of commands will result in the formation of the uppercase letter "G" within the given boundaries and gravity rules.
