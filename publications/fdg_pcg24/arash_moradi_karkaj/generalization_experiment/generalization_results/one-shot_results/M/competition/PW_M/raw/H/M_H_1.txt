To generate the uppercase English letter "H", we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the vertical foundations by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at positions 1 and 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the vertical foundations at position 1:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the vertical foundations at position 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

4. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other on top of the horizontal blocks, starting from position 1:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

Here is the complete stream of commands to generate the letter "H":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively to achieve the desired shape and stability.
