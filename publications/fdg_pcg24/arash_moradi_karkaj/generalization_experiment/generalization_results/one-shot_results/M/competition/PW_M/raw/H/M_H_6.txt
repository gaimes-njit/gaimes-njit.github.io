To generate the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start with the two vertical foundations:
   - Place a vertical block of type "b13" at position 1: `ab_drop('b13',1)`
   - Place a vertical block of type "b13" at position 3: `ab_drop('b13',3)`

2. Place the horizontal bar at the top:
   - Place a horizontal block of type "b31" at position 2: `ab_drop('b31',2)`
   - Place a horizontal block of type "b31" at position 5: `ab_drop('b31',5)`

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the letter "H" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```

By following these commands, you can create the uppercase letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries and considering the gravity rules.
