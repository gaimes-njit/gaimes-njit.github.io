To create the uppercase letter H, we can use a combination of block types b13 and b31. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands needed to construct the letter H:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the left pillar of the H
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place the right pillar of the H
ab_drop('b13',4)  # Place the middle bar of the H
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place the top bar of the H
ab_drop('b31',5)  # Place the bottom bar of the H
```

By following these commands in order, the resulting shapes will form the uppercase letter H within the allowed space boundaries.
