To generate the uppercase English letter "J", you can follow these steps:

1. Place the vertical foundation blocks starting from position 1:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

2. Add the horizontal top block on top of the foundation at position 2:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Your final result should resemble the uppercase letter "J":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
