To generate the letter "K" using the given block types and gravity rules, you can follow these steps:

1. Start with the vertical foundations by placing three vertical straight blocks (b13) in positions 1, 3, and 4 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

2. Place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) on top of the second and fifth positions to create the top part of the letter "K":
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

By following these steps and executing the provided commands consecutively, you will be able to generate the uppercase English letter "K" while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules defined.
