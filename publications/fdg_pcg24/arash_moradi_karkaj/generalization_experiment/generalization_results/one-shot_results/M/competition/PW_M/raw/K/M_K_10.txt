To generate the letter "K", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start with the vertical foundation:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ab_drop('b13', 4)
   ab_drop('b13', 6)
   ```

2. Add the top parts of the letter:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ab_drop('b31', 5)
   ```

With these commands, the blocks will be placed in a Tetris-like environment to form the uppercase letter "K".
