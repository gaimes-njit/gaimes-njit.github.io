To generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Explanation:
- First, we start by placing three vertical straight blocks (b13) in positions 1, 2, and 3 to create the left vertical part of the letter "K".
- Then, we place a horizontal straight block (b31) in position 4 to create the middle part of the letter "K".
- After that, we continue with two vertical straight blocks (b13) in positions 5 and 6 to create the right vertical part of the letter "K".
- Finally, we complete the letter "K" by placing three more vertical straight blocks (b13) in positions 7, 8, and 9.

This sequence of commands ensures that the blocks are stacked and stable, following the gravity rules, and form the uppercase letter "K" within the allowed space boundaries.
