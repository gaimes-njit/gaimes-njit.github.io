To generate the uppercase letter "K" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

Explanation:
- The first four commands create the vertical foundations of the letter "K" by stacking four vertical straight blocks (b13) in the positions indicated.
- The next two commands create the tops of the letter "K" by stacking two horizontal straight blocks (b31) in the positions indicated.
- The last four commands create the middle and bottom parts of the letter "K" by stacking four 1x1 square blocks (b11) in a horizontal line.

By executing these commands consecutively, you will generate the uppercase letter "K" with stability and within the allowed space boundaries.
