To generate the uppercase English letter "K", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

This command sequence will create the vertical foundations of the letter "K" using block type b13, starting at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. Then, the horizontal bar of the letter "K" will be formed using block type b31 at positions 2 and 5.

Make sure to follow the gravity rules and stack the blocks accordingly to achieve a stable and accurate representation of the letter "K" within the allowed space.
