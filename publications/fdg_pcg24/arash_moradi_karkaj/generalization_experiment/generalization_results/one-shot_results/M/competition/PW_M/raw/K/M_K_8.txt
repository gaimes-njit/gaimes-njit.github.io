To generate the uppercase letter "K" using the block types and commands provided, we need to create the vertical and horizontal components of the letter separately and then combine them to form the final shape. Here are the steps to create the letter "K":

1. Start by creating the vertical component of the letter. Place four vertical blocks (b13) at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6 along the width. This forms the letter's vertical foundations. Use the ab_drop() command as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
```

2. Next, create the horizontal component of the letter. Place two horizontal blocks (b31) at positions 2 and 5 along the width. This forms the tops of the letter. Use the ab_drop() command as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```

3. Finally, combine the vertical and horizontal components by stacking them together. This will result in the letter "K" shape. The complete stream of commands is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```

By executing these commands consecutively, you will generate the uppercase letter "K" in the Tetris-like environment.
