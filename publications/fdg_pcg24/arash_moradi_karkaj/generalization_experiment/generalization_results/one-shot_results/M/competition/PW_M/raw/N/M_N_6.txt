To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

This set of commands constructs the letter "N" by stacking the block types in the defined environment with the given gravity rules.
