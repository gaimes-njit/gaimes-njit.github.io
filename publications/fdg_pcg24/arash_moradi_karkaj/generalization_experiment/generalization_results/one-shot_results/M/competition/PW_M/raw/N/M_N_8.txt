To generate the uppercase English letter "N", you can use the following stream of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 2.
3. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 4.
4. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 5.
5. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 7.

This sequence of commands will create the letter "N" in the given environment, following the stacking and stability rules with respect to gravity.
