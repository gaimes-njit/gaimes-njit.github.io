To generate the uppercase letter "P" using the provided block types and commands, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the vertical foundation for the left side of the letter. Place the vertical straight block 'b13' at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6 in the first row. 
   ```
   ab_drop('b13',1)
   ab_drop('b13',3)
   ab_drop('b13',4)
   ab_drop('b13',6)
   ```

2. Add the horizontal top part of the letter. Place the horizontal straight block 'b31' at positions 2 and 5 in the second row.
   ```
   ab_drop('b31',2)
   ab_drop('b31',5)
   ```

Executing these commands consecutively will result in the uppercase letter "P" being created in the Tetris-like environment.
