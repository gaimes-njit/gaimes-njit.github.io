To generate the uppercase English letter "P", we can proceed as follows:

1. Start with the vertical foundation by placing two vertical straight blocks ('b13') side by side on the left side of the grid:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

2. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') on the right side of the existing blocks to complete the vertical structure:
```
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

3. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') on top of the vertical structure, slightly to the right:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block ('b31') on top of the vertical structure, slightly to the left:
```
ab_drop('b31',5)
```

The complete set of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "P" is as follows:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',2)
