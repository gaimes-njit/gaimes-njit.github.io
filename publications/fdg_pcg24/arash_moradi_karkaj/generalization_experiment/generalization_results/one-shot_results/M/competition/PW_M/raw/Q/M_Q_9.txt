Instruction:

To create the uppercase letter "Q" using the given block types and environment, you can follow the steps below:

1. Start by creating the vertical foundations for the letter "Q" using the b13 block type. Place four b13 blocks consecutively along the width at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. Use the ab_drop() command to place each block. (Reminder: The X position starts from 1)

   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ab_drop('b13', 4)
   ab_drop('b13', 6)
   ```

2. Next, create the tops of the letter "Q" using the b31 block type. Place two b31 blocks consecutively along the width at positions 2 and 5. Use the ab_drop() command to place each block.

   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ab_drop('b31', 5)
   ```

The above commands will create the uppercase letter "Q" within the given environment while preserving the stacking and stability rules.
