To generate the uppercase English letter "R", we can start by creating the vertical foundation of the letter using the vertical straight block (b13). Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place the second vertical block next to the first one
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place the third vertical block next to the second one
ab_drop('b31',4)   # Place the horizontal block on top of the second vertical block
ab_drop('b31',5)   # Place the horizontal block next to the fourth vertical block
ab_drop('b13',6)   # Place the fifth vertical block next to the fifth horizontal block
ab_drop('b13',7)   # Place the sixth vertical block next to the fifth vertical block
ab_drop('b11',6)   # Place a small square block on top of the sixth vertical block
ab_drop('b11',4)   # Place a small square block on top of the fourth vertical block
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "R" within the defined boundaries of the grid.
