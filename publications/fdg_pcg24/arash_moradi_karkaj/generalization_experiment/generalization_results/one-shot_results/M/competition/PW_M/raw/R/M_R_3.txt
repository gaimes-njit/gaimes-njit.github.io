To generate the uppercase letter "R" using the mentioned command and block types, follow these steps:

1. Start with the vertical foundation by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) side by side from left to right:
   - ab_drop('b13', 1)
   - ab_drop('b13', 2)

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the vertical foundation to connect the two vertical blocks:
   - ab_drop('b31', 1)

3. Add another vertical straight block (b13) on the right side of the horizontal block to form the right leg of the "R":
   - ab_drop('b13', 2)

4. To complete the structure of the "R", place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the right leg:
   - ab_drop('b31', 1)

The final sequence of commands to generate the uppercase letter "R" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
