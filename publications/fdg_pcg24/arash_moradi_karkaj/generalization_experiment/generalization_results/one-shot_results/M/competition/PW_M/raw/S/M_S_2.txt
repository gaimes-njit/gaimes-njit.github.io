To generate the uppercase letter "S" using the given block types in the defined environment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the vertical foundations of the letter "S" by dropping two vertical straight blocks (b13) in positions 1 and 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Drop two horizontal straight blocks (b31) on top of the vertical foundations to create the top part of the letter "S". Place them in positions 2 and 5 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

3. Finally, drop a vertical straight block (b13) in position 4 along the width to complete the bottom part of the letter "S":
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

The complete sequence of commands to generate the uppercase letter "S" is as follows:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```
