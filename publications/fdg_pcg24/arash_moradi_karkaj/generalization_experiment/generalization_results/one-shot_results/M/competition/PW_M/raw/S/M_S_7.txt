To generate the uppercase English letter "S," we can start with the vertical foundations and tops as shown in the example for the letter "M." However, we need to modify the positions of these blocks to form the letter "S." Here is the modified stream of commands to generate the letter "S":

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

By executing these commands in the given environment, the blocks will stack on top of each other to form the uppercase letter "S" with accurate representation and within the allowed boundaries.
