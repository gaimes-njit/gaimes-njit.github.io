To generate the uppercase English letter "T" in the given environment, we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place the vertical foundation on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place the vertical foundation in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place the vertical foundation on the right side
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place the horizontal top part of the letter
ab_drop('b31', 5)   # Place the horizontal top part of the letter
```

These commands will construct the uppercase letter "T" accurately and ensure stability within the defined boundaries of the environment.
