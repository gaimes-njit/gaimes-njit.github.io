To generate the uppercase letter "T", we need to place the blocks in a specific pattern. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Start with the vertical foundation of the letter "T" by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 3 along the width:
   ```ab_drop('b13',1) ab_drop('b13',3)```

2. Add the horizontal top of the letter "T" by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width:
   ```ab_drop('b31',2)```

3. Finally, to complete the top part of the letter "T", place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 5 along the width:
   ```ab_drop('b31',5)```

The complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "T" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13',1) ab_drop('b13',3) ab_drop('b31',2) ab_drop('b31',5)
```
