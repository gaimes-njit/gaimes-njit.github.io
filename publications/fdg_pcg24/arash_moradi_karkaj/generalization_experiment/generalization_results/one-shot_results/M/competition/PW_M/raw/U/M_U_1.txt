Here are the commands to generate the uppercase letter U:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

Explanation:
1. Start with the horizontal foundation using `b31` block type at position 1.
2. Place the vertical bars using `b13` block type at positions 3 and 5.
3. Place the horizontal top using `b31` block type at position 7.
4. Complete the letter U by placing the vertical bars using `b13` block type at positions 9 and 11.

The resulting letter U should fit within the allowed space boundaries and maintain stability according to the gravity rules.
