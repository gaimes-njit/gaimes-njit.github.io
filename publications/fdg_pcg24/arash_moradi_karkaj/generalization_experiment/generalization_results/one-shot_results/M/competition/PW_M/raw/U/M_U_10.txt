To create the uppercase English letter "U" using the given block types, we need to first build the vertical foundations and then add the tops.

We can start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) side by side to create the left side of the "U":
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Next, we need to add two vertical straight blocks with a gap in the middle to create the right side of the "U":
```
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
```

Finally, we can add two horizontal straight blocks (b31) on top of the vertical foundations to complete the "U":
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "U" is as follows:
```


ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)

```

Please note that the commands should be run consecutively from top to bottom to create the desired shape within the allowed space boundaries.
