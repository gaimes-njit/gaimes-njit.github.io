To generate the uppercase English letter "U," we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing a vertical foundation on the left side of the grid with `ab_drop('b13', 1)`.
- Then, we place two horizontal blocks on top of the vertical foundation to form the top part of the "U" shape with `ab_drop('b31', 2)` and `ab_drop('b31', 5)`.
- Next, we place another vertical block on the right side of the grid to complete the right side of the "U" shape with `ab_drop('b13', 6)`.
- Finally, we place two horizontal blocks on top of the right vertical block to close the top part of the "U" shape with `ab_drop('b13', 8)` and `ab_drop('b31', 9)`.

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "U" within the allowed space boundaries and following the 2D gravity rules.
