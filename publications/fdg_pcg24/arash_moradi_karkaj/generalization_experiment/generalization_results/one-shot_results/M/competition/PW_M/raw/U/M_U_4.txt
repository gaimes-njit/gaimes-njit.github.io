To create the uppercase letter "U", we need to stack blocks in a specific pattern. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "U":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b31',7)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2.
3. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 4.
4. Place the final vertical straight block ('b13') at position 6.
5. Finally, place the top horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 7 to complete the letter "U".

Make sure to follow the given environment and gravity rules to ensure the stability of the letter.
