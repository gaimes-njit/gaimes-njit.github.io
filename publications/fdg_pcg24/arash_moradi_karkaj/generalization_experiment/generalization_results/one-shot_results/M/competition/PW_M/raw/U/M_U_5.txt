To generate the uppercase English letter "U" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start with the left vertical foundation of the letter "U" by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width to connect the two vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31',2)
```

3. Continue building the left side of the letter "U" by placing three additional vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1, 2, and 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 along the width to connect the three vertical blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

5. Complete the letter "U" by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31',4)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "U" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b31',4)
```
