To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

This will first create the vertical foundations of the letter "V" using the 'b13' block type and position them at x = 1, 3, 5, and 7. Then, it will create the top of the letter "V" using the 'b31' block type and position them at x = 2 and 8. This arrangement of blocks will accurately represent the uppercase letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries.
