To generate the uppercase English letter "V" using the block types provided, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the vertical foundations of the letter "V". This can be done by placing four vertical blocks next to each other, starting from the leftmost position. Use the ab_drop() command with the 'b13' block type to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

2. Next, create the tops of the letter "V". Place two horizontal blocks on top of the vertical foundations. Use the ab_drop() command with the 'b31' block type to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

By following these steps, you should be able to generate the uppercase English letter "V" within the defined environment and gravity rules.
