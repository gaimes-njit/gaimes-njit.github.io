To generate an uppercase English letter "V" using the given command and block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing the vertical foundations of the letter "V" using the b13 block type. Position the first block at (1,1), the second block at (1,3), the third block at (1,4), and the fourth block at (1,6). This creates the shape of the two sides of the letter "V". Use the ab_drop() command for each block placement.

2. Place the tops of the letter "V" using the b31 block type. Position the first top block at (2,2) and the second top block at (2,5). This creates the connecting part of the letter "V" between the two sides. Use the ab_drop() command for each block placement.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "V":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',5)
```
