To generate the letter "V" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing the two vertical foundations:
   ```ab_drop('b13',1)
   ab_drop('b13',3)
   ```

2. Place the horizontal top of the "V":
   ```ab_drop('b31',2)
   ab_drop('b31',5)
   ```

This will create a capital letter "V" using the given block types and following the 2D gravity rules.
