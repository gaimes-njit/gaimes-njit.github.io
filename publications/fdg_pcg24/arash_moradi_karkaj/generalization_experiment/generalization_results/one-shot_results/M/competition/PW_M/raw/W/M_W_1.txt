To generate the uppercase letter "W", we need to carefully stack the block types in a way that resembles the letter. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical foundation on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Stack another vertical block next to the first one
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Stack one more vertical block next to the previous two
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place a horizontal block on top of the third vertical block
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Stack another horizontal block next to the previous one
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Stack one more horizontal block next to the previous two
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Stack a vertical block on top of the rightmost horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Stack another vertical block next to the previous one
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Stack one more vertical block next to the previous two
```

This sequence of commands will result in a stable structure resembling the uppercase letter "W".
