To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b31',6)
```

Explanation:
- First, we start with the vertical foundations of the letter "W" by placing four vertical blocks ('b13') in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Then, we place three horizontal blocks ('b31') to form the tops of the letter "W". These horizontal blocks are placed in positions 2, 4, and 6.

By following these commands, you will generate the uppercase English letter "W" within the allowed space and according to the gravity rules.
