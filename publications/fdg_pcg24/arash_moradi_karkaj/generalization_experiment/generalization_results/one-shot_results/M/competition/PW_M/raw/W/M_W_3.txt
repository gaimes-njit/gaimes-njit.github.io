To generate the uppercase letter "W", we can use a combination of vertical and horizontal blocks. Here are the steps to create the letter "W" using the ab_drop() command:

1. Start with the vertical foundation by placing three vertical blocks next to each other:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place a vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 5)   # Place a vertical block at position 5
```

2. Add the diagonal lines of the letter "W" using horizontal blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place a horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place a horizontal block at position 4
```

The final result should look like the letter "W" within the defined boundaries of the grid.

Here is the complete set of commands to generate the letter "W":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
