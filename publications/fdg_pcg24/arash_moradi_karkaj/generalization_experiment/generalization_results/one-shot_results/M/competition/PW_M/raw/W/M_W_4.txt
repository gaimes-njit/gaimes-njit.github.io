To generate the uppercase letter "W", we need to carefully stack and position the blocks in a way that represents the shape of the letter. Here's how we can accomplish this task using the provided block types and commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)    # Place the first vertical foundation block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',2)    # Place the top left slanted block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',4)    # Place the middle vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',5)    # Place the top right slanted block at position 5
ab_drop('b13',7)    # Place the final vertical block at position 7
```
By following these commands in sequence, we can construct an uppercase letter "W" using the given block types and the defined environment.
