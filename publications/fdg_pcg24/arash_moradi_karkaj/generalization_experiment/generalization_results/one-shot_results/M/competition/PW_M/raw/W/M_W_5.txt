To construct the letter "W", we will need to strategically place the blocks in a way that resembles the shape of the letter. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the second vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the third horizontal block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place the third vertical block at position 6
```

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively in the given order.
