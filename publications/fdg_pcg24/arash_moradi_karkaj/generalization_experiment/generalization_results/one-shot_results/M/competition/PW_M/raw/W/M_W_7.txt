To generate the uppercase English letter "W" using the mentioned command and block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Start with the vertical foundations by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) one after the other. This will form the two outer legs of the "W".
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the left leg to create the top-left section of the "W".
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the right leg to create the top-right section of the "W".
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

4. Place another vertical straight block (b13) on top of the left section to create the middle section of the "W".
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

5. Place another vertical straight block (b13) on top of the right section to create the middle section of the "W".
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

Your final arrangement of blocks should resemble the uppercase English letter "W" within the defined environment.
