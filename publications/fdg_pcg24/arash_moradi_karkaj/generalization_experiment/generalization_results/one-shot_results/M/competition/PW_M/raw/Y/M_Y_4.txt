To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical foundations using the 'b13' block type. Place the first block at position 1 and the second block at position 3. This will create the two vertical lines of the letter Y.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Next, place a horizontal block using the 'b31' block type to connect the two vertical lines. Place this block at position 2.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Finally, place another horizontal block using the 'b31' block type at position 2 to complete the top part of the letter Y.

```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

Overall, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "Y" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```
