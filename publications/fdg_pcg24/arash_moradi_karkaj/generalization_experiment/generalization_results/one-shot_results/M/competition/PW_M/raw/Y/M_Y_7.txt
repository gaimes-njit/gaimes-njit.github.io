To create the uppercase letter "Y" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the second vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the third vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place the fourth vertical block at position 6
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal top block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the horizontal bottom block at position 5
```

This sequence of commands will construct a stable formation of blocks that resembles the uppercase letter "Y" within the allowed space boundaries.
