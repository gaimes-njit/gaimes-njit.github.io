To generate the uppercase letter "Z", we can break it down into two parts: the vertical stroke and the diagonal stroke. Here's the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "Z":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  // Place the first vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)  // Place the second vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',5)  // Place the third vertical block at position 5
ab_drop('b31',2)  // Place the diagonal block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',4)  // Place the dot at position 4
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "Z" within the allowed space boundaries, taking into account the 2D gravity rules.
