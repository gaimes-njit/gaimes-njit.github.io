To generate the uppercase letter "Z" using the given block types and command, here's the stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "Z" in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules. Each command places a block one by one to construct the letter accurately while maintaining stability within the allowed space boundaries.
