To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all hard constraints, the following step-by-step approach can be taken:

1. Define the size of the structure by initializing the structure variable as an empty grid of width W = 20 and height H = 16.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by placing the base block (b11) at the bottom layer (layer 0) and in the middle slot (slot 10). Use the ab_drop() function to drop the block.
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

3. Place the vertical blocks (b13) on the left and right sides of the base block to form the vertical parts of the "F" character. Drop the blocks at slots 9 and 11, respectively.
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

4. Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the base block to form the horizontal part of the "F" character. Drop the block at slot 9.
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

5. To meet the stability constraint, make sure that the b31 block is placed on a solid base. Since the base block (b11) is already present, the stability requirement is satisfied.

6. The structure should not be separated, meaning all blocks should be connected. By following the above steps, we ensure that all blocks are placed adjacent to each other, satisfying this constraint.

7. To avoid boundary intrusion, ensure that all blocks are dropped within the boundaries of the structure. By using the ab_drop() function, the blocks will be dropped within the available slots of the structure, satisfying this constraint.

After performing the above steps, the structure will resemble the character "F" and meet all the given requirements.
