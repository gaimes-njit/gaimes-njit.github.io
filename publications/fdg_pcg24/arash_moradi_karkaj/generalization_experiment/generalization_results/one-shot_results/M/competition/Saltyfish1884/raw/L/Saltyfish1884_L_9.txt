To generate a structure that resembles the character "L" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place a b11 block at the bottom layer, centered at slot 10.
ab_drop("b11", 10)

Step 2: Place a b11 block above the previous block, centered at slot 10.
ab_drop("b11", 10)

Step 3: Place a b11 block above and to the left of the previous block, centered at slot 9.
ab_drop("b11", 9)

Step 4: Place a b11 block above and to the left of the previous block, centered at slot 8.
ab_drop("b11", 8)

Step 5: Place a b31 block above the previous block, centered at slot 9.
ab_drop("b31", 9)

Step 6: Place a b13 block above and to the left of the previous block, centered at slot 4.
ab_drop("b13", 4)

The resulting structure will resemble the character "L" and meet all the stability and boundary constraints.
