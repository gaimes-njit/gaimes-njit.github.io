To generate a stable structure resembling the character "Q" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop a b11 block at slot 6 to form the base of the structure:
```
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 5 on top of the base:
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

4. Drop a b13 block at slot 7 on top of the base:
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

5. Drop a b13 block at slot 6 on top of the previous b13 blocks to complete the outer shape of the "Q":
```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

6. Drop a b31 block at slot 6 on top of the outer shape to fill the inner space of the "Q":
```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

7. The final structure will resemble the character "Q".

Make sure to follow the stability rules and constraints mentioned in the problem statement while determining the dropping positions and order of the blocks.
