To generate a stable structure resembling the character "U" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid as an empty WxH grid.

Step 2: Place a b31 block on the base layer (layer 0) at the center slot (y = W/2) using the ab_drop() function. This ensures stability by providing a solid base for the structure.

Step 3: Place two b13 blocks on top of the b31 block, aligned with its sides. This forms the sides of the "U" shape. Use the ab_drop() function to place the blocks one by one, starting from a lower layer and moving upwards. Place the left b13 block at y = W/2 - 1 and the right b13 block at y = W/2 + 1.

Step 4: Place a b31 block on top of the left b13 block, aligned with its top side. Use the ab_drop() function to place the block at y = W/2 - 1. This connects the left side of the "U" shape to the top part.

Step 5: Place a b31 block on top of the right b13 block, aligned with its top side. Use the ab_drop() function to place the block at y = W/2 + 1. This connects the right side of the "U" shape to the top part.

Step 6: Place a b31 block on top of the previous two b31 blocks, aligned with their top sides. Use the ab_drop() function to place the block at y = W/2. This completes the top part of the "U" shape.

Step 7: The resulting structure should resemble the character "U" and meet all stability constraints. The ab_drop() function ensures that the blocks are dropped in a stable position, satisfying the stability rules. The structure should also not intrude on the map's boundary, satisfying the no boundary intrusion constraint.

Here is an example code that implements the above steps:

W = 20  # Width of the map
H = 16  # Height of the map

# Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Step 2: Place a b31 block on the base layer (layer 0) at the center slot (y = W/2)
ab_drop('b31', W//2)

# Step 3: Place two b13 blocks on top of the b31 block, aligned with its sides
ab_drop('b13', W//2 - 1)
ab_drop('b13', W//2 + 1)

# Step 4: Place a b31 block on top of the left b13 block, aligned with its top side
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 1)

# Step 5: Place a b31 block on top of the right b13 block, aligned with its top side
ab_drop('b31', W//2 + 1)

# Step 6: Place a b31 block on top of the previous two b31 blocks, aligned with their top sides
ab_drop('b31', W//2)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))

This code will generate a stable structure resembling the character "U" while meeting all the given requirements. The resulting structure will be printed, showing the block arrangements.
