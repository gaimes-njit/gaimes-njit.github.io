To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by placing the two b31 blocks on top of the base to form an "X" shape. This ensures stability and prevents overhangs:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```

3. Place two b13 blocks vertically above the b31 blocks to connect them and maintain stability:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
```

4. Place two b11 blocks on the edges of the "X" shape to complete its structure:
```python
ab_drop("b11", 0)
ab_drop("b11", 19)
```

5. The resulting structure should resemble the character "X" and meet the stability constraints.

Here is the code that generates the structure:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
ab_drop("b11", 0)
ab_drop("b11", 19)

for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "X" and meet all the given constraints.
