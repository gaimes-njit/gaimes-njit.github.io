To generate a structure that resembles the character "Y" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) at the bottom of the structure to form a solid base. This ensures stability. For example:
```python
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop('b11', i)  # Place b11 blocks at the bottom layer
```

3. Place the upper parts of the character "Y" using b31 blocks. Since the b31 blocks need to be on a solid base, we can place them on top of the base blocks. For example:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place a b31 block centered at slot 9
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place a b31 block centered at slot 10
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Place a b31 block centered at slot 11
```

4. Place the center part of the character "Y" using a b13 block. This should be placed on top of the b31 blocks. For example:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Place a b13 block centered at slot 10
```

5. Place the upper part of the character "Y" using b31 blocks. Again, place them on top of the b13 block. For example:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place a b31 block centered at slot 9
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Place a b31 block centered at slot 11
```

6. Finally, print the resulting structure to see the generated character "Y":
```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

By following these steps, we can use the ab_drop() function to generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Y" while meeting all hard constraints. Modify the values in the ab_drop() function as needed to adjust the dropping position and order.
