To create a structure that looks like the letter "D" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into two blocks: a column block and a row block. 

First, we drop the column block (b13) at the bottom-center of the grid. This will create the vertical part of the "D". 

Next, we drop the row block (b31) above the column block. This will create the horizontal part of the "D".

Here is the implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The position of the column block (x_position = 9) is chosen to ensure that the structure is centered horizontally.

Note: This implementation assumes that the initial grid is empty.
