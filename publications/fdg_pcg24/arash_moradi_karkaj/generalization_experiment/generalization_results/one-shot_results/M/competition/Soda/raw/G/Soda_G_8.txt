To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "G", we can break it down into three blocks - a square block for the top part, a column block for the vertical line, and a row block for the horizontal line. We will build the structure from the bottom to the top to ensure stability.

Here is the complete implementation:
```python
# Step 1: Place the square block for the bottom part of the "G"
ab_drop("b11", 8)

# Step 2: Place the column block for the vertical line of the "G"
ab_drop("b13", 8)

# Step 3: Place the row block for the horizontal line of the "G"
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

This implementation will create a structure that resembles the capital letter "G". The blocks are placed in a way that ensures stability, and the resulting structure will be similar to the TARGET character.
