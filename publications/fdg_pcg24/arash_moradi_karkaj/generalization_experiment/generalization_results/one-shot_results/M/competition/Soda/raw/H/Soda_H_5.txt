First, we need to create the top bar for the letter "H". We can do this by dropping a row block ("b31") at the center of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to create the two vertical pipes for the letter "H". We can do this by dropping two column blocks ("b13") at the left and right sides of the grid. We will position them one row above the bottom bar.

```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

Finally, we need to create the bottom bar for the letter "H". We can do this by dropping a row block ("b31") at the center of the grid, one row above the bottom row.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Putting it all together, here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
