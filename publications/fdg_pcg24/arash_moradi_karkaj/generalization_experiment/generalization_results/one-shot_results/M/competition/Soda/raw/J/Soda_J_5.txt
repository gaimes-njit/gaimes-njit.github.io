To generate the structure in the shape of a capital letter "J", we can break it down into three blocks: a top bar, a middle pipe, and a bottom tick. We will build the structure in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability.

1. Place the bottom tick block (b13) at the bottom-left corner of the grid:
```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

2. Place the middle pipe block (b31) on top of the bottom tick, aligned to the center of the grid:
```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

3. Place the top bar block (b13) on top of the middle pipe, aligned to the center of the grid:
```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "J" in the level.
