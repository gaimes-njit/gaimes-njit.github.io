To generate the letter "J" using the ab_drop() function, we can break it down into three blocks: the top bar, the middle pipe, and the bottom tick. Here's the implementation:

```
# Drop the top bar at the center position
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Drop the middle pipe at the center position
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Drop the bottom tick at the center position
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "J" when viewed from the top-down orientation.
