To generate a structure that looks like the letter "L" in the level, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to create the vertical pipe of the "L" shape. We can drop a column block ("b13") at the leftmost position (x_position=0) of the grid. This will occupy cells (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2).

2. Next, we need to create the bottom bar of the "L" shape. We can drop a row block ("b31") at the center position (x_position=9) of the grid. This will occupy cells (7, 1), (8, 1), and (9, 1).

Now, let's combine these steps into the complete implementation:

```python
# Step 1: Create the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 0)

# Step 2: Create the bottom bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation will generate a structure in the level that looks like the letter "L". The blocks will be balanced and well-supported, ensuring stability.
