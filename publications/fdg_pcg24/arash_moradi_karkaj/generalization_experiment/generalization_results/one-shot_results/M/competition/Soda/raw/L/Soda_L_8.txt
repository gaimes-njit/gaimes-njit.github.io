To create a structure that looks like the letter "L" in the Tetris game, we can first place a vertical pipe at the bottom-left corner and then place a horizontal bar at the bottom-right corner. 

Here is the code to achieve this:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 18)
```

Explanation:
- The first line `ab_drop("b31", 1)` drops a block of type "b31" (a vertical pipe) at the x position of 1. This will occupy the cells (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0).
- The second line `ab_drop("b13", 18)` drops a block of type "b13" (a horizontal bar) at the x position of 18. This will occupy the cells (17,0), (18,0), and (19,0).

The resulting structure will look like the letter "L" in the game.

Please note that this code assumes that the level grid is initially empty. If there are any existing blocks in the grid, they may affect the placement of the "L" structure.
