To build the capital letter "M", we can break it down into two column blocks in the middle and two row blocks on the sides. The structure can be built as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 7) # Place the first column block at position 7
ab_drop("b13", 11) # Place the second column block at position 11
ab_drop("b31", 3) # Place the first row block at position 3
ab_drop("b31", 15) # Place the second row block at position 15
```

By following these steps, we successfully create a structure that resembles the capital letter "M" in the Tetris game.
