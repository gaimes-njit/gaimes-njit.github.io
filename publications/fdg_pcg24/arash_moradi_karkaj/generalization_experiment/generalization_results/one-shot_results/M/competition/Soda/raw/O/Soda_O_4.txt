To create a structure that looks like a capital "O" in the Tetris game, we can follow the bottom-to-top approach and start by placing the base blocks first. 

First, let's place the bottom row of the "O" shape using the "b11" block type. We can center it at x_position=9.

Let's drop the block:
```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Next, let's add the two vertical blocks on each side of the bottom row. We can use the "b31" block type.

Let's drop the left vertical block:
```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

Let's drop the right vertical block:
```
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Finally, let's add the top row of the "O" shape using the "b11" block type. We can center it at x_position=9.

Let's drop the block:
```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Now, the complete implementation to generate a structure that looks like the letter "O" is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
