To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "R" in the Tetris game, we can break it down into different blocks and drop them strategically to ensure stability and similarity.

Step 1: Place the base block (bottom horizontal bar)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

Step 2: Place the vertical pillar block (right side of the letter 'R')
ab_drop("b13", 10)

Step 3: Place the middle horizontal bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)

Step 4: Place the top diagonal bar
ab_drop("b13", 8)

Step 5: Place the final horizontal bar (connecting the top diagonal bar with the vertical pillar)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
