To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "T", we can break it down into three blocks: a row block for the horizontal part of the letter, and two column blocks for the vertical part of the letter. 

Here is the complete implementation for generating the "T" shape:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Explanation:
1. The first `ab_drop("b13", 9)` drops a column block at x_position=9, creating the left vertical part of the "T".
2. The second `ab_drop("b31", 9)` drops a row block at x_position=9, creating the horizontal part of the "T".
3. The third `ab_drop("b13", 8)` drops another column block at x_position=8, creating the right vertical part of the "T".

This implementation ensures the stability of the structure by starting from the bottom and building upwards. It also achieves the desired similarity with the "T" shape.

Note: It is assumed that previously defined functions like "ab_drop()" and necessary error handling are already implemented.
