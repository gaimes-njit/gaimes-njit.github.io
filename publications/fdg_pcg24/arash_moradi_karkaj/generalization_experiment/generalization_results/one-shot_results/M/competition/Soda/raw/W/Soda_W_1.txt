To generate the structure that looks like the capital letter "W" (TARGET) in a level, we need to carefully place the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability and similarity.

Here is the step-by-step approach to create the desired structure:

Step 1: Place the base blocks of the "W" shape.
Since the "W" shape has three horizontal bars, we will start by placing the bottom bar first.

ab_drop("b31", 7)

Step 2: Place the two vertical bars of the "W" shape on top of the bottom bar.

ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

Step 3: Place the top bar of the "W" shape.

ab_drop("b31", 7)

Complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

This implementation ensures stability by building the structure from the bottom to the top and placing each block in a balanced and well-supported position. It also creates a structure that closely resembles the capital letter "W" (TARGET).
