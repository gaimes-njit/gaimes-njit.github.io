To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "E", we need to use the ab_drop() function to drop blocks in a specific order and position. We will follow the constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.

Here is the step-by-step process to create the E structure:

1. Define the block types:
   - b11: A 1x1 square block.
   - b31: A 3x1 horizontal block.
   - b13: A 1x3 vertical block.

2. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

3. Drop the b31 horizontal block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and center it at slot 2:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

4. Drop the b31 horizontal block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and center it at slot 8:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ```

5. Drop the b31 horizontal block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and center it at slot 14:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 14)
   ```

6. Drop the b13 vertical block at layer 1 and center it at slot 2:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

7. Drop the b13 vertical block at layer 7 and center it at slot 2:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

8. Drop the b13 vertical block at layer 13 and center it at slot 2:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

9. Drop the b31 horizontal block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and center it at slot 8:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ```

10. Drop the b31 horizontal block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and center it at slot 14:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 14)
   ```

11. Drop the b31 horizontal block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and center it at slot 2:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

By following this sequence of block drops, we can create a stable structure that looks like the character "E" without boundary intrusion.
