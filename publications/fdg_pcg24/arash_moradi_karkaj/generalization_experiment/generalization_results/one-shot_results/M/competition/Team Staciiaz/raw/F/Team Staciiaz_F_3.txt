To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop each block in a specific order and position.

Here is the step-by-step process to generate the structure:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the vertical block b13 at slot 6, aligned to the center of the map.
```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```
This will result in the vertical block occupying slots 5, 6, and 7 in the middle of the map.

Step 3: Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 4, aligned to the bottom of the vertical block.
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
This will result in the horizontal block being placed below the vertical block, occupying slots 3, 4, and 5.

Step 4: Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 4, aligned to the middle of the map.
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
This will result in the second horizontal block being placed in the middle of the map, occupying slots 3, 4, and 5.

Step 5: Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 4, aligned to the top of the vertical block.
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
This will result in the third horizontal block being placed above the vertical block, occupying slots 3, 4, and 5.

Step 6: Drop the square block b11 at slot 7, aligned to the bottom right corner of the structure.
```
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```
This will result in the square block being placed at the bottom right corner of the structure.

The final structure will look like the character "F" and will be stable, meeting all the constraints.

Note: Since the order of dropping blocks is crucial for stability, make sure to follow the specified order in the steps above.
