In order to generate a stable structure that looks like the character "G" and meets all the constraints, we will use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. We will follow the guidelines provided in the block-stacking problem to ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion.

Here is the step-by-step approach to generate the desired structure:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Determine the position and order of dropping the blocks to form the shape of the character "G" by using the `ab_drop()` function. Consider the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints while selecting the slots and layers for each block.

3. Here is a proposed sequence of block drops to form the character "G" within the given constraints:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Drop a 1x1 block at slot 4
   ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Drop a 3x1 block at slot 4
   ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Drop a 1x3 block at slot 4
   ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Drop a 1x1 block at slot 7
   ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Drop a 3x1 block at slot 7
   ab_drop('b13', 10) # Drop a 1x3 block at slot 10
   ```

4. By executing the above sequence of `ab_drop()` function calls, the blocks will be dropped in a stable manner and form a structure that resembles the character "G".

5. Finally, you can visualize the resulting structure by printing the `structure` list:
   ```python
   for row in structure:
       print(' '.join(row))
   ```

The above steps will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "G" and satisfies all the given constraints. Feel free to adjust the block drop positions based on your preferences, as long as the constraints are met.
