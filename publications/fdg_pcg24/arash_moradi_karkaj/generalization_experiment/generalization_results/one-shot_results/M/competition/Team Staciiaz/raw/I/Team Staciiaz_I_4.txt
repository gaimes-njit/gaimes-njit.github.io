To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "I" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in a strategic way. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve the desired structure:

1. Set the initial structure as an empty grid:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop a b31 block at the center slot (position 9) and layer 0 to create a stable base:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 9 and layer 1 to create the vertical part of the "I":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

4. Drop a b13 block at slot 9 and layer 2 to create the horizontal part of the "I":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

5. Continue dropping b13 blocks at slot 9 and increasing layers until the desired height is reached. For example, to create a "I" with a height of 6 layers:
```python
# Next layer: 3
ab_drop('b13', 9)
# Next layer: 4
ab_drop('b13', 9)
# Next layer: 5
ab_drop('b13', 9)
# Next layer: 6
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

This step-by-step approach ensures that the structure is stable and meets the constraints of the block-stacking problem.
