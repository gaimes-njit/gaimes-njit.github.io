To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "J" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is one possible approach:

1. Start by dropping a b11 block at slot 0 and layer 0 to serve as the base of the structure.
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 0)
   ```

2. Drop a b31 block at slot 0 and layer 1 above the base block to create the vertical part of the "J" shape.
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   ```

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 1 and layer 0 to create the horizontal part of the "J" shape.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

4. Drop another b13 block at slot 2 and layer 0 to extend the horizontal part of the "J" shape.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

5. Drop a b11 block at slot 2 and layer 1 to complete the "J" shape.
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 2)
   ```

By following this sequence of block drops, we have created a stable structure that represents the character "J" and satisfies the stability constraint. Additionally, the blocks do not intrude on the boundary of the map, meeting the no boundary intrusion constraint.
