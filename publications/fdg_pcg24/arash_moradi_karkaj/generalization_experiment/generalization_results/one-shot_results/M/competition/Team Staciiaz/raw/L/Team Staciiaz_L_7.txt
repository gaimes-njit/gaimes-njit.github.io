To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here's an approach to achieve that:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. To ensure stability, we need to start by placing the largest block, `b13`, at the bottom left corner (slot 0) of the structure. We can achieve this by calling `ab_drop('b13', 0)`.

3. Next, we can place the `b11` block on top of the `b13` block, centered at slot 1. This can be done by calling `ab_drop('b11', 1)`.

4. Now, we need to add the final block, `b31`, on top of the `b11` block. However, we need to determine the slot that will make the structure stable. To do this, we can iterate through the available slots and check the stability of the structure after dropping the `b31` block at each slot. We can use the `get_highest_empty_y_position()` function to determine the highest empty Y position for each slot.

5. We can start from slot 0 and check the stability at each slot until we find a stable position. We can use a loop like this:
```python
slot = 0
while True:
    highest_empty_height = get_highest_empty_y_position(slot)
    # Calculate stability based on rules specific to block stacking problem
    is_stable = check_stability(structure, highest_empty_height, slot, 'b31')
    if is_stable:
        ab_drop('b31', slot)
        break
    slot += 1
```
In the `check_stability()` function, we can consider factors like weight distribution, overhang limits, and stability rules specific to the block stacking problem to determine stability.

6. After dropping the `b31` block, the structure should resemble the character "L" and meet the stability constraint.

7. To ensure no boundary intrusion, we need to check if any part of the structure goes beyond the boundary of the map. We can add boundary checks within the `ab_drop()` function to prevent block placement that violates the boundary.

By following this approach and using the `ab_drop()` function strategically, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L" and meets all the constraints.
