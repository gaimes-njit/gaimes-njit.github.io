To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "M" and satisfies all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function and a series of drop operations.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first vertical block 'b13' in the middle of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

3. Drop a horizontal block 'b31' on top of the vertical block, centered at slot 9:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

4. Drop a second vertical block 'b13' on top of the horizontal block, centered at slot 5:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

5. Drop a horizontal block 'b31' on top of the second vertical block, centered at slot 9:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

6. Drop the final vertical block 'b13' on top of the last horizontal block, centered at slot 13:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 13)
```

The above steps create a stable structure that resembles the character "M" within the given constraints. Each block is dropped in a way that ensures stability and the structure does not intrude on the boundaries of the map.

Note: The exact slot positions may vary depending on the implementation of the `ab_drop()` function and the specific block sizes and positions used.
