To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "P" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop blocks in a way that ensures stability and avoids boundary intrusion.

Here is a possible approach to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the bottom horizontal block (`b31`) at slot 0:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Drop the vertical block (`b13`) at slot 0 on top of the horizontal block, aligning the center of the vertical block with the center of the horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Drop the top horizontal block (`b31`) at slot 2 on top of the vertical block, aligning the center of the top horizontal block with the center of the vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This sequence of block drops will result in a stable structure that looks like the character "P" and satisfies the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Please note that this is just one possible solution and there might be multiple ways to achieve the desired structure. The key is to strategically drop the blocks in a way that ensures stability and avoids boundary intrusion.
