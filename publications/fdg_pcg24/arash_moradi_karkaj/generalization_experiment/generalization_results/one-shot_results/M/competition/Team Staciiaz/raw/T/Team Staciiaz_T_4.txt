To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "T" and meets all the constraints, we will use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here's the approach we can follow:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code snippet.
2. Drop three blocks of type `b31` vertically from the top, aligning their centers with slots 9, 10, and 11. This forms the horizontal top part of the "T" character.
3. Drop a block of type `b13` vertically from the top, aligning its center with slot 10. This forms the vertical stem of the "T" character.
4. Verify if the structure meets the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. If not, adjust the drop positions and order as needed to ensure stability and minimize boundary intrusion.

Here's the code implementation:

```python
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]  # Initialize empty structure

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    """Drop a block at `x_position` which are integers"""
    """There are three block types: 'b11' is 1x1 unit block, 'b31' is a 3x1 unit block, and 'b13' is a 1x3 unit block"""

    def get_highest_empty_y_position(x):
        for y in range(H - 1, -1, -1):
            if structure[y][x] == ' ':
                return y
        return -1

    block_shapes = {
        'b11': [(0, 0)],
        'b31': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)],
        'b13': [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (-2, 0)]
    }

    if x_position < 0 or x_position >= W:
        print("Invalid x_position")
        return

    if block_type not in block_shapes:
        print("Invalid block type")
        return

    highest_empty_height = get_highest_empty_y_position(x_position)

    for dx, dy in block_shapes[block_type]:
        y = highest_empty_height + dy
        if y < 0 or y >= H:
            print(f"Invalid x_position for block type '{block_type}'")
            return
        structure[y][x_position + dx] = 'x'


# Drop top blocks to form horizontal part of "T"
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop at slot 9
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Drop at slot 10
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Drop at slot 11

# Drop vertical block to form stem of "T"
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Drop at slot 10

# Verify stability and boundary intrusion constraints
# Adjust drop positions and order if needed

# Print resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

By following this approach and making any necessary adjustments to the drop positions and order, the generated structure should meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints while resembling the character "T".
