To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "V" and meets all the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a strategic manner.

First, we need to define the criteria for stability. In this case, we can consider a structure stable if all the blocks have a stable base beneath them. To achieve this, we should drop the blocks in a way that ensures the lower blocks have a solid foundation.

To satisfy the constraint of no boundary intrusion, we should aim to keep the blocks within the map's bounds. We can adjust the drop positions of the blocks to avoid any intrusion into the boundary regions.

Here's an example approach to generate a stable "V" structure:

1. Start by dropping a block of type 'b11' at the center slot (position 9) of the bottom layer (layer 0) using `ab_drop('b11', 9)`.
2. Drop a block of type 'b11' at slots 8 and 10 of the next layer (layer 1).
3. Drop a block of type 'b31' at slots 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the third layer (layer 2). This forms the lower part of the "V" structure.
4. Drop a block of type 'b11' at slots 7 and 11 of the fourth layer (layer 3).
5. Drop a block of type 'b31' at slots 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 of the fifth layer (layer 4). This forms the middle part of the "V" structure.
6. Drop a block of type 'b11' at slots 6 and 12 of the sixth layer (layer 5).
7. Drop a block of type 'b31' at slots 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 of the seventh layer (layer 6). This forms the upper part of the "V" structure.
8. Drop a block of type 'b13' at slot 6 of the eighth layer (layer 7).
9. Drop a block of type 'b13' at slot 6 of the ninth layer (layer 8).
10. Drop a block of type 'b13' at slot 6 of the tenth layer (layer 9).
11. Drop a block of type 'b13' at slot 7 of the eleventh layer (layer 10).
12. Drop a block of type 'b13' at slot 5 of the twelfth layer (layer 11).
13. Drop a block of type 'b13' at slot 7 of the thirteenth layer (layer 12).
14. Drop a block of type 'b13' at slot 5 of the fourteenth layer (layer 13).
15. Drop a block of type 'b13' at slot 8 of the fifteenth layer (layer 14).
16. Drop a block of type 'b13' at slot 4 of the sixteenth layer (layer 15).

After following these steps, the structure should resemble the character "V" and meet all the given constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.

Note that this is just one possible approach, and different drop positions or block types can be used to achieve the same goal. The key is to ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion while dropping the blocks.
