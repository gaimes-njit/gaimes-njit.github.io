To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "V" and meets all the given constraints, we can utilize the `ab_drop()` function to iteratively drop blocks in a strategic manner.

First, we need to determine the dropping positions for each block type to form the "V" shape. Since the dropping positions and order are crucial, we'll need to carefully choose the positions to ensure stability. Here's the plan:

1. Drop a b31 block at slots 4-6 (inclusive) to form the bottom part of the "V" shape.
2. Drop a b13 block at slot 5 to connect the two sides of the "V" shape.
3. Drop a b31 block at slots 9-11 (inclusive) to form the top part of the "V" shape.

Here's how we can implement the plan using the `ab_drop()` function:

```python
# Step 1
for slot in range(4, 7):
    ab_drop('b31', slot)

# Step 2
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Step 3
for slot in range(9, 12):
    ab_drop('b31', slot)
```

By following this plan, we ensure that the blocks are dropped in a stable manner, and we avoid boundary intrusion.

After executing the above code, the `structure` variable will hold the stable structure that resembles the character "V" and meets all the given constraints.
