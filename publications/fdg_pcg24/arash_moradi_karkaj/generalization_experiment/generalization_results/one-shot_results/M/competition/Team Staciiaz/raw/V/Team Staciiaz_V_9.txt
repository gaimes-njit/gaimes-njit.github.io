To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "V" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the base block (`b31`) at the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Drop the left side of the "V" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

4. Drop the right side of the "V" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b13', 13)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "V" and meet the stability constraint. To avoid boundary intrusion, we have ensured that the blocks are placed within the slots 1 to 18, leaving the boundary slots empty.

Keep in mind that the `ab_drop()` function will handle the actual block placement and ensure that the blocks are dropped in a stable manner. The provided code snippet only shows the sequence of block types and slot positions to achieve the desired structure.
