To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop the blocks in a way that satisfies the stability constraint and avoids boundary intrusion.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Start by dropping a `b31` block at slot 8 to form the middle part of the "W". This block should be dropped with its center aligned at slot 8 using the `ab_drop('b31', 8)` function.

2. Drop another `b31` block at slot 4 and a `b11` block at slot 2 to form the left part of the "W". These blocks should be dropped in a way that they are stable and do not intrude on the boundary. Again, use the `ab_drop()` function to drop these blocks.

3. Finally, drop a `b31` block at slot 12 and a `b11` block at slot 14 to form the right part of the "W". Ensure that these blocks are also stable and do not intrude on the boundary.

By following this approach, you can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" and meets all the given constraints.
