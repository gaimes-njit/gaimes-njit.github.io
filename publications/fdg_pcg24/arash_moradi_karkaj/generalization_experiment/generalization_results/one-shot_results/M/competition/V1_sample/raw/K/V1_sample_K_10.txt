Using the ‘ab drop()’ function, we can create a stable structure in the shape of a "K" as follows:

1. Start by dropping a b13 block at layer 15 with its center at slot 9 (y = 9).

2. Next, drop a b31 block at layer 14 with its center at slot 9 (y = 9).

3. Then, drop another b13 block at layer 13 with its center at slot 9 (y = 9).

4. Finally, drop a b11 block at layer 13 with its center at slot 8 (y = 8).

By following this sequence and positioning, the blocks will stack on top of each other to form a stable "K" structure.
