To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A" using the `ab_drop()` function, we will need to follow a step-by-step process. Here is the algorithm to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` variable:
   `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`

2. Drop the first block, which is a b13 block, at the center slot (y = W/2) by calling `ab_drop('b13', W//2)`.
   - Check if the structure is stable after the drop.
   - Record the coordinates of the dropped block.

3. Drop the second block, which is another b13 block, directly above the first block at the same slot.
   - Check if the structure is stable after the drop.
   - Record the coordinates of the dropped block.

4. Drop the third block, which is a b31 block, on top of the two previous blocks.
   - The center of the block should align with the center of the first two blocks.
   - Check if the structure is stable after the drop.
   - Record the coordinates of the dropped block.

5. Drop the fourth block, which is a b11 block, on top of the middle slot of the third block.
   - Check if the structure is stable after the drop.
   - Record the coordinates of the dropped block.

6. Drop the fifth block, which is another b11 block, directly above the fourth block at the same slot.
   - Check if the structure is stable after the drop.
   - Record the coordinates of the dropped block.

7. Drop the sixth block, which is a b31 block, on top of the middle slot of the fifth block.
   - Check if the structure is stable after the drop.
   - Record the coordinates of the dropped block.

8. Finally, check if the resulting structure resembles the uppercase letter "A" by comparing the shape of the structure with a predefined pattern for the letter "A".

9. If the structure does not resemble the letter "A", repeat steps 2 to 8 with different combinations of blocks until a suitable structure is generated.

Remember to always check for stability after each drop and ensure that the structure adheres to the given constraints. The `ab_drop()` function should be called multiple times in the process, and the coordinates of each drop should be recorded. The "y" coordinate in `ab_drop()` should be an accurate coordinate instead of a formula with W, as stated in constraint 5.8.
