To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "B", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the center slot 9 of layer 0:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

3. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block at the slots 8 to 10 of layer 1:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

4. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block at the slots 8 to 10 of layer 2:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

5. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous block at the slots 8 to 10 of layer 3:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

6. Drop a b13 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 4:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

7. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 5:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 9)
   ```

8. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 6:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 9)
   ```

9. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 7:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 9)
   ```

10. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 8:
    ```
    ab_drop('b11', 9)
    ```

11. Drop a b13 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 9:
    ```
    ab_drop('b13', 9)
    ```

12. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 10:
    ```
    ab_drop('b11', 9)
    ```

13. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 11:
    ```
    ab_drop('b11', 9)
    ```

14. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 12:
    ```
    ab_drop('b11', 9)
    ```

15. Drop a b13 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 13:
    ```
    ab_drop('b13', 9)
    ```

16. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 14:
    ```
    ab_drop('b11', 9)
    ```

17. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous block at slot 9 of layer 15:
    ```
    ab_drop('b11', 9)
    ```

By following these steps, the generated structure should resemble the uppercase character "B". The blocks will be dropped in a stable manner, ensuring a balanced weight distribution.
