To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "F" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
2. Determine the positions to drop each block in order to create the desired structure.
3. Perform stability checks before each call to `ab_drop()` to ensure the structure remains stable.
4. Place the blocks on the structure using the `ab_drop()` function.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the entire structure is built.

Here is an example implementation of the algorithm:

```python
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Define the positions to drop each block
b31_positions = [(2, 4), (2, 9)]
b13_positions = [(3, 5)]
b11_positions = [(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6)]

# Function to check stability of the structure
def is_stable(position):
    x, y = position
    if x == 0:
        return True
    if structure[x-1][y] != ' ':
        return True
    if x >= 2 and structure[x-2][y] != ' ':
        return True
    return False

# Function to drop a block on the structure
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Initialize drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # Move the block down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # Place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Perform stability checks and drop the blocks in the desired positions
for position in b31_positions:
    if is_stable(position):
        ab_drop('b31', position[1])
for position in b13_positions:
    if is_stable(position):
        ab_drop('b13', position[1])
for position in b11_positions:
    if is_stable(position):
        ab_drop('b11', position[1])

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This algorithm ensures that the structure is stable at each step by performing stability checks before dropping each block. It also places the blocks in the desired positions to create a structure that looks like the uppercase character "F".
