To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "R" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the following approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block on layer 0 at the center slot (y = W//2).
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', W//2)
   ```

3. Drop a b13 block on the layer above the b31 block, aligned with the right edge of the b31 block.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', W//2 + 1)
   ```

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 three more times, increasing the layer by 1 and aligning the b13 block with the right edge of the previous b13 block.
   ```python
   for i in range(3):
       ab_drop('b31', W//2)
       ab_drop('b13', W//2 + 1 + i*2)
   ```

5. Drop a b11 block on the layer above the top b13 block, aligned with the left edge of the b31 block.
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', W//2 - 1)
   ```

6. Determine the stability of the structure after each drop by checking if the blocks are properly supported. If a block has a block directly below and the slots on both sides are empty, it is considered stable. Check the stability of the structure after each drop and ensure that the structure is stable before generating the next block.

7. Repeat steps 2-6 with different starting slots and order of block drops to generate diverse structures.

When implementing this approach, make sure to check stability and meet the other hard constraints, such as not intruding on the map boundary and ensuring the overall shape resembles the uppercase letter "R".
