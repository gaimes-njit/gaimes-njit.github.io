To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "S", we can follow the given constraints and use the `ab_drop()` function. Here is an outline of the steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Begin by dropping the b13 block at the bottom center of the structure to act as the base for the "S" shape:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', W//2)
   ```

3. Drop the b31 block on top of the base, slightly shifted to the right:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', (W//2) + 1)
   ```

4. Drop the b31 block on top of the previous block, slightly shifted to the left:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', (W//2) - 1)
   ```

5. Drop the b31 block on top of the previous block, slightly shifted to the right:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', (W//2) + 1)
   ```

6. Drop the b31 block on top of the previous block, slightly shifted to the left:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', (W//2) - 1)
   ```

7. Drop the b13 block on top of the previous blocks, at the top left corner:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

8. Drop the b31 block on top of the previous block, slightly shifted to the right:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

9. Drop the b31 block on top of the previous block, slightly shifted to the right:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

10. Drop the b13 block on top of the previous blocks, at the top right corner:
    ```
    ab_drop('b13', W-1)
    ```

By following these steps and calling the `ab_drop()` function with the appropriate block types and slot numbers, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "S" and meets all the hard constraints.
