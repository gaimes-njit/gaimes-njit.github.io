To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "X" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the b31 block at the center slot, aligned with the bottom (layer 0) to serve as the base of the structure. This will ensure stability.
```
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

3. Next, drop the b13 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with the center slot to create the diagonal line of the "X" shape. This will add stability to the structure.
```
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

4. Now, drop the b11 block on the left side of the b13 block, aligned with the center slot. This will complete the left arm of the "X" shape.
```
ab_drop('b11', W//2-1)
```

5. Repeat step 4 for the right side of the b13 block, aligned with the center slot. This will complete the right arm of the "X" shape.
```
ab_drop('b11', W//2+1)
```

6. Finally, drop two b11 blocks on top of the b13 block to complete the top section of the "X" shape. Align them with the same slot used for the b11 blocks in steps 4 and 5.
```
ab_drop('b11', W//2-1)
ab_drop('b11', W//2+1)
```

After executing these steps, the structure will resemble the uppercase character "X" and meet all the hard constraints.
