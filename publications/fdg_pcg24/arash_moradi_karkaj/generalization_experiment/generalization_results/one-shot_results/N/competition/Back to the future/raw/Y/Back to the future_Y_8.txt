To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Y", we need to carefully drop the blocks in a specific order and position while satisfying the hard constraints. Here is an example of how the `ab_drop()` function can be used to achieve this:

1. Drop the first b11 block at position (9, 9), which is the center slot. This block forms the top part of the "Y" shape.

2. Drop the second b11 block at position (10, 9). This block forms the vertical part of the "Y" shape.

3. Drop the third b11 block at position (11, 9). This block forms the bottom part of the "Y" shape.

4. Drop the b13 block at position (13, 9). This block forms the diagonal part of the "Y" shape.

5. Drop the b31 block at position (14, 7). This block supports the b13 block and ensures stability.

6. Drop another b31 block at position (14, 11). This block also supports the b13 block and ensures stability.

7. Drop the remaining b31 block at position (15, 9). This block completes the base of the "Y" shape.

By following this order and position for dropping the blocks, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Y" and meets all the hard constraints.
