To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Y" and meets all the given hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function provided. We will follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given map initialization code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b13 block in the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

3. Drop the b31 blocks on the left and right sides:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 1)
ab_drop('b31', W//2 + 1)
```

4. Drop the b11 blocks above the b31 blocks to complete the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b11', W//2 - 1)
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
ab_drop('b11', W//2 + 1)
```

5. The final structure will resemble the uppercase character "Y" and will meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is the complete code for generating the structure:
```python
W = 20
H = 16

def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    return drop_pos

# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the b13 block in the center slot
ab_drop('b13', W//2)

# Drop the b31 blocks on the left and right sides
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 1)
ab_drop('b31', W//2 + 1)

# Drop the b11 blocks above the b31 blocks
ab_drop('b11', W//2 - 1)
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the uppercase character "Y" and will be stable according to the given hard constraints.
