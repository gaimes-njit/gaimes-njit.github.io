To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Z" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the provided `ab_drop()` function and follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping positions and order for each block type to create the "Z" shape. Start from the bottom and work your way up.

2.1. Drop the b13 block at the bottom layer, at the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
Coordinates: (15, 9)

2.2. Drop the b31 block above the b13 block, offset to the left:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```
Coordinates: (12, 5)

2.3. Drop the b11 block above the b31 block, aligned with the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
Coordinates: (9, 5)

2.4. Drop the b31 block above the b11 block, offset to the right:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
Coordinates: (6, 9)

2.5. Drop the b13 block above the b31 block, aligned with the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
Coordinates: (3, 9)

3. Check the stability and adjust if needed before dropping the next block.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire structure resembles the uppercase character "Z". For example, to generate a stable structure that resembles the uppercase letter "Z", you can follow these steps for each block:

4.1. Determine the dropping position and order for the block type.

4.2. Drop the block using the `ab_drop()` function.

4.3. Check the stability and adjust if needed before dropping the next block.

5. Once the entire structure is generated, the final result should resemble the uppercase character "Z" and meet all the hard constraints.

Note: The specific dropping positions and order may vary to ensure stability and to create a diverse structure, as described in constraint 5.6.
