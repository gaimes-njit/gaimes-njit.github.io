To generate the shape resembling the letter "H" using the given function ab_drop(x, y), we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the field:
   - Create a 2D matrix list with dimensions 16 rows and 20 columns, representing the field.
   - Each cell should be initialized as empty (0).

2. Generate the vertical parts of the "H":
   - Use ab_drop('b13', x) to generate the left vertical part:
     - Start with x = 7 to ensure a stable structure.
     - This will occupy cells (7, 0), (7, 1), and (7, 2).
   - Use ab_drop('b13', x) again to generate the right vertical part:
     - Start with x = 11 to ensure a stable structure.
     - This will occupy cells (11, 0), (11, 1), and (11, 2).

3. Generate the horizontal part of the "H":
   - Use ab_drop('b31', x) to generate the horizontal part:
     - Start with x = 8 to ensure a stable structure.
     - This will occupy cells (7, 3), (8, 3), and (9, 3).

The code for generating the shape resembling the letter "H" would look like this:

```python
# 1. Initialize the field
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# 2. Generate the vertical parts of the "H"
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 11)

# 3. Generate the horizontal part of the "H"
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

Make sure to execute the code above to visualize the final structure resembling the letter "H" on the field that meets the stability and boundary collision requirements.
