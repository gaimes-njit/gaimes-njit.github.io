To form the shape resembling the letter "N" with the available bricks, we can proceed as follows:

1. Initialize the field:
   - Create a 2D matrix of size 20x16 to represent the field.
   - Initialize all cells in the matrix to be empty.

2. Place the first brick (b13):
   - Execute the function ab_drop('b13', 3) to place the b13 brick in the desired position.
   - This will occupy cells (3, 0), (3, 1), and (3, 2) on the field.

3. Place the second brick (b31):
   - Execute the function ab_drop('b31', 6) to place the b31 brick on top of the first brick.
   - This will occupy cells (3, 3), (4, 3), and (5, 3) on the field.

4. Place the third brick (b11):
   - Execute the function ab_drop('b11', 7) to place the b11 brick on top of the second brick.
   - This will occupy cell (4, 6) on the field.

5. Check stability:
   - Check the stability of the bricks. In this case, the bricks are stable because the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot (cell (4, 6)) is the same.

6. Avoid boundary collisions:
   - Check if any of the occupied cells of the bricks exceed the boundaries of the field. In this case, all occupied cells are within the field boundaries.

7. Final structure:
   - The final structure resembles the letter "N" with the bricks occupying the following cells:
     - (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)
     - (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)
     - (4, 6)

Note: The code to execute the ab_drop() function should be written separately from the analysis, in the code block below the analysis section, between the last 2 pairs of three backticks (`).
