To generate the shape resembling the letter "R" using the available props and the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the field by creating a 20x16 grid of cells.

```
field = [[' ' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Place the 'b31' brick horizontally at the bottom-left of the field to form the base of the letter "R". Use the ab_drop() function to drop the brick on the ground with an x_position of 0.

```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Place the 'b13' brick vertically on the right side of the 'b31' brick to form the vertical line of the letter "R". Use the ab_drop() function to drop the brick with an x_position of 3.

```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

4. Place the 'b11' brick to form the diagonal line of the letter "R". The brick needs to be positioned diagonally above the right side of the 'b13' brick. To achieve this, we can use the ab_drop() function twice, first with an x_position of 4, and then with an x_position of 5.

```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

5. Ensure stability by checking the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot of the upper brick. In this case, the pivot is the cell (5, 1) occupied by the upper 'b11' brick. Since the left side has one occupied cell and the right side has zero occupied cells, the structure is stable.

6. To avoid boundary collisions, make sure that the occupied cells of the bricks do not exceed the boundaries of the field. Since the shape "R" is positioned towards the bottom-left of the field, the occupied cells should not go beyond the y-axis = 0 or x-axis = 19.

With these steps, we can generate the shape resembling the letter "R" on the specified field while satisfying the important notes of stability and avoiding boundary collisions.
