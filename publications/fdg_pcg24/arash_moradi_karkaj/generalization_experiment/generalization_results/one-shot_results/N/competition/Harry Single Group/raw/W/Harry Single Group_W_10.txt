To create a structure resembling the letter "W" using the available props, we can break it down into three parts: the two outer branches and the middle section. 

First, let's generate the two outer branches of the "W". We can start by placing a b31 brick horizontally at the bottom of the field, slightly offset from the left edge. We'll use an x_position of 2 for the first branch and 14 for the second branch. 

Next, we'll place a b13 brick vertically on top of each b31 brick. We'll use an x_position of 2 for the first branch and 14 for the second branch. 

Finally, we'll place a b13 brick vertically in the middle of the field, between the two branches. We'll use an x_position of 8 for the middle section.

Here's the code to generate the structure:

```python
# Map initialization
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check if a cell is occupied
def is_occupied(x, y):
    if field[y][x] == 1:
        return True
    return False

# Function to update the field with a brick
def update_field(x, y, brick):
    if brick == 'b31':
        field[y][x-1] = 1
        field[y][x] = 1
        field[y][x+1] = 1
    elif brick == 'b13':
        field[y-2][x] = 1
        field[y-1][x] = 1
        field[y][x] = 1
    elif brick == 'b11':
        field[y][x] = 1

# Function to drop a brick and update the field
def ab_drop(brick, x_position):
    if brick == 'b31':
        y = 15
        while not (is_occupied(x_position-1, y) or is_occupied(x_position, y) or is_occupied(x_position+1, y)):
            y -= 1
            if y < 0:
                y = 0
                break
        update_field(x_position, y, 'b31')
    elif brick == 'b13':
        y = 15
        while not (is_occupied(x_position, y-2) or is_occupied(x_position, y-1) or is_occupied(x_position, y)):
            y -= 1
            if y < 0:
                y = 0
                break
        update_field(x_position, y, 'b13')
    elif brick == 'b11':
        y = 15
        while not is_occupied(x_position, y):
            y -= 1
            if y < 0:
                y = 0
                break
        update_field(x_position, y, 'b11')

# Generate the "W" structure
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

After executing this code, the field will be updated with the occupied cells representing the structure resembling the letter "W".
