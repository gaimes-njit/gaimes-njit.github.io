To form the letter "X" shape using the provided bricks and functions, we can analyze the structure and come up with a solution. Here's an example solution using the ab_drop() function:

```
# Step 1: Map initialization
map = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Step 2: Generating the structure

# Generating first diagonal line
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Placing b13 brick at x_position = 0
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Placing b31 brick at x_position = 4

# Generating second diagonal line
ab_drop('b13', 15)  # Placing b13 brick at x_position = 15
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Placing b31 brick at x_position = 11

# Step 3: Checking stability and avoiding boundary collisions
# The already implemented ab_drop() function takes care of stability and boundary collisions automatically.
# Therefore, we don't need additional checks in this case.

# Output the final map
for row in map:
    print(row)
```

The code above initializes a map with the dimensions specified. Then, using the ab_drop() function, it places the required bricks to form an "X" shape. The function takes care of stability and boundary collisions automatically. Finally, the code outputs the final map with the bricks in place.
