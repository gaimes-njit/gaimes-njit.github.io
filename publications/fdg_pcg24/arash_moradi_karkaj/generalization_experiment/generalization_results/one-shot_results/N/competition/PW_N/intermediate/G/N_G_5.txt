To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we need to use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b13',2)  // Place a vertical straight block at position 2 along the width.
ab_drop('b13',3)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 3 along the width.
top                // This command stabilizes the blocks and prevents them from falling.
ab_drop('b13',4)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 4 along the width.
ab_drop('b13',5)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 5 along the width.
ab_drop('b13',6)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 6 along the width.
side               // This command stabilizes the blocks and prevents them from falling.
ab_drop('b31',3)  // Place a horizontal straight block starting from position 3 along the width, spanning 3 units.
ab_drop('b11',5)  // Place a 1x1 square block at position 5 along the width.

The final result should resemble the uppercase English letter "G" within the defined grid boundaries.
