Explanation:
To create the letter "G", we need to carefully stack the blocks in a specific order to form the desired shape. 

1) Start by placing a vertical straight block ('b13') at position (1,1) to form the vertical line of the letter.
2) Place another vertical straight block ('b13') at position (2,1) to extend the vertical line.
3) Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position (3,1) to create the top line of the letter.
4) Continue by placing another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position (2,1) to extend the top line.
5) Finally, place two 1x1 square blocks ('b11') at positions (1,2) and (2,2) to complete the letter "G".

Make sure to follow the correct order and positions to achieve the desired result.
