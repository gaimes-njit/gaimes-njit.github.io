To generate the uppercase letter "H", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',4)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',5)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13',6)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b13',8)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 8

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries and adhere to the gravity rules.
