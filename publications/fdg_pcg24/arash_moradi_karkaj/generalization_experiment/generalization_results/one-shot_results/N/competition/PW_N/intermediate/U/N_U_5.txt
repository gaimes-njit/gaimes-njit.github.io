To generate the uppercase letter "U," you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1 along the width
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1 along the width
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 3 along the width
ab_drop('b31',5)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 5 along the width
ab_drop('b13',5)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 5 along the width
ab_drop('b31',7)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 7 along the width
ab_drop('b13',7)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 7 along the width
ab_drop('b31',9)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 9 along the width
ab_drop('b13',9)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 9 along the width
ab_drop('b31',11) # Place another horizontal straight block at position 11 along the width
ab_drop('b13',11) # Place another vertical straight block at position 11 along the width
ab_drop('b31',13) # Place another horizontal straight block at position 13 along the width
ab_drop('b13',13) # Place another vertical straight block at position 13 along the width
ab_drop('b31',15) # Place another horizontal straight block at position 15 along the width
ab_drop('b13',15) # Place another vertical straight block at position 15 along the width
ab_drop('b31',17) # Place another horizontal straight block at position 17 along the width
ab_drop('b13',17) # Place another vertical straight block at position 17 along the width
ab_drop('b31',19) # Place another horizontal straight block at position 19 along the width

This stream of commands will generate the letter "U" using the block types and the defined environment.
