To generate the letter "V", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 5

This set of commands will create the letter "V" by stacking the blocks in the specified positions.
