Your task is to create uppercase English letter "X" using the given block types and the ab_drop() command. The specific commands required to construct the letter "X" are as follows:

ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 along the width
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 along the width
top                # Drops the blocks until they reach the top boundary
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 along the width
side               # Drops the block until it reaches the stack beneath
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 along the width
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place a square block (b11) at position 5 along the width
