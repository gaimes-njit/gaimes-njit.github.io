To generate the letter "A" using the mentioned command and Block Types, you can follow the steps below:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 2 and 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 along the width (on top of the two vertical blocks):
```
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 along the width (to the right of the horizontal block):
```
ab_drop('b13',5)
```

4. Finally, place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 5 along the width (above the vertical block):
```
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

These commands will create a stable structure resembling the uppercase letter "A" within the defined environment.
