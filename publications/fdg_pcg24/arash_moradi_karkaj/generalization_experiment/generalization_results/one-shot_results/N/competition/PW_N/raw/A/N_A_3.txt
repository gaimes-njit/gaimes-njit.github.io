To generate the uppercase English letter "A" using the given block types and environment, the following sequence of ab_drop() commands should be used:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 4

This sequence of commands will create a letter "A" in the Tetris-like environment while maintaining structural stability and adherence to the gravity rules.
