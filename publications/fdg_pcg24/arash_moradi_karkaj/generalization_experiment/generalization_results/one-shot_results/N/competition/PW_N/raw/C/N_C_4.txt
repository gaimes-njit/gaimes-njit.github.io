To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can use a combination of block types in the given environment. Here is a stream of commands using the ab_drop() function to construct the letter "C":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position (1,1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place a vertical straight block at position (2,1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place a vertical straight block at position (3,1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position (3,3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place a square block at position (2,3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place a square block at position (3,3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place a square block at position (4,3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position (4,6)
ab_drop('b13', 5)   # Place a vertical straight block at position (5,6)
ab_drop('b13', 6)   # Place a vertical straight block at position (6,6)
```

By executing these commands in the given environment, the blocks will be placed in such a way that they resemble the uppercase English letter "C" while ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
