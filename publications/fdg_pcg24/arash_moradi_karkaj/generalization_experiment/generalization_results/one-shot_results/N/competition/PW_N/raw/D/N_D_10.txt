To create the uppercase letter "D" using the given Block Types, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 2 and 3 along the width:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 along the width, on top of the two vertical blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 along the width, next to the previous blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

4. Finally, place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 5 along the width, on top of the vertical block:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "D" would be:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
