To generate the uppercase English letter "E", we can use the following set of commands:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Adds the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Adds the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Adds the vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Adds the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Adds the square block at position 4

These commands will create the shape of the letter "E" within the defined boundaries and with the required stability.
