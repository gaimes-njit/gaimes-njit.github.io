To generate the letter "E" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the first vertical straight block at position X=2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position X=3
top                # Move to the top of the current stack
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position X=3
side               # Move to the side of the current stack
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the third vertical straight block at position X=5
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place the square block at position X=5
```

These commands will create a stack of blocks in the shape of the letter "E" within the boundaries of the allowed space.
