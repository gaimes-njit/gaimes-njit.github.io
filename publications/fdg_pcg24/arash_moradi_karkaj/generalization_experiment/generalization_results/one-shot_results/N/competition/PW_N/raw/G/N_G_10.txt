To generate the capital English letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 on the grid:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place another vertical straight block (b13) right next to it at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Move to the top of the letter and place a horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 3:
```
top
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

4. Move to the side of the letter and place a vertical straight block (b13) starting from position 5:
```
side
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

5. Finally, complete the shape of the letter by placing a 1x1 square block (b11) right next to the previous block at position 5:
```
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase English letter "G" in the given environment.
