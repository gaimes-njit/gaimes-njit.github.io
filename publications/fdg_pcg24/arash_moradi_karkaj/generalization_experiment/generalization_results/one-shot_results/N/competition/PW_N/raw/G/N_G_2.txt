To generate the uppercase English letter "G", you can use the following commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
top
ab_drop('b31',3)
side
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

These commands will construct the letter "G" by stacking and placing the block types in the defined environment.
