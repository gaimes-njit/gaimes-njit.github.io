To generate the uppercase letter "H", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 5
```

This stream of commands will create the letter "H" using the specified block types. Make sure to follow the gravity rules and avoid exceeding the height boundary.
