To generate the uppercase English letter "H" using the given block types and environment, here is the stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)  // Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 4)  // Place a vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7)  // Place a horizontal straight block at position 7
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "H" within the allowed space while following the gravity rules.
