To generate the uppercase English letter "I", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1) ab_drop('b13',2) ab_drop('b13',3) ab_drop('b31',4)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "I" starting from the leftmost position (X=1) and using the block types b31 and b13.
