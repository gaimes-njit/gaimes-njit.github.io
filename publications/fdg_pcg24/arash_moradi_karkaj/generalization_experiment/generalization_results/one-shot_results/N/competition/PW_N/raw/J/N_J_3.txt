To generate the uppercase English letter "J", you can use the following stream of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

This sequence of commands will create the shape of the letter "J" within the allowed space and following the gravity rules.
