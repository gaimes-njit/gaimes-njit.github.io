To generate the uppercase English letter "J", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b13',6)
```

This sequence of commands will create a letter "J" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
