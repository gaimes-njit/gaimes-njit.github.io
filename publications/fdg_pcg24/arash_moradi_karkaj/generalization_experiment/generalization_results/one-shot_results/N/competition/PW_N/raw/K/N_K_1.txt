To generate the uppercase letter "K" using the given block types, we can manually place the blocks in the following pattern:

1. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 and position 3.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3.
3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 5.
4. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 5.

To summarize, the stream of commands to generate the letter "K" would be:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
