To create the uppercase letter "L", you can use the following stream of commands:

``` 
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b11',4)
```

Explanation:

1. `ab_drop('b13',1)` - This command places a vertical straight block of width 1 unit and height 3 units at position 1 along the width.
2. `ab_drop('b13',2)` - This command places another vertical straight block of width 1 unit and height 3 units at position 2. This block will stack on top of the previous one.
3. `ab_drop('b31',2)` - This command places a horizontal straight block of width 3 units and height 1 unit at position 2. This block connects the two vertical blocks and forms the base of the "L" shape.
4. `ab_drop('b13',4)` - This command places another vertical straight block of width 1 unit and height 3 units at position 4. This block will be placed on top of the horizontal block and forms the upright part of the "L" shape.
5. `ab_drop('b11',4)` - This command places a square block of width 1 unit and height 1 unit at position 4. This block is placed on top of the previous vertical block and completes the "L" shape.

By executing the above commands in order, you will stack the blocks in a way that resembles the uppercase letter "L".
