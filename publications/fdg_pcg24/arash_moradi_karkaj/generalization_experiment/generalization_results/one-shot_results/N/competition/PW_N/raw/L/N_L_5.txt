To generate the uppercase English letter "L", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "L" within the allowed space and maintain structural stability according to the gravity rules.
