To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can use a combination of block types b13 and b31. Here is a stream of commands that will create the letter "M":

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)       # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)       # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
top                     # Move to the top of the current stack
ab_drop('b31', 3)       # Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
side                    # Move to the side of the current stack
ab_drop('b13', 5)       # Place a vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 5)       # Place a square block at position 5
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "M" in the Tetris-like environment.
