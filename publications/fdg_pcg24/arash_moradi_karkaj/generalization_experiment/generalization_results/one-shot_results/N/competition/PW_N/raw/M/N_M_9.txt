To generate the uppercase letter "M", we need to stack and position the block types strategically. Here's the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "M":

```
ab_drop('b13',2)  // Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)  // Place another vertical straight block at position 3
top               // Move to the top level
ab_drop('b31',3)  // Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
side              // Move to the side level
ab_drop('b13',5)  // Place a vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b11',5)  // Place a square block at position 5
```

After executing these commands, the blocks should resemble the uppercase letter "M" with proper stacking and stability.
