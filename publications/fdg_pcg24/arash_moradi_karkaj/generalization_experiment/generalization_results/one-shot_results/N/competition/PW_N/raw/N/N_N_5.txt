Here is the stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "N":

```ruby
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
top
ab_drop('b31',3)
side
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

Please note that the command `top` and `side` are not defined in the provided instructions, so I assume they are valid commands to manipulate the blocks in the environment.
