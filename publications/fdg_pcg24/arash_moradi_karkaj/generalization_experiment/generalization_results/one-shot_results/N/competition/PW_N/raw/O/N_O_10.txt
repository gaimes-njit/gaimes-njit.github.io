To generate the capital letter "O" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks ('b13') next to each other at positions 2 and 3 along the width. This will form the sides of the letter.

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') on top of the two vertical blocks, at position 3 along the width. This will form the top of the letter.

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block ('b13') on the right side of the horizontal block, at position 5 along the width. This will complete the letter.

```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

4. Finally, place a square block ('b11') on top of the vertical block, at position 5 along the width. This will create stability and ensure the letter does not collapse.

```
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "O" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
