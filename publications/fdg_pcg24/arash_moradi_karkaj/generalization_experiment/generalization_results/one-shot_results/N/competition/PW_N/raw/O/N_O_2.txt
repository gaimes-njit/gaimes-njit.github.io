To create the uppercase English letter "O" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (`b13`) next to each other at positions 2 and 3:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) on top of the two vertical blocks at position 3:
```
top
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (`b13`) on the right side of the horizontal block at position 5:
```
side
ab_drop('b13',5)
```

4. Finally, place a square block (`b11`) on top of the vertical block at position 5 to complete the letter "O":
```
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "O" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
top
ab_drop('b31',3)
side
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

Please note that the commands should be executed consecutively, following the specified order.
