To create the uppercase English letter "O", we can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) starting from positions 2 and 3.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) starting from position 3.
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) starting from position 5.
4. Finally, place a square block (b11) on top of the vertical straight block at position 5.

The resulting stream of commands would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```
