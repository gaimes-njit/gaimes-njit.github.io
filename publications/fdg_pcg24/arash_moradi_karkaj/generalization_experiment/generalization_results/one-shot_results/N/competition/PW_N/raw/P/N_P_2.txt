To generate the letter "P", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place a third vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',1)  # Place a square block at position 1

This sequence of commands will create a capital letter "P" in the Tetris-like environment while maintaining stability and fitting within the allowed space boundaries.
