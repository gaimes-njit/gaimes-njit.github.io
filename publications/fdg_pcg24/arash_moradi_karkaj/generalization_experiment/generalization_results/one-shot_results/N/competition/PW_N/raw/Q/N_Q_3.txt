To generate the uppercase letter "Q", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 and 3:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous blocks at position 3:
```
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) on the right side of the previous blocks at position 5:
```
ab_drop('b13',5)
```

4. Finally, place a square block (b11) on top of the right side block at position 5:
```
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

When these commands are executed consecutively, they will create the letter "Q" in the Tetris-like environment.
