To generate the uppercase letter "Q", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at positions 2 and 3 along the width:

```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) above the previous two blocks at position 3 along the width:

```
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) next to the previous horizontal block at position 5 along the width:

```
ab_drop('b13',5)
```

4. Finally, place a single square block (b11) on top of the previous vertical block at position 5 along the width to complete the letter "Q":

```
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

By following these commands consecutively, we can create the uppercase letter "Q" in the Tetris-like environment.
