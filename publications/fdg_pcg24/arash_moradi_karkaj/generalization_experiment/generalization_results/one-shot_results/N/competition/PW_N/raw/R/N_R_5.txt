Here is the solution to generate the uppercase letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)      # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)      # Place the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',4)      # Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b11',4)      # Place the third block at position 4
ab_drop('b13',5)      # Place the second vertical block at position 5
ab_drop('b13',6)      # Place the third vertical block at position 6
ab_drop('b11',6)      # Place the fourth block at position 6
ab_drop('b13',7)      # Place the fourth vertical block at position 7
ab_drop('b13',8)      # Place the fifth vertical block at position 8
ab_drop('b31',8)      # Place the fifth horizontal block at position 8
ab_drop('b11',8)      # Place the sixth block at position 8
```

This sequence of commands will generate the letter "R" in the Tetris-like environment, ensuring stacking and stability.
