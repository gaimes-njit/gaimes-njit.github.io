To generate the uppercase letter "R", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)    # Place square block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 4)    # Place vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)    # Place square block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 5)    # Place vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 6)    # Place vertical straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 7)    # Place vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 7)    # Place horizontal straight block at position 7
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "R" within the defined environment and gravity rules.
