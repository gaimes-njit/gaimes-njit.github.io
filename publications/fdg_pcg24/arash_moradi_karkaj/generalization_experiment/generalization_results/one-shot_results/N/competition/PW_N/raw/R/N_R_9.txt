To generate the uppercase letter "R", we need to place the blocks in a specific order. Based on the provided block types, the following sequence of commands would result in the formation of the letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Create the vertical line of the letter
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Create the horizontal line of the letter
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Create the bottom right corner of the letter
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Create the slanted line of the letter
```

By executing the above commands in the given order, the blocks will be placed in such a way that they form the letter "R" within the defined boundaries of the grid.
