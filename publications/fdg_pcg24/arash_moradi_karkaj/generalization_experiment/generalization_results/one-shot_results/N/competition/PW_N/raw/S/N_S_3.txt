To generate the uppercase English letter "S" using the ab_drop() commands and the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the first vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 on the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
```
2. Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 on the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',3)
```
3. Place the top horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 on the width:
```
ab_drop('b31',3)
```
4. Place the side vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 on the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',5)
```
5. Place the small square block (b11) at position 5 on the width:
```
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

By following these steps, we will be able to generate the uppercase English letter "S" within the allowed space boundaries and ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
