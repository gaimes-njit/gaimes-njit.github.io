To create the uppercase letter "S" in the Tetris-like environment, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',2) 
ab_drop('b13',3) 
top 
ab_drop('b31',3) 
side 
ab_drop('b13',5) 
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter "S" within the allowed space boundaries.
