To generate the uppercase letter "S" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 2 and 3 along the width:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   ```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3, aligned with the top of the vertical blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 3)
   ```

3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 5 and 6 along the width, aligned with the right side of the horizontal block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 5)
   ab_drop('b13', 6)
   ```

4. Finally, place a square block (b11) at position 5, aligned with the bottom of the vertical blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 5)
   ```

This sequence of commands will create an uppercase letter "S" in the Tetris-like environment.
