To generate the uppercase letter "U" using the given block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the second and third positions along the width:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13',2)
   ab_drop('b13',3)
   ```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on the third position along the width, starting from the top of the two vertical blocks:
   ```
   top
   ab_drop('b31',3)
   ```

3. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the fifth position along the width, starting from the top of the two vertical blocks and overlapping with the horizontal block:
   ```
   side
   ab_drop('b13',5)
   ab_drop('b13',5)
   ```

4. Place a square block (b11) on the fifth position along the width, starting from the top of the two vertical blocks and overlapping with the horizontal block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11',5)
   ```

The final sequence of commands to generate the uppercase letter "U" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
top
ab_drop('b31',3)
side
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```
