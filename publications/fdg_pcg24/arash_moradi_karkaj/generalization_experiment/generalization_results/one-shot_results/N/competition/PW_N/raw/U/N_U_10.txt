To generate the uppercase letter "U" using the provided block types and environment, you can follow the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position (2,1)
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position (3,1)
top                # Move to the top of the two previously placed blocks
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position (3,2)
side                # Move to the side of the previous block
ab_drop('b13',5)  # Place a vertical straight block at position (5,2)
ab_drop('b11',5)  # Place a square block at position (5,3)
```

Executing these commands will result in the letter "U" being constructed within the defined environment while maintaining stability according to the 2D gravity rules.
