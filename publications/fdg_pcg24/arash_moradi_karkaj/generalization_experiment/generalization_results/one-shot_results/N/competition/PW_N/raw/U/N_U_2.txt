To generate the letter U, we need to stack the blocks in a specific pattern. 

First, we need to place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 on the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

Next, we need to place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 on the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Now, we need to place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 on the width:
```
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

To complete the letter U, we need to place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 on the width:
```
ab_drop('b13',5)
```

And finally, we can add a square block (b11) at position 5 on the width to close the shape:
```
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the letter U would be:
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```
