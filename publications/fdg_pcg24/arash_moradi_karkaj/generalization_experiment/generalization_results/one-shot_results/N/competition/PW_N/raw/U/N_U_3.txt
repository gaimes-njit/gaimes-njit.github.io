To build the letter "U" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 2 and 3.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the second vertical block at position 3.
3. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 5 and 6.
4. Place a small square block (b11) on top of the second vertical block at position 5.

The stream of commands would be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```
