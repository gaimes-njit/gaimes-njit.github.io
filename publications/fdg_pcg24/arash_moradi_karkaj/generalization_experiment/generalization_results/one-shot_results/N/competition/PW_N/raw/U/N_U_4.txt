To generate the uppercase English letter "U" using the block types and commands mentioned, you can follow the following steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 2 and 3 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks at position 3 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) on the right side of the previous horizontal block at position 5 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

4. Place a small square block (b11) on top of the previous vertical block at position 5 along the width.
```
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

This will create the uppercase "U" shape within the defined environment while ensuring stability with gravity rules.
