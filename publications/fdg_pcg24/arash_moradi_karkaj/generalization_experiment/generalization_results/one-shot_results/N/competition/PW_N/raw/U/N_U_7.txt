To create the uppercase letter "U" in the given environment using the ab_drop() command and block types, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)        # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',1)        # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)        # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',3)        # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',5)        # Place the horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13',5)        # Place the vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b11',5)        # Place the square block at position 5
ab_drop('b31',7)        # Place the horizontal straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b13',7)        # Place the vertical straight block at position 7
```

These commands will create a stacked structure that forms the uppercase letter "U" within the allowed boundaries of the grid.
