To generate the letter "U", you should follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) consecutively at positions 2 and 3 along the width.
2. Move the position to the top by using the "top" command.
3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 along the width.
4. Move the position to the side by using the "side" command.
5. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 along the width.
6. Finally, place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 5 along the width.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "U":
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
top
ab_drop('b31',3)
side
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```
