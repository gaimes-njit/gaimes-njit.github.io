To generate the uppercase English letter "U" using the ab_drop() commands and block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at positions 2 and 3 along the width:
``` 
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks at position 3 along the width:
``` 
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) next to the horizontal block at position 5 along the width:
``` 
ab_drop('b13',5)
```

4. Place a square block (b11) on top of the vertical block at position 5 along the width:
``` 
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

By following these steps, you will generate the uppercase English letter "U" in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
