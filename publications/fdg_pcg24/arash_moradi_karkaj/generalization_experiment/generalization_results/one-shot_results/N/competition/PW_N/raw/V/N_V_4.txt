To generate the uppercase letter "V", you should follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 2 and 3 along the width. This will create the two sides of the "V". 

```py
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Next, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 along the width. This will form the connecting part of the "V".

```py
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

3. Finally, complete the top part of the "V" by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 along the width.

```py
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "V" would be:

```py
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
