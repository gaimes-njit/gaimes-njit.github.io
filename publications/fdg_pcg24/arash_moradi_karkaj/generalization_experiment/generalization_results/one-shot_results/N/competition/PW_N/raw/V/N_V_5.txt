To generate the uppercase letter "V," use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

These commands will construct the letter "V" with the specified block types while ensuring structural stability according to the gravity rules.
