To generate the uppercase English letter "V" using the ab_drop() command and block types in the defined environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 2 and 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 along the width, above the previous two blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 along the width, above the horizontal straight block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

4. Place a square block (b11) at position 5 along the width, next to the vertical straight block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

Following these steps will result in the formation of the uppercase English letter "V" within the given environment and gravity rules.
