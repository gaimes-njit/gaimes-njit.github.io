To generate the uppercase letter "V" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 2 and 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This will create the two legs of the "V".

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```
This will create the connecting segment between the legs.

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
This will create the top part of the "V".

4. Finally, place a square block (b11) at position 5 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
This will complete the formation of the uppercase letter "V".

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "V" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
