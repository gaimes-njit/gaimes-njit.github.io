To generate the uppercase English letter "W", you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other. This will form the left side of the letter "W". Use the ab_drop() command to place the blocks at the positions (2,1) and (3,1).

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks. This will form the top of the letter "W". Use the ab_drop() command to place the block at the position (3,1).

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) on top of the horizontal block. This will complete the right side of the letter "W". Use the ab_drop() command to place the block at the position (5,1).

4. Place a small square block (b11) next to the right side of the letter "W". This will add stability to the structure. Use the ab_drop() command to place the block at the position (5,1).

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "W":
```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```
