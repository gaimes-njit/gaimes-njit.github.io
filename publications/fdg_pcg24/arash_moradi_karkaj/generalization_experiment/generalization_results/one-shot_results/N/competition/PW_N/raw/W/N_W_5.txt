To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

``` 
ab_drop('b31', 1) 
ab_drop('b13', 3) 
ab_drop('b31', 5) 
ab_drop('b13', 7) 
ab_drop('b31', 9) 
ab_drop('b13', 11) 
ab_drop('b31', 13) 
ab_drop('b13', 15) 
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable and accurate representation of the letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries.
