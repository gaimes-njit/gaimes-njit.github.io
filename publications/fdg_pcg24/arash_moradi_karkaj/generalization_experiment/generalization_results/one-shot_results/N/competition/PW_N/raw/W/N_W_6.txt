To create the uppercase letter "W" in the given environment, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  // Place vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',2)  // Place horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',4)  // Place vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',5)  // Place horizontal block at position 5
ab_drop('b13',7)  // Place vertical block at position 7
```

By following these commands, we can construct the uppercase letter "W" within the allowed space and in accordance with the gravity rules.

Please note that the blocks are placed one by one, and the X position can be adjusted based on the width of the block type.
