To generate the uppercase letter "X" in the defined environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```Python
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position (1,2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position (1,3)
top                # Move to the top row
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position (1,3)
side               # Move to the side column
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place a vertical straight block at position (1,5)
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place a square block at position (1,5)
```

This sequence of commands will create an uppercase letter "X" in the specified environment, following the stacking and stability rules.
