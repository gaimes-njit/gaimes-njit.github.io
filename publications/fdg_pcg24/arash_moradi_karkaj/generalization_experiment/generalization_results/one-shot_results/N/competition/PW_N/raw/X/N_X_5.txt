To generate the uppercase letter "X" in the defined environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
top
ab_drop('b31',3)
side
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b11',5)
```

These commands will place the blocks in a way that resembles the letter "X" while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
