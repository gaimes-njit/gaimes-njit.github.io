To generate the uppercase letter "Z", we can use the following sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 5)    # Place the vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 5)    # Place the square block at position 5
```

This sequence will create the letter "Z" in the designated environment.
