To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the given code: `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`

2. Place a b13 block on the leftmost slot (0) of the base layer (0) to serve as the left vertical line of the "H". Use the `ab_drop()` function to do this: `ab_drop('b13', 0)`

3. Place a b13 block on the rightmost slot (19) of the base layer (0) to serve as the right vertical line of the "H". Use the `ab_drop()` function to do this: `ab_drop('b13', 19)`

4. Place a b31 block centered on the middle slot (9) of the base layer (0) to serve as the horizontal line of the "H". Use the `ab_drop()` function to do this: `ab_drop('b31', 9)`

5. Now, our structure resembles the character "H", but we need to ensure that it is stable and meets all constraints.

6. For stability, we need to make sure that the b31 block is resting on the b13 blocks. To do this, we can drop two b11 blocks on the left and right slots of the base layer, right below the b31 block. Use the `ab_drop()` function twice: `ab_drop('b11', 8)` and `ab_drop('b11', 10)`

7. Lastly, to ensure that there is no boundary intrusion, we need to drop two more b11 blocks on the leftmost and rightmost slots of the top layer (15). Use the `ab_drop()` function twice: `ab_drop('b11', 0)` and `ab_drop('b11', 19)`

After following these steps, the final structure will resemble the character "H" and will satisfy all the given constraints.
