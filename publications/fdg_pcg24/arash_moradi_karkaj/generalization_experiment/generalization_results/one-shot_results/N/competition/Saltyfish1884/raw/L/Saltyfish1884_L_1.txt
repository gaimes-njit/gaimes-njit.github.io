To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
2. Start by placing a b11 block at the bottom left corner of the structure (slot 0, layer 0). Use the ab_drop() function to vertically drop the block at the desired position.
3. Place a b31 block on top of the b11 block, aligned in the middle. This will form the vertical line of the "L" character.
4. Place another b11 block on top of the b31 block, aligned in the middle. This will form the horizontal line of the "L" character.
5. Place a b13 block on top of the b11 block, aligned in the middle. This will complete the "L" shape.
6. Use the ab_drop() function to vertically drop the remaining blocks at appropriate positions to fill any gaps and ensure stability.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the desired structure is formed.
8. Ensure that the structure is stable by checking if the blocks are correctly placed according to the stability rules mentioned in the constraints.
9. Check if the structure intrudes on the map's boundaries. If it does, adjust the block positions accordingly to minimize boundary intrusion.
10. Once all the blocks are correctly placed, the resulting structure will resemble the character "L".

Here's an example of how the code might look:

```python
W = 20
H = 16

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Place the blocks to form the structure
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Print the resulting structure
print('\n'.join([' '.join(row) for row in structure]))
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L" while meeting all the hard constraints and minimizing boundary intrusion. The resulting structure will be printed at the end.
