To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "W" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet.

2. Place the first b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks). To do this, use the ab_drop() function to drop a b31 block at a suitable slot on the bottom layer (layer 0). Choose a slot that aligns the block center with the middle of the grid (W/2).

3. Place the second b31 block above the first one, also on the solid base. Drop it at a suitable slot on the layer above the base (layer 1). Again, align the block center with the middle of the grid.

4. Place the b11 blocks to form the upper parts of the "W". Use the ab_drop() function to drop two b11 blocks at suitable slots on the layer above the second b31 block (layer 2). Align the block centers with the left and right sides of the structure.

5. Place the b13 block to complete the middle part of the "W". Drop it at a suitable slot on the layer above the b11 blocks (layer 3). Align the block center with the middle of the two b11 blocks.

6. Place the final b11 blocks to form the upper parts of the "W". Use the ab_drop() function to drop two b11 blocks at suitable slots on the layer above the b13 block (layer 4). Align the block centers with the left and right sides of the structure.

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure resembling the character "W" while meeting all the hard stability constraints. Note that the exact positions and order of block placement may vary, but the overall shape of the structure will resemble the given character.

After completing the structure generation, you can print the final result using the provided code snippet.
