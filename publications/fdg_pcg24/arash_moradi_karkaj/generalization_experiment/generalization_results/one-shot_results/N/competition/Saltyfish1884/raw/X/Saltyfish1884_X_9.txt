To generate a stable structure resembling the character "X" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by placing a b13 block at the bottom center of the structure to form the vertical part of the "X". Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block at the appropriate slot.
```
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

3. Place another b13 block just above the first one to extend the vertical part of the "X". Again, use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block at the appropriate slot.
```
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

4. Place a b31 block horizontally on top of the two vertical blocks to form the middle part of the "X". Ensure that the b31 block is placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
```
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

5. Finally, place two b11 blocks diagonally on top of the vertical blocks to form the two diagonal parts of the "X". Again, ensure that the b11 blocks are placed on a solid base.
```
ab_drop('b11', W//2-1)
ab_drop('b11', W//2+1)
```

After following these steps, the `structure` grid will represent a stable structure resembling the character "X" while meeting all the given constraints.

Note: The exact slot numbers for placing the blocks may vary depending on the given initial structure and the order of dropping the blocks.
