To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Z" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the given initialization code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. First, we need to place the b31 block on a solid base to prevent overhangs. We can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the b31 block on the base:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Assuming the character "Z" starts at slot 9
```

3. Next, we need to place the b13 block vertically above the base to complete the "Z" shape. Again, we can use `ab_drop()` to drop the b13 block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Assuming the character "Z" starts at slot 9
```

4. Finally, we need to place the top part of the "Z" shape, which is the b11 block. We can drop the b11 block on top of the b13 block:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Assuming the character "Z" starts at slot 9, drop the b11 block at slot 8
```

After following these steps, the structure grid will resemble the character "Z", meeting all the hard constraints of stability, and no boundary intrusion.

Note that the slot numbers used in the example are just for illustration purposes, and you may need to adjust them to match the desired position and order of the blocks for your specific case.
