First, let's create the base of the letter "C" using a row block ("b31"). The base will have a width of 5 cells and a height of 1 cell.

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Places the row block at x_position = 2
ab_drop("b31", 3)  # Places the row block at x_position = 3
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Places the row block at x_position = 4
ab_drop("b31", 5)  # Places the row block at x_position = 5
ab_drop("b31", 6)  # Places the row block at x_position = 6
```

Next, let's create the top curve of the letter "C" using a column block ("b13"). The top curve will have a width of 1 cell and a height of 3 cells.

```
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Places the column block at x_position = 4, just above the leftmost cell of the base
```

Finally, let's create the bottom curve of the letter "C" using a column block ("b13"). The bottom curve will have a width of 1 cell and a height of 3 cells.

```
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Places the column block at x_position = 4, just below the leftmost cell of the base
```

The complete implementation for generating a structure that looks like the letter "C" in a level is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Places the row block at x_position = 2
ab_drop("b31", 3)  # Places the row block at x_position = 3
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Places the row block at x_position = 4
ab_drop("b31", 5)  # Places the row block at x_position = 5
ab_drop("b31", 6)  # Places the row block at x_position = 6
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Places the column block at x_position = 4, just above the leftmost cell of the base
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Places the column block at x_position = 4, just below the leftmost cell of the base
```
