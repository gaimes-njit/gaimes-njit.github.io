To create the letter "E" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we will follow the hints provided and use the lying-down orientation of the letter "E". We will first create the bottom bar of the letter "E" using a row block (b31), and then add two vertical columns on either side using two square blocks (b11).

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 3)  # Place the row block for the bottom bar
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place the left square block
ab_drop("b11", 8)  # Place the right square block
