The first step is to create the two vertical bars of the letter "K". We will use the column block "b13" for this.

```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 15)
```

Next, we need to create the horizontal bar of the letter "K". We will use the row block "b31" for this.

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Finally, we need to create the diagonal segments of the letter "K". We will use the square block "b11" for this.

```
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 15)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation is:

```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 15)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 15)
```
