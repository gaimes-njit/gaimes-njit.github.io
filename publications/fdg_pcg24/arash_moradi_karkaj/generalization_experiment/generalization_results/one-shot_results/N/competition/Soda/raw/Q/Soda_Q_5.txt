To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Q", we can break it down into different blocks and drop them in a bottom-to-top fashion while ensuring stability.

Let's start by placing the vertical bar of the letter "Q" using the "b13" block. To ensure stability, we need to drop it at the center of the grid at x_position=9.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, let's place the bottom tick of the letter "Q" using the "b31" block. We need to drop it at x_position=9, just below the vertical bar.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Finally, let's place the top bar of the letter "Q" using the "b31" block. We need to drop it at x_position=9, above the vertical bar.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The complete implementation is:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
