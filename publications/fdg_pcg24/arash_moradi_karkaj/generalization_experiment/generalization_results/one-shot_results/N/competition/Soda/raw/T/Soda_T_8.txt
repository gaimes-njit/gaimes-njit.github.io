To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "T" with the highest stability and similarity, we can follow these steps:

1. Drop the base block "b13" in the center of the bottom row to create the horizontal bar of the "T" shape.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

2. Drop the vertical block "b31" above the center point of the horizontal bar to create the vertical line of the "T" shape.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

3. Drop the top block "b13" above the vertical line, aligned with the center of the horizontal bar, to create the top bar of the "T" shape.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Complete implementation:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
