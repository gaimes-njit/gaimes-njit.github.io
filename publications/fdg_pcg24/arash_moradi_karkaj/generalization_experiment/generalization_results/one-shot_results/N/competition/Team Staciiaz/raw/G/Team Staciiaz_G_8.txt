To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "G" and meets all the constraints, we can utilize the `ab_drop()` function and follow the block-stacking problem techniques as described in the environment and constraints.

Here is a potential approach to achieve this:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code snippet.

2. Divide the structure into three main parts: the circular part of "G", the horizontal part of "G", and the vertical part of "G".

3. Drop the circular part of "G":
   - Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop a 'b11' block at an appropriate slot to create the top of the circular part.
   - Drop a 'b31' block below the 'b11' block to create the middle part of the circular part.
   - Drop another 'b11' block below the 'b31' block to complete the circular part.

4. Drop the horizontal part of "G":
   - Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop a 'b31' block at the appropriate slots to create the horizontal line of the "G".

5. Drop the vertical part of "G":
   - Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop a 'b13' block at the appropriate slots to create the vertical line of the "G".

6. Ensure stability:
   - After dropping each block, check if the structure is stable by observing if it collapses or not.
   - If the structure becomes unstable, adjust the dropping positions and orders of the blocks to maintain stability.
   - Iteratively modify the dropping positions and orders until a stable structure that resembles the character "G" is achieved.

7. Ensure no boundary intrusion:
   - While dropping the blocks, make sure that they do not intrude on the boundaries of the map.
   - Adjust the dropping positions and orders to avoid any boundary intrusion.

8. Once you have successfully dropped all the necessary blocks without violating stability and boundary intrusion constraints, you will have a stable structure that looks like the character "G".

Note: The specific dropping positions and order of the blocks may vary depending on the desired shape and stability of the structure. Experimentation and iterative adjustments may be necessary to achieve the best result.
