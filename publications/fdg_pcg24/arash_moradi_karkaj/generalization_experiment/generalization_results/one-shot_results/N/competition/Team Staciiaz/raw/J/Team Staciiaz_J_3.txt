To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "J" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is the step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid of size WxH using the provided code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a vertical block (b13) at the bottom left corner of the structure to act as the base. This will provide stability for the remaining blocks:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Place a horizontal block (b31) two slots to the right of the base block, at a height of 1. This will form the vertical part of the character "J":

```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Place a vertical block (b13) one slot to the right of the previously placed horizontal block, at a height of 3. This will complete the vertical part of the character "J":

```python
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

5. Place a square block (b11) at the top right corner of the structure, at a height of 5. This will form the curved part of the character "J":

```python
ab_drop('b11', 19)
```

6. Place a square block (b11) one slot to the left of the previously placed block, at a height of 5. This will complete the curved part of the character "J":

```python
ab_drop('b11', 18)
```

7. Adjust the position of the blocks to ensure stability. This can be done by moving the blocks left or right until they find a stable position. Repeat this step until the structure is stable.

Note: The specific adjustments required to ensure stability may vary depending on factors such as block weights and sizes. Experimentation and fine-tuning might be necessary.

By following these steps and making necessary adjustments, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "J" while satisfying all the given constraints.
