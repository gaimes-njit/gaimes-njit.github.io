To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. First, we need to drop a b31 block at slot 0 and layer 0 to create the base of the "L":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Next, we can drop a b11 block at slot 3 and layer 1 to create the vertical part of the "L" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

4. Finally, we can drop another b11 block at slot 0 and layer 4 to complete the horizontal part of the "L" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

After executing these steps, the `structure` will contain the following stable structure that looks like the character "L":

```
  x    
  x
  x
xx
```

This structure meets both the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints, as all the blocks are properly placed and do not intrude on the boundary of the map.
