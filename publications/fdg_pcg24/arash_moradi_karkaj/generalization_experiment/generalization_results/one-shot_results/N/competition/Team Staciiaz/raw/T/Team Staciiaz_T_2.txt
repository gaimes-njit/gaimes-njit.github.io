To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "T" while satisfying all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop blocks.

Here is a possible solution:

```python
# Create the base of the structure
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Create the vertical part of the "T" character
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 11)

# Create the horizontal part of the "T" character
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# The structure now resembles the character "T"
```

This solution ensures stability by dropping blocks in a way that creates a balanced structure. It also avoids boundary intrusion by placing the blocks away from the edges of the map.

Note: The code snippet provided is a high-level example and assumes the availability of variables such as `structure`, `width`, and `height`. These variables need to be defined and managed appropriately in the overall code structure.
