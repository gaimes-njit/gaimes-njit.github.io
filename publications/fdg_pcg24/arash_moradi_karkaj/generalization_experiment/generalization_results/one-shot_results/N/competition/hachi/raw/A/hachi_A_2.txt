```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 13)
```

Explanation:

To create the letter "A", we can start by dropping a vertical block `b13` at `x_position` 9 to form the left side of the letter. Next, we drop a horizontal block `b31` at `x_position` 6, followed by three more horizontal blocks at positions 9, 12, and 3 to complete the letter's crossbar.

To add the slanted sides of the letter, we drop four square blocks `b11` at positions 9, 7, 5, 11, and 13. These blocks form the slanted sides of the letter "A", completing the structure.

The resulting structure accurately represents the capital letter "A" while adhering to the constraints of stability and minimal boundary intrusion.
