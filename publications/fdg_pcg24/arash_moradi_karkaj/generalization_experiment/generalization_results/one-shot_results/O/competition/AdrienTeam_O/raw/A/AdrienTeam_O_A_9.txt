To create a stable structure resembling "A" and satisfy all the specified constraints, we need to carefully drop the blocks using the `ab_drop()` function. Here is the code block to generate the "A" structure:

```python
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Base of the "A"
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Middle of the "A"
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Top of the "A"
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Print the structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

By following the block-stacking techniques and considering the constraints, the above code will generate a stable structure resembling the letter "A".
