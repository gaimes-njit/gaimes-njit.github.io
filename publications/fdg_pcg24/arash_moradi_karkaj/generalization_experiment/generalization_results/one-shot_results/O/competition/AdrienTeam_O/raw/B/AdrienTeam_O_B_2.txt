Here is an example solution for constructing the structure resembling "B" while satisfying the given constraints:

```
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Bottom horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Vertical block to form the left side of "B"
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Top horizontal block of "B"
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Vertical block to form the right side of "B"
ab_drop('b13', 4)

# Top horizontal block of "B"
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Top horizontal block of "B" (one unit shifted to the right)
ab_drop('b31', 3)

# Top horizontal block of "B"
ab_drop('b31', 4)

# Vertical block to fill the center of "B"
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Vertical block to fill the center of "B"
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Vertical block to fill the center of "B"
ab_drop('b13', 3)

# Vertical block to fill the center of "B"
ab_drop('b13', 4)

# Vertical block to fill the center of "B"
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Bottom horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Note: This is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid configurations that satisfy the constraints and resemble the shape of "B".
