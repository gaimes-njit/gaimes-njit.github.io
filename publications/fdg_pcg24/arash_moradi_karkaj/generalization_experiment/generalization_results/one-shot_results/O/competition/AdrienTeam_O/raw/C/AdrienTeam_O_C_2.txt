To create a stable structure resembling the letter "C", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid.
2. Drop the first block ('b13') at slot 0 to create the left vertical part of the "C".
3. Drop the second block ('b31') at slot 2 to create the horizontal part of the "C".
4. Drop the third block ('b13') at slot 4 to create the right vertical part of the "C".

Here is the code to generate the structure:

```
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```
