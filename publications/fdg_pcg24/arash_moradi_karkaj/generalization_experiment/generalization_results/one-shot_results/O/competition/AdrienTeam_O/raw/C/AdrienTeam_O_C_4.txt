Here is one possible solution to create a stable structure resembling "C":

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

This solution starts by dropping three vertical blocks ('b13') in slots 0, 1, and 2 to form the vertical part of the "C". Then, three horizontal blocks ('b31') are dropped in the same slots to form the top part of the "C". Finally, two single blocks ('b11') are dropped in slots 1 and 2 to complete the bottom part of the "C".

Note: The specific positions and order of the `ab_drop()` inputs may vary as long as the structure satisfies all the given constraints.
