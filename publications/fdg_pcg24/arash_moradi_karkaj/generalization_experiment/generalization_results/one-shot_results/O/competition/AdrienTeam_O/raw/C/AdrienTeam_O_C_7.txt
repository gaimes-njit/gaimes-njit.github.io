First, let's initialize the structure grid:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Next, we can start building the "C" structure. We will drop the blocks in the following order:

1. Drop the horizontal block on the bottom layer:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Drop the vertical block on the bottom layer:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Drop the vertical block on the top layer:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Drop the horizontal block on the top layer:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

By following these steps, we will create a stable structure resembling the letter "C".

The final code block with all the `ab_drop()` calls is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
