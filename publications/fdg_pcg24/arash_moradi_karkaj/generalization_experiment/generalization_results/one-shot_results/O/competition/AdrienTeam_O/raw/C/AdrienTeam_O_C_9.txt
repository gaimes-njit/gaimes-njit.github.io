Here is the code block that generates the structure of the "C" character:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

Explanation:
1. The first line drops a horizontal block ('b31') centered at slot 1 in layer 0.
2. The second line drops a square block ('b11') centered at slot 0 in layer 1, forming the upper-left corner of the "C".
3. The third line drops another horizontal block ('b31') centered at slot 2 in layer 1, extending the "C" to the right.
4. The fourth line drops a horizontal block ('b31') centered at slot 0 in layer 2, extending the vertical line of the "C" downward.

Together, these four `ab_drop()` calls generate a stable structure resembling the letter "C" while satisfying all the given constraints.
