To create a stable structure resembling "D" by using the `ab_drop()` function, the following steps can be taken:

1. Initialize the map with an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Rotate the 'L' character to achieve the desired shape. In this case, rotating the 'L' shape clockwise will produce the shape of "D".

3. Determine the position and order for each block to be dropped, following the given constraints.

Based on the provided constraints, a possible sequence of `ab_drop()` calls to create the "D" shape could be:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Drop vertical block in the middle (slot 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)    # Drop horizontal block above vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 3)    # Drop vertical block on the right (slot 3)
ab_drop('b13', 0)    # Drop vertical block on the left (slot 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)    # Drop horizontal block above left vertical block
ab_drop('b11', 2)    # Drop horizontal block above right vertical block
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will generate the stable structure resembling "D" that satisfies all the specified constraints.
