To construct a stable structure resembling "E" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first row of the "E", which is a horizontal block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Drop the second row of the "E", which is a vertical block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Drop the third row of the "E", which is another horizontal block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. Drop the fourth row of the "E", which is a vertical block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

6. Drop the fifth row of the "E", which is a horizontal block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

7. Drop the sixth row of the "E", which is a vertical block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

8. The "E" structure is complete!

The final code block would be:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
