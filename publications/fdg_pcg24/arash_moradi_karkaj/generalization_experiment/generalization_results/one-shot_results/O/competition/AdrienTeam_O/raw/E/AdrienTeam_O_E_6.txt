To create the structure resembling "E", we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid with an empty WxH grid.
2. Drop the first block ('b13') at slot 0 to create the vertical bar of the "E".
3. Drop the second block ('b31') at slot 1 to create the top horizontal bar of the "E".
4. Drop the third block ('b11') at slot 0 to create the middle horizontal bar of the "E".
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 in slots 2 and 3 to create the bottom horizontal bar of the "E".

Therefore, the code block to generate the structure would be:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

This set of `ab_drop()` inputs will create the stable structure resembling the letter "E" while adhering to the given constraints.
