To create a stable structure resembling the letter "E" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully position and stack the blocks in the correct order. Here is a possible solution that satisfies all the specified constraints:

```python
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the blocks to form the letter E
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

This solution starts building the E from the bottom layer (layer 0) upwards. 

- We first drop a horizontal block ('b31') in the middle slot (slot 1).
- Then, we drop two vertical blocks ('b13') in slots 0 and 2, respectively, to form the vertical parts of the E.
- Finally, we drop three horizontal blocks ('b11') in the middle slot (slot 1) to complete the horizontal part of the E.

By following these steps, we can create a stable structure resembling the letter "E" that satisfies all the given constraints.
