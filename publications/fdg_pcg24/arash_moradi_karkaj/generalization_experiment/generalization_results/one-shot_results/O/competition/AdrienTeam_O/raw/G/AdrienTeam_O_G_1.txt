To create a stable structure resembling the letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. First, initialize the structure:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the initial block in the first slot of the bottom layer to serve as the base:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Drop the second block in the second slot of the bottom layer to connect with the base and form the upper part of the "G":
```python
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

4. Drop the third block in the second slot of the second layer to form the vertical part of the "G":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

5. Drop the final block in the second slot of the third layer to complete the horizontal part of the "G":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Putting it all together, the code block would look like this:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will create a stable structure resembling the letter "G" that satisfies all the specified constraints.
