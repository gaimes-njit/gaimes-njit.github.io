To create a stable structure resembling "H", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` function calls:

```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This sequence of function calls will drop the blocks in the correct order and position to form the shape of an "H". We start by dropping two horizontal blocks ('b31') on slots 0 and 1 to form the top and bottom of the left vertical part of the "H". Then, we drop two vertical blocks ('b13') on slots 0 and 2 to complete the left vertical part of the "H".

Next, we drop three horizontal blocks ('b31') on slots 0, 1, and 2 to form the middle part of the "H". Finally, we drop a horizontal block ('b31') on slot 2 to complete the right vertical part of the "H".

By following this sequence of `ab_drop()` function calls, we ensure that the structure satisfies all the specified constraints and forms a stable and proportionate shape resembling an "H".
