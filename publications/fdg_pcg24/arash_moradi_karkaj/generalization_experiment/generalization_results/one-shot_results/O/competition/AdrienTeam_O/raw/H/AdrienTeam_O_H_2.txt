The code to generate the structure resembling "H" is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Explanation:
1. The first line drops a vertical block `b13` in the center slot of the bottom layer (layer 0).
2. The second line drops a horizontal block `b31` in the leftmost slot of the second layer (layer 1).
3. The third to fifth lines drop three vertical blocks `b11` in the center slot of the third layer (layer 2). These blocks combine to form the left vertical line of the "H".
4. The sixth line drops a horizontal block `b31` in the rightmost slot of the third layer (layer 2). This block forms the top horizontal line of the "H".
5. The seventh line drops a vertical block `b13` in the center slot of the fourth layer (layer 3). This block forms the right vertical line of the "H".

This sequence of `ab_drop()` inputs creates a stable structure resembling the letter "H" while satisfying all the given constraints.
