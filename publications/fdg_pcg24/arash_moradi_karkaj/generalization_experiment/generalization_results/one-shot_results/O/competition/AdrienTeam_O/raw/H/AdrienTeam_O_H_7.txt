To create a stable structure resembling "H" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to drop the blocks in a specific order and position to satisfy the constraints. Given that the blocks should align with the center of the specified slot, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure by creating an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the blocks to form the base of the "H" structure:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will create the base of the "H" structure.

3. Add the vertical pillar of the "H" structure:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```
This will form the vertical pillar of the "H" structure.

4. Add the horizontal bar of the "H" structure:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```
This will create the horizontal bar of the "H" structure.

The complete code block with the `ab_drop()` calls to generate the "H" structure is as follows:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)

ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)

ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

By following these steps and positioning the blocks in the specified order, we can create a stable structure resembling the letter "H" that satisfies all the given constraints.
