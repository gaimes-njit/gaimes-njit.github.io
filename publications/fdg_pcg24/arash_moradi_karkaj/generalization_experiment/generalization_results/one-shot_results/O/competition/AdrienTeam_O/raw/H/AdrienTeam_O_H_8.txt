To create an "H" structure using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow the given constraints and guidelines. Here is one possible solution:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

This solution starts by dropping three horizontal blocks ('b31') centered at slot 2 to create the middle part of the "H". Then, three vertical blocks ('b13') are dropped at slots 1 and 3 to create the two side parts of the "H".

Following these instructions will result in a stable structure resembling the letter "H" while satisfying all the specified constraints.
