To create a stable structure resembling "I" while satisfying all the given constraints, we need to drop the blocks in a specific order and position. Based on the provided information and constraints, we can use the following `ab_drop()` calls to generate the structure:

```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

This set of calls will drop all the blocks in a vertical line, aligning their centers with slot 9, which will create a stable structure resembling the letter "I".
