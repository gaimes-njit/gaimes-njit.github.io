To create a stable structure resembling the letter "I" while adhering to the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in the correct order and position. Here's the solution:

```python
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Dropping the blocks to form the "I" structure
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

By following this sequence of `ab_drop()` calls, we ensure that the blocks are dropped from bottom to top, adhering to the given constraints. The blocks are placed in a way to form the shape of the letter "I".
