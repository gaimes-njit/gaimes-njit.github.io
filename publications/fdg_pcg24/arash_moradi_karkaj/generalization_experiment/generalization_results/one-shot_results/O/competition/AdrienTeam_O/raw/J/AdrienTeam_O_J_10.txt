To generate a stable structure resembling "J" while adhering to the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. To start building the "J" shape from the bottom layer, we need to determine the order and position of the blocks being dropped.

3. Drop the first block (`b31`) at slot 1 to create the horizontal part of the "J" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Drop the second block (`b13`) at slot 0 to create the vertical part of the "J" shape:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

5. Drop the third block (`b13`) at slot 2 to complete the vertical part of the "J" shape:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

6. Drop the fourth block (`b31`) at slot 1 to connect the vertical and horizontal parts of the "J" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

The final structure resembling "J" can be generated using the following code block:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
