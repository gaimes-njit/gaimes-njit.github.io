First, we need to initialize the map structure using the provided code:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Next, we can start building the "K" structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15).

To construct the bottom-left vertical part of the "K", we can use the following `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

To construct the bottom-horizontal part of the "K", we can use the following `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

To construct the top-left vertical part of the "K", we can use the following `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

Finally, to construct the top-horizontal part of the "K", we can use the following `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```
