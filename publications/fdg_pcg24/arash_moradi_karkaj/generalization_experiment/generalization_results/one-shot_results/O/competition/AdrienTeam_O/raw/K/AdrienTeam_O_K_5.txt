To build a structure resembling the letter "K" using the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the map with an empty grid:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block ('b13') in the middle of the bottom layer:

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

3. Drop the second block ('b11') to form the top part of the vertical line:

```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

4. Drop the third block ('b11') to form the bottom part of the vertical line:

```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

5. Drop the fourth block ('b31') to form the horizontal line:

```
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

6. Drop the fifth block ('b13') to complete the horizontal line:

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

The final code block for generating the structure resembling "K" is as follows:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
