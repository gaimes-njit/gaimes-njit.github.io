To create a stable structure resembling the letter "L" while satisfying the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the map structure with an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start building the "L" structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15).

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks vertically, aligning their centers with the desired slots.

4. Place the blocks in the correct order and position to form the "L" shape. Rotate the shape if necessary.

Based on the provided constraints, a possible solution to create the "L" structure is as follows:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Note: The above solution assumes that the slots are numbered from left to right starting from 0.
