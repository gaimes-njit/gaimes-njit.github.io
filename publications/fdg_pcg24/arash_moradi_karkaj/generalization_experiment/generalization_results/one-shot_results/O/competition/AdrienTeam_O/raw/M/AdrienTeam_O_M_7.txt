To construct a stable structure resembling the letter "M" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block, which will be a horizontal block with a width of 2 units and a height of 1 unit, aligned with the center slot. This block will form the base of the "M":
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

3. Drop the second block, which will be a vertical block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 2 units, aligned with the center slot. This block will form the left side of the top part of the "M":
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

4. Drop the third block, which will be a vertical block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 2 units, aligned with the center slot. This block will form the right side of the top part of the "M":
```python
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

5. Drop the fourth block, which will be a horizontal block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit, aligned with the center slot. This block will form the middle part of the "M":
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the letter "M" and satisfies all the specified constraints.

Here is the complete code block with the `ab_drop()` calls:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```
