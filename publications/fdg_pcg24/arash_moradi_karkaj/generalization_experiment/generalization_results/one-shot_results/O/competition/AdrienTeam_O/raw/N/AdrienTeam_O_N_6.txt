Here is one possible solution to create a stable structure resembling "N":

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # First, drop a 'b11' block at slot 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Then, drop another 'b11' block at slot 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Next, drop a 'b31' block at slot 3 to create the horizontal part of the "N"
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Finally, drop a 'b13' block at slot 4 to create the vertical part of the "N"
```

By following these `ab_drop()` calls, we can construct a stable structure that resembles the shape of the letter "N" and satisfies all the given constraints.
