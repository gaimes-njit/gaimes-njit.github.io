To create a structure resembling the letter "P" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to consider the constraints and manipulate the blocks accordingly. Here is a possible solution:

```
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks
ab_drop('b31', 0)   # Drop the base horizontal block at slot 0
ab_drop('b11', 0)   # Drop the vertical block at slot 0
ab_drop('b11', 0)   # Drop the vertical block at slot 0
ab_drop('b11', 0)   # Drop the vertical block at slot 0, equivalent to b13
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Drop the horizontal block at slot 2

# Print the structure
for row in structure:
    print(row)
```

The above code generates a structure resembling the letter "P" using the provided block types and the `ab_drop()` function while adhering to the given constraints.
