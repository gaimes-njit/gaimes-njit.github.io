Here is the solution for creating a stable structure resembling "R":

```python
# Initialize the map
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the first blocks to start building "R"
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Top horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 0)   # Left vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Right vertical block
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Bottom horizontal block
```

This solution follows the provided constraints and creates a stable structure resembling the letter "R".
