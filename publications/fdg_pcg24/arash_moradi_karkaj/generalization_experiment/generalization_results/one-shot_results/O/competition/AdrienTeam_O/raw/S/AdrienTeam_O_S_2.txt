To create a structure resembling "S" using the `ab_drop()` function and considering all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid with an empty WxH grid:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the blocks in the following order to create the "S" shape:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b11', 2)
   ab_drop('b11', 1)
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ab_drop('b11', 3)
   ab_drop('b11', 2)
   ```

3. The final structure will resemble the "S" shape.

The complete code block for generating the structure is as follows:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

This code block will output the sequence of `ab_drop()` inputs required to create the "S" structure while satisfying all the constraints.
