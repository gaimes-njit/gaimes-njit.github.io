To create the structure resembling "S" using the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure grid:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the blocks in the desired order and position.

3. Rotate the 'S' shape if necessary to achieve the desired orientation.

4. Ensure that the blocks do not extend beyond the map boundaries and that the y-coordinate corresponds to the block's center.

Here is the code snippet to generate the "S" structure:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the first block
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Drop the second block
ab_drop('b11', 3)

# Drop the third block
ab_drop('b11', 4)

# Drop the fourth block
ab_drop('b31', 5)

# Drop the fifth block
ab_drop('b11', 6)

# Drop the sixth block
ab_drop('b11', 7)

# Drop the seventh block
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Drop the eighth block
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the ninth block
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Drop the tenth block
ab_drop('b13', 8)

# Drop the eleventh block
ab_drop('b31', 7)

# Drop the twelfth block
ab_drop('b11', 6)

# Drop the thirteenth block
ab_drop('b11', 5)

# Drop the fourteenth block
ab_drop('b31', 4)

# Drop the fifteenth block
ab_drop('b11', 3)

# Drop the sixteenth block
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Please note that this is one possible solution among many variations that can achieve the same result. The goal is to adhere to the constraints and generate a structure resembling the letter "S" using the ab_drop() function.
