To create a stable structure resembling "S" and meet all the given constraints, the following `ab_drop()` calls can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)    # Drop the vertical block at slot 0
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Drop the horizontal block at slot 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Drop the vertical block at slot 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)    # Drop the horizontal block at slot 3
```

Please note that the order and position of the blocks being dropped are crucial to create a stable and continuous structure resembling "S".
