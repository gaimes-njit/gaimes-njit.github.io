The structure for the "T" can be built using the `ab_drop()` function with the following inputs:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

Explanation:
- The first two `ab_drop('b31', 1)` calls create the top part of the "T" where the horizontal block is placed in the middle.
- The next two `ab_drop('b13', 0)` and `ab_drop('b13', 2)` calls create the vertical blocks on either side of the horizontal block, forming the vertical part of the "T".
- The next `ab_drop('b31', 1)` call creates the horizontal block at the bottom of the "T", completing the structure.
- Finally, the last two `ab_drop('b11', 1)` calls add stability to the structure by adding two additional blocks on top of the bottom horizontal block.

This set of `ab_drop()` calls will generate a stable structure resembling the letter "T" that satisfies all the specified constraints.
