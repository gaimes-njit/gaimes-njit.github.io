The structure can be built by following these steps:

1. Initialize the structure with an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block, which will be a vertical block (b13) in the center of the map:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

3. Drop the second block, which will be a horizontal block (b31) below the first block, aligning its center with the center of the first block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

4. Drop the third block, which will be a vertical block (b13) next to the first block, aligning its center with the center of the first block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

5. Drop the fourth block, which will be a vertical block (b13) next to the first block, aligning its center with the center of the first block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

6. The structure has been successfully built.

Here is the complete code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```
