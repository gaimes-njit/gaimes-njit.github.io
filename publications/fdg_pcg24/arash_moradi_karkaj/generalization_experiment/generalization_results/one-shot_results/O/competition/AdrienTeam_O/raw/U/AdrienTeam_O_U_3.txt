As an AI language model, I can provide you with a solution to construct a stable structure resembling the letter "U" while adhering to the given constraints. Here is the code to generate the structure using the `ab_drop()` function:

```python
# Define the map dimensions
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers

# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks to form the bottom horizontal part of the "U"
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Drop the blocks to form the left vertical part of the "U"
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Drop the blocks to form the right vertical part of the "U"
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Output the ab_drop() calls within a code block
print("```")
print("ab_drop('b31', 1)")
print("ab_drop('b11', 0)")
print("ab_drop('b11', 2)")
print("ab_drop('b31', 1)")
print("ab_drop('b13', 0)")
print("ab_drop('b13', 0)")
print("ab_drop('b13', 2)")
print("ab_drop('b13', 2)")
print("```")
```

Please note that the code provided assumes that you have already defined the `ab_drop()` function correctly. Make sure to also replace any prohibited calls such as `ab_drop('b31', 0)` with the appropriate alternative.
