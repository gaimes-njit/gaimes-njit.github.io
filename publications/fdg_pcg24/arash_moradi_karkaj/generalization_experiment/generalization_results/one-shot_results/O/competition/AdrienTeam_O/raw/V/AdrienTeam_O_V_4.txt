Here is one way to use the `ab_drop()` function to create a stable structure resembling "V" while satisfying the given constraints:

```
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Place the horizontal block at the bottom of the structure
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the vertical blocks to create the two sides of the "V"
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Place the horizontal block at the top of the structure
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

In this structure, the blocks are dropped in the following order:

1. Horizontal block at the bottom (using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`)
2. Vertical block on the left side (using `ab_drop('b13', 8)`)
3. Vertical block on the right side (using `ab_drop('b13', 10)`)
4. Horizontal block at the top (using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`)

These `ab_drop()` calls create a stable "V"-shaped structure while adhering to the given constraints.
