To create a stable structure resembling "X", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the blocks to form the shape of "X" in a single figure:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

The code above drops the blocks in the following order:
- The first block is a horizontal block ('b31') dropped at slot 1 to form the top part of the "X".
- The second and third blocks are vertical blocks ('b13') dropped at slots 0 and 2 to form the arms of the "X".
- The fourth block is a horizontal block ('b31') dropped at slot 1 to form the bottom part of the "X".

Note: The order and position at which the blocks are dropped are crucial to create a stable structure that satisfies all the constraints.
