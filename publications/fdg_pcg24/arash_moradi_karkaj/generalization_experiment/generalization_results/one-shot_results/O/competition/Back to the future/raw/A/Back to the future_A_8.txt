To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to follow the block-stacking problem techniques and meet all the hard constraints.

Here's a step-by-step approach to building the structure:

1. Initialize the structure by creating an empty grid with dimensions WxH:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the base block (b31) to create a stable foundation for the structure:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

3. Drop the first vertical block (b13) on top of the base block to form the left side of the "A":
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

4. Drop the second vertical block (b13) on top of the base block to form the right side of the "A":
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 11)
   ```

5. Drop the top horizontal block (b31) to connect the two vertical blocks and complete the "A":
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

6. Verify the stability of the structure after each drop by checking if any blocks are floating in mid-air or unsupported.
   - For example, after dropping the base block, check if any block on top is stable by verifying that the slots underneath it are filled.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 multiple times with randomized drop positions and block types to generate diverse structures that resemble the uppercase character "A".

By following these steps and ensuring stability at each drop, you can generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A" while meeting all the hard constraints.
