One possible approach to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "F" while satisfying all the hard constraints is as follows:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the map initialization code: `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the center bottom of the structure. Use the `ab_drop()` function with `x = 'b31'` and `y = W // 2 - 1` to drop the block and update the structure.

3. Check the stability of the structure after each drop. To do this, iterate through the structure from bottom to top and check if any block in a row has no support below it. If such a block is found, the structure is not stable and needs to be adjusted.

4. To provide support for the b31 block, drop a b11 block on top of it. Use the `ab_drop()` function with `x = 'b11'` and `y = W // 2 - 1` to drop the block and update the structure.

5. Check the stability of the structure again and adjust if necessary.

6. To create the upright part of the "F", drop a b13 block on top of the existing b31 block. Use the `ab_drop()` function with `x = 'b13'` and `y = W // 2 - 1` to drop the block and update the structure.

7. Check the stability of the structure again and adjust if necessary.

8. Finally, drop another b11 block on top of the upright part of the "F" to complete the structure. Use the `ab_drop()` function with `x = 'b11'` and `y = W // 2 - 2` to drop the block and update the structure.

9. Check the stability of the structure one last time and adjust if necessary.

10. The final structure will resemble the uppercase letter "F" and meet all the hard constraints.

Note: The process described above only generates one possible solution for the uppercase letter "F." To generate different structures, you can try different drop positions and orders while ensuring stability and satisfying the constraints.
