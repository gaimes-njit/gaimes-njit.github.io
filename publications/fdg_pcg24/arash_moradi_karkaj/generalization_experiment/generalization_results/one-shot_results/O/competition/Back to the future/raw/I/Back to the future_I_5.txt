To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "I" and meets all the given hard constraints, we will need to carefully plan the placement of each block using the `ab_drop()` function. Here is a possible approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block in the center (slot 9) of layer 14 using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`. This will serve as the main vertical section of the "I" character. Update the structure accordingly.

3. Proceed by dropping a b11 block in slot 9 of layer 13 using `ab_drop('b11', 9)`. This block will serve as the center of the "I" character.

4. To complete the upper horizontal section of the "I" character, drop two b31 blocks on slots 5 and 13 of layer 12 using `ab_drop('b31', 5)` and `ab_drop('b31', 13)`.

5. Next, drop a b11 block in slot 9 of layer 11 using `ab_drop('b11', 9)`.

6. To create the lower vertical section of the "I" character, drop a b13 block in slot 9 of layer 5 using `ab_drop('b13', 9)`.

7. Finally, drop a b11 block in slot 9 of layer 4 using `ab_drop('b11', 9)` to complete the lower section.

By following these steps, you should be able to generate a stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "I" while satisfying the given hard constraints.
