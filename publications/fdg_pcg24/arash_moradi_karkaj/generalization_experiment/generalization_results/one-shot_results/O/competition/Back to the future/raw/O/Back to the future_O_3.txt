To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "O" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code: `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Begin by dropping a b31 block at slot 9, which will be the center of the "O" structure. Call `ab_drop('b31', 9)` and store the drop coordinates.

3. To ensure the stability of the structure, check the stability of the newly dropped block. Iterate through each layer from the drop position upwards, starting from the top of the structure.

4. Check the stability by verifying that the blocks below the current layer are either empty or have sufficient support. If necessary, drop additional blocks to provide support using the `ab_drop()` function.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the remaining blocks, dropping a b13 block above and below the center block at slots 8 and 10, respectively, and dropping three b11 blocks above the b13 block at slots 7, 9, and 11.

6. After each drop, check the stability of the structure and continue building upwards using the same stability check process as in step 4.

7. Finally, once all blocks have been dropped and the stability of the entire structure has been verified, the resulting structure will resemble the uppercase character "O".

Note: The actual coordinates and number of blocks may vary depending on the specific requirements or variations of the block-stacking problem, but the general approach of dropping blocks and checking stability remains the same.
