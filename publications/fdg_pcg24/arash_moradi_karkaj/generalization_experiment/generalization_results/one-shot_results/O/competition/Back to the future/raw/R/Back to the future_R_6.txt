To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "R" using the `ab_drop()` function and satisfy all the hard constraints, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block, a vertical block b13, at the center of the bottom layer.
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

3. Drop the second block, a horizontal block b31, at the center of the layer above the base to support the vertical block.
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

4. Drop the third block, a vertical block b13, at the center of the layer above the previous blocks.
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

5. Drop the fourth block, a horizontal block b31, one slot to the right of the previous blocks.
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2+1)
```

6. Drop the fifth block, a square block b11, one slot to the right of the previous blocks.
```python
ab_drop('b11', W//2+2)
```

7. Drop the sixth block, a vertical block b13, one slot to the right of the previous blocks.
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2+2)
```

8. Repeat steps 4-7, but drop the blocks one slot to the left of the previous blocks, until the desired height is reached. This will create the curved shape of the uppercase character "R".

9. Once the upper part of the character is complete, drop the final block, a horizontal block b31, at the center of the top layer to complete the structure.
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "R" while satisfying all the hard constraints.
