To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "S" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid as an empty WxH grid.
2. Drop a b31 block at slot 8 to form the base of the "S" shape. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b31, 8).
3. Drop a b31 block at slot 9 above the previous one to provide stability. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b31, 9).
4. Drop a b31 block at slot 10 above the previous one to complete the base of the "S" shape. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b31, 10).
5. Drop a b13 block at slot 6 above the base to start forming the first curve of the "S" shape. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b13, 6).
6. Drop a b13 block at slot 10 above the previous one to complete the first curve of the "S" shape. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b13, 10).
7. Drop a b13 block at slot 11 above the previous one to start forming the second curve of the "S" shape. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b13, 11).
8. Drop a b13 block at slot 15 above the previous one to complete the second curve of the "S" shape. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b13, 15).
9. Drop a b11 block at slot 5 above the base to connect the curves of the "S" shape. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b11, 5).
10. Drop a b11 block at slot 6 above the previous one to fill the gap in the curves. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b11, 6).
11. Drop a b11 block at slot 7 above the previous one to continue filling the gap in the curves. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b11, 7).
12. Drop a b11 block at slot 11 above the previous one to continue filling the gap in the curves. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b11, 11).
13. Drop a b11 block at slot 12 above the previous one to continue filling the gap in the curves. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b11, 12).
14. Drop a b11 block at slot 13 above the previous one to continue filling the gap in the curves. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b11, 13).
15. Drop a b11 block at slot 14 above the previous one to continue filling the gap in the curves. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b11, 14).
16. Drop a b11 block at slot 15 above the previous one to continue filling the gap in the curves. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b11, 15).
17. Drop a b11 block at slot 9 above the base to complete the "S" shape. Call the ab_drop() function with parameters (b11, 9).

After following these steps, the structure grid will have a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "S". The ab_drop() function is used to simulate dropping the blocks and placing them in the structure grid at the correct positions to form the desired shape.
