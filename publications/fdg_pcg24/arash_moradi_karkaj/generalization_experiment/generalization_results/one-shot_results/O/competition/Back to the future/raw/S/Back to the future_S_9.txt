To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "S" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to follow the given constraints and utilize the block stacking techniques. Here is a possible solution:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Begin by dropping the first block type (b13) at the bottom layer (layer 0) and the center slot (y = 10) using `ab_drop('b13', 10)`. This will provide a stable base for the structure.

3. Drop the second block type (b31) at layer 1, aligned with the previously dropped block's center slot (y=10) using `ab_drop('b31', 10)`. This will create the first curve of the "S".

4. Drop the third block type (b13) at layer 2, aligned with the previously dropped block's center slot (y=10) using `ab_drop('b13', 10)`. This will create the middle horizontal line of the "S".

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, dropping two more sets of b31 and b13 blocks in layers 3-4 and 5-6 using the same center slot (y=10), respectively. This will complete the upper part of the "S".

6. To add stability and symmetry, drop two b31 blocks on the left side of the structure, aligned with the leftmost slots (y=0). Place one b31 at layer 3 and another at layer 5, using `ab_drop('b31', 0)`.

7. Finally, drop one b31 block on the right side of the structure, aligned with the rightmost slot (y=19), at layer 4 using `ab_drop('b31', 19)`.

Make sure to check the stability and constraints before each drop using appropriate techniques from the block-stacking problem.

Remember to keep track of the coordinates of each `ab_drop()` call to list the drop positions as per the constraints.

This approach should generate a stable structure resembling the uppercase character "S" while satisfying the given hard constraints.
