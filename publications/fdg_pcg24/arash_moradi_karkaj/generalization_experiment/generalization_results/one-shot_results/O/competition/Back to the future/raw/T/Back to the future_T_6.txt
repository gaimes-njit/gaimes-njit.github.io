To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "T" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the following approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided map initialization code.

2. Determine the drop positions for each block type to construct the structure.
   - For the b31 block, we can drop it at the center slot of the bottom layer (layer 0) to ensure stability.
   - For the b11 blocks, we can drop them at the appropriate slots that form the vertical part of the "T" shape. The exact positions can be determined based on the desired shape and stability.
   - For the b13 block, we can drop it at the appropriate slot that forms the horizontal part of the "T" shape. The position can be determined based on the desired shape and stability.

3. Use the ab_drop() function to drop each block at its determined position, ensuring stability before each drop.

4. After dropping all the blocks, the structure should resemble the uppercase letter "T" and meet the stability constraint.

Note: The exact positions and order of dropping the blocks may vary based on the desired outcome and the specific constraints of the structure. The provided approach is a general guideline to achieve the goal.
