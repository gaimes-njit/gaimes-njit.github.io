To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "U" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b13 block at slot 0 to create the left side of the "U":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Drop the b31 block at slot 2 to create the top of the "U":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

4. Drop the b13 block at slot 4 to create the right side of the "U":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

5. The structure should now resemble the uppercase letter "U" and meet the stability constraint.

Here is the code to implement the above steps:

```python
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Function to check stability
def is_stable(row, column):
    if row == H-1:
        return True
    elif structure[row+1][column] != ' ':
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Function to drop a block and update the structure
def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Drop b13 block at slot 0
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Drop b31 block at slot 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Drop b13 block at slot 4
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

By following these steps, we generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "U" and meets all the hard constraints.
