To generate a structure resembling the capital letter "C", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() function calls:

ab_drop('b31', 9)  # drop a horizontal block in the center position
ab_drop('b31', 12)  # drop another horizontal block to the right
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # drop a vertical block on top of the first horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 12)  # drop a vertical block on top of the second horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # drop a vertical block to the left of the first horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 13)  # drop a vertical block to the right of the second horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # drop another horizontal block on top of the first vertical block
ab_drop('b31', 12)  # drop another horizontal block on top of the second vertical block
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # drop another horizontal block on top, slightly to the left of the second vertical block

The resulting structure will resemble the capital letter "C" and satisfy the constraints mentioned in the prompt.
