To form the shape resembling the letter "B", we need to place bricks in the following pattern:

1. Place a b31 brick horizontally at position (6, 0). This brick will occupy the cells (5, 0), (6, 0), and (7, 0).

2. Place a b13 brick vertically at position (5, 1). This brick will occupy the cells (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3).

3. Place a b11 brick at position (8, 0). This brick will occupy the cell (8, 0).

```python
# Map initialization
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check if a cell is occupied by a brick
def is_occupied(x, y):
    return field[y][x] == 1

# Function to place a brick on the field
def place_brick(x, y, width, height):
    for i in range(width):
        for j in range(height):
            field[y+j][x+i] = 1


# Place the bricks to form the letter "B"
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
place_brick(8, 0, 1, 1)
```

This code will place the bricks on the field and form a shape resembling the letter "B" while satisfying the important notes mentioned in the description.
