To generate the shape resembling the letter "V", we can use the ab_drop() function to place the bricks in a specific sequence. Here is the code to generate the required structure:

```python
# Map initialization
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check if a cell is occupied
def is_occupied(x, y):
    if x < 0 or x >= 20 or y < 0 or y >= 16:
        return True
    return field[y][x] == 1

# Function to place bricks
def place_brick(brick, x_position):
    if brick == 'b11':
        for x in range(x_position, x_position + 1):
            if is_occupied(x, 0):
                return False
            field[0][x] = 1
        return True
    elif brick == 'b13':
        for y in range(0, 3):
            if is_occupied(x_position, y):
                return False
            field[y][x_position] = 1
        return True
    elif brick == 'b31':
        for x in range(x_position - 1, x_position + 2):
            if is_occupied(x, 3):
                return False
            field[3][x] = 1
        return True

# Place bricks to form the structure resembling the letter "V"
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the first brick
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Place the second brick

# Printing the resulting field
for row in field:
    print(row)
```

This code will generate a structure resembling the letter "V" using bricks of type 'b31' and 'b13'. The `place_brick` function checks if the cells to be occupied by the brick are already occupied or outside the boundaries of the field. The `is_occupied` function is used to check if a cell is occupied. The resulting field is printed at the end.

Please note that the `ab_drop` function is provided by the game, and you can use it to place the bricks at specific positions. The code provided here demonstrates how to use the `ab_drop` function to generate the desired structure.
