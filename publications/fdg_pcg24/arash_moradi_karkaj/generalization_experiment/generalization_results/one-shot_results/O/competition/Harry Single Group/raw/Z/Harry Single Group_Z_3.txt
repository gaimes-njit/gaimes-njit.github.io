To form the shape resembling the letter "Z", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() function calls:

1. Position and drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5: `ab_drop('b31', 5)`
2. Position and drop a b13 brick at x_position = 5: `ab_drop('b13', 5)`
3. Position and drop a b31 brick at x_position = 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

This sequence of function calls will place the bricks in the required positions to form the "Z" shape on the field. 

Here's how the structure will look like on the field:

```
                        ┌─┐                
       ┌─┐              │ │                
       │ │              └─┘                
       │ │                               
 ──────┴─┴───────                  
```

To satisfy the important notes:
1. Stability: The bricks are stacked vertically with their points of contact serving as the pivot. The number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot is the same for both bricks, ensuring stability.
2. Boundary Collisions: The occupied cells of the bricks do not exceed the boundaries of the field.
3. Map Initialization: The code for initializing the field and executing the ab_drop() function calls should be written between the last 2 pairs of three backticks.
