To generate the uppercase letter "J" using the given block types and environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b31 block at position (1, 7). This will form the vertical stem of the letter "J".
2. Place a b31 block at position (4, 7). This will form the horizontal base of the letter "J".
3. Place a b13 block at position (4, 9). This will form the curved part of the letter "J".

The stream of commands would be as follows:

```
ab_drop(3, 7)
ab_drop(1, 7)
ab_drop(1, 8)
ab_drop(1, 9)
ab_drop(3, 7)
ab_drop(1, 7)
ab_drop(1, 8)
ab_drop(1, 9)
ab_drop(3, 7)
ab_drop(1, 9)
```

Please note that the commands may vary slightly depending on the specific rules of the given environment and the orientation of the blocks.
