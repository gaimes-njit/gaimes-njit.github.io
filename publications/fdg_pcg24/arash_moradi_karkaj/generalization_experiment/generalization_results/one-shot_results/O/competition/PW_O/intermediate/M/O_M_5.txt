To generate the letter "M", we can use a combination of the block types b13 and b31. Here is the command sequence to construct the letter "M":

```
ab_drop(b31, 1)
ab_drop(b31, 4)
ab_drop(b31, 8)
ab_drop(b31, 12)
ab_drop(b13, 2)
ab_drop(b13, 14)
ab_drop(b13, 3)
```

By executing these commands in the given environment, the blocks will be placed in such a way that they form the letter "M", while ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
