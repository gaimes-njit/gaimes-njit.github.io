```
ab_drop("b31",1)  # Place first block horizontally at position 1
ab_drop("b13",1)  # Place second block vertically at position 1
ab_drop("b11",1)  # Place third block (square) at position 1
ab_drop("b31",1)  # Place fourth block horizontally at position 1
ab_drop("b13",1)  # Place fifth block vertically at position 1
ab_drop("b11",1)  # Place sixth block (square) at position 1
ab_drop("b13",1)  # Place seventh block vertically at position 1
```

This will generate the uppercase letter 'E' in the Tetris-like environment.
