To generate the letter "E" using the given block types and gravity rules, we need to carefully place each block in the correct position. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to achieve the desired result:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place the second vertical block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place the third vertical block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Place the fourth vertical block at position 2
ab_drop("b31", 3)  # Place the fifth horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop("b11", 3)  # Place the sixth vertical block at position 3
ab_drop("b11", 3)  # Place the seventh vertical block at position 3
```

These commands will create the letter "E" when executed in the given environment.
