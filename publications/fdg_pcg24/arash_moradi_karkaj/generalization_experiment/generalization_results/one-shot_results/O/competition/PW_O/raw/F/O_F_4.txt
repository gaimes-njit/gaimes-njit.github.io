To generate the uppercase letter "F", we can start by using a horizontal straight block (`b31`) to create the top and middle bars of the letter. Then, we can use a vertical straight block (`b13`) to create the vertical bar of the letter.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "F":

```
ab_drop(b31,1)

ab_drop(b31,5)

ab_drop(b13,3)
```

This will place the blocks one by one and create the letter "F" in the Tetris-like environment. Make sure to follow the gravity rules and stay within the allowed boundaries.
