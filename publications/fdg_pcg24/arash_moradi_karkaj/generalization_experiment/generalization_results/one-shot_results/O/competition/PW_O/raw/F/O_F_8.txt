To generate the uppercase letter "F", we can break it down into different segments and place the blocks accordingly. The letter "F" can be represented as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place a horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a square block at position 3
```

This set of commands will generate the uppercase letter "F" with the provided block types in the specified environment.
