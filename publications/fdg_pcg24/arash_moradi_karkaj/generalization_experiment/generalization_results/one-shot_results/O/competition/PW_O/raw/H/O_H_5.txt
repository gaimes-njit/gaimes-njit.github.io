To generate the letter "H", we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical blocks (b13) on the sides and one horizontal block (b31) in the middle. Here's the stream of commands to create the letter "H":

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries.
