```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```

In this example, we first place a horizontal straight block ("b31") at position 1 to form the top part of the letter "I". Then, we place a vertical straight block ("b13") at position 2 to connect the top and bottom parts. We continue this pattern of alternating horizontal and vertical blocks until the letter "I" is complete.
