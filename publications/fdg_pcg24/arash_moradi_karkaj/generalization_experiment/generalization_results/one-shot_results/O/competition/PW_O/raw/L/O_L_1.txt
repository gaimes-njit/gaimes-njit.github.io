```
ab_drop('b11', 1)    // Place a 1x1 block at (1,1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)    // Place a vertical straight block at (1,2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)    // Place a vertical straight block at (1,3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)    // Place a vertical straight block at (1,4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)    // Place a horizontal straight block at (2,1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)    // Place a 1x1 block at (2,2)
```
Explanation: 
This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "L". The first block (1x1) is placed at position (1,1). Then, three vertical straight blocks are placed on top of each other at positions (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4). Finally, a horizontal straight block is placed next to the first block at position (2,1), and another 1x1 block is placed next to it at position (2,2).
