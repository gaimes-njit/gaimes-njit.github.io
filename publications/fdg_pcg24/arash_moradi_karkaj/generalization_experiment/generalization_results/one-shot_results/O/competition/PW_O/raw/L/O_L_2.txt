To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first block type "b31" represents a horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit. We place this block at the position 1 to form the horizontal part of the letter "L".
- The second block type "b13" represents a vertical straight block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units. We place three of these blocks at the position 2 to form the vertical part of the letter "L".

By following these commands, we can generate the uppercase English letter "L" within the allowed space boundaries and ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
