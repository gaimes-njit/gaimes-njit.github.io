As mentioned in the prompt, we need to generate the uppercase English letter "L" using the given block types in the defined environment. 

To create the letter "L", we can use the b11 and b13 block types. 

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "L":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Explanation:

1. We start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 along the width.
2. Next, we place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 1 just below the vertical block.
3. Then, we continue by placing two more 1x1 square blocks (b11) at positions 2 and 3 along the width.

This arrangement will create the uppercase letter "L" when viewed within the defined environment.
