To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block (width 3) at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place the square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the horizontal straight block (width 3) at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Place the square block at position 8
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place the vertical straight block (height 3) at position 9
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Place the square block at position 10
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Place the horizontal straight block (width 3) at position 11
```

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "M" in the Tetris-like environment.
