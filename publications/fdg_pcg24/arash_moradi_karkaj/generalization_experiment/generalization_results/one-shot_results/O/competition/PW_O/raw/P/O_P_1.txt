To generate the uppercase English letter "P", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Let's break down the commands step by step:

1. `ab_drop('b31', 1)` - Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 along the width. This forms the vertical line on the left side of the letter "P".

2. `ab_drop('b31', 1)` - Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. This extends the vertical line further down.

3. `ab_drop('b31', 1)` - Place one more horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. This completes the vertical line on the left side of the letter "P".

4. `ab_drop('b13', 4)` - Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4 along the width. This forms the horizontal line of the letter "P" at the top.

5. `ab_drop('b11', 3)` - Place a square block (b11) at position 3 along the width. This creates the small "bridge" between the vertical and horizontal lines of the letter "P".

6. `ab_drop('b11', 3)` - Place another square block (b11) at position 3. This extends the "bridge".

7. `ab_drop('b11', 3)` - Place one more square block (b11) at position 3. This completes the "bridge" and the letter "P".

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively to construct the letter "P" accurately within the allowed space boundaries.
