Explanation: To create the letter "D", we start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 and 4 along the width. Then, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 4, 5, and 6 along the width. Finally, we place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 6 to complete the letter.
