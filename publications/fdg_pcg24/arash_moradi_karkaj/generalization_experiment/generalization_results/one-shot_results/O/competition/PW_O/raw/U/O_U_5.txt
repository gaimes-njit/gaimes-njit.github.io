To generate the letter "U" in the defined environment, we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop("b31",1)  # Place horizontal block at position 1 (top-left)
ab_drop("b31",2)  # Place horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop("b13",2)  # Place vertical block at position 2 (below the second horizontal block)
ab_drop("b31",4)  # Place horizontal block at position 4 (to the right of the vertical block)
ab_drop("b31",5)  # Place horizontal block at position 5
```

This sequence of commands will create a letter "U" shape, with the blocks aligned in the correct positions to resemble the letter.
