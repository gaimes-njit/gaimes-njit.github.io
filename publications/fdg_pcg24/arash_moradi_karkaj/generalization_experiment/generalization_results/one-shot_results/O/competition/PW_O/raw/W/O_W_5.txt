To generate the uppercase letter "W", we need to place the blocks in a specific arrangement to resemble the shape of the letter. 

Here is the stream of commands that will generate the letter "W":

```
ab_drop(b31, 1)  // Place a horizontal block at x=1 (top of the left side of the "W")
ab_drop(b31, 5)  // Place another horizontal block at x=5 (top of the right side of the "W")
ab_drop(b13, 3)  // Place a vertical block at x=3 (connecting the two horizontal blocks in the middle)
ab_drop(b13, 7)  // Place another vertical block at x=7 (connecting the two horizontal blocks in the middle)
ab_drop(b31, 9)  // Place another horizontal block at x=9 (bottom of the left side of the "W")
ab_drop(b31, 13) // Place another horizontal block at x=13 (bottom of the right side of the "W")
```

These commands will arrange the blocks in the shape of the letter "W" within the given space boundaries.
