As per the provided instructions, the objective is to construct the uppercase English letter "X" using the ab_drop() command and the given block types. We will be working with a grid of 20W and 16H.

To construct the letter "X", we will use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 9
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 10
ab_drop('b31', 13)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 13
ab_drop('b31', 17)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 17
```

This sequence of commands will result in the construction of an uppercase English letter "X" within the allowed space boundaries.

Please note that the provided instructions do not specify any specific size for the constructed letter "X". Therefore, I have assumed a size that reasonably fits within the given grid dimensions while maintaining the stability and accuracy of the letter representation.
