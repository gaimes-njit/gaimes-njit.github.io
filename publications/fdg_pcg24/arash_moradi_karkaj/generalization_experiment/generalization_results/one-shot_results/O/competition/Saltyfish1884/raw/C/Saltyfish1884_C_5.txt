To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "C", while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the b11 block at a suitable position to form the base of the structure. We can choose any slot position between 6 and 13, inclusive, for the center of the b11 block. For example, we can choose slot 10 as the center position:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 10)
   ```

3. Drop the b31 block on top of the base, centered at the same slot position:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

4. Drop another b31 block above the previous one, but shifted to the left by 1 slot:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

5. Drop a b13 block on top of the right side of the base, centered at the same slot position:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 10)
   ```

6. Drop another b13 block above the previous one, but shifted to the left by 1 slot:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

7. The structure will now resemble the character "C". Print the final structure:
   ```python
   for row in structure:
       print(' '.join(row))
   ```

This will output the final structure that resembles the character "C" and meets all the given constraints. Note that the slot positions chosen in steps 2-6 are just one possible solution, and there may be other valid combinations of slot positions that meet the constraints.
