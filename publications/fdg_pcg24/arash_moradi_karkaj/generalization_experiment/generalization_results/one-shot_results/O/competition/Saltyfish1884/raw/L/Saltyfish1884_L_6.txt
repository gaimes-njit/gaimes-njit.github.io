To generate a structure that resembles the character "L" while meeting all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define the function `ab_drop(x, y)` to vertically drop a block onto the structure.
```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
```

3. Place b11 blocks in slots 0 and 1 of the bottom layer to create a solid base.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

4. Place a b31 block on top of the solid base.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with the left side.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

6. The resulting structure should resemble the character "L".

The complete code to generate the structure is as follows:

```python
W = 20  # Width of the map
H = 16  # Height of the map

# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Place b11 blocks in slots 0 and 1 of the bottom layer
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)

# Place a b31 block on top of the solid base
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with the left side
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "L" while meeting all the hard constraints.
