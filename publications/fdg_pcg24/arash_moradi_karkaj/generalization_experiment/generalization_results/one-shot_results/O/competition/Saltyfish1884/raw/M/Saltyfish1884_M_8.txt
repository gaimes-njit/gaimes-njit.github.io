To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.
   ``` python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) to form a solid base at the bottom layer.
   ``` python
   for i in range(W):
       ab_drop('b11', i)  # Drop a b11 block at each slot in the bottom layer
   ```

3. Drop the bottom part of the character "M" using the ab_drop() function.
   - Drop a b31 block in the middle of the base layer to form the center of the "M".
   - Drop two b31 blocks on top of the center block, forming the outer sides of the "M".
   ``` python
   ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop a b31 block in the middle slot of the base layer
   ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Drop a b31 block at the left slot of the base layer
   ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Drop a b31 block at the right slot of the base layer
   ```

4. Drop the top part of the character "M" using the ab_drop() function.
   - Drop a b31 block in the second layer above the base layer, aligned with the center of the base layer.
   - Drop two b31 blocks on top of the center block, forming the top part of the "M".
   ``` python
   ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop a b31 block in the middle slot of the second layer
   ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Drop a b31 block at the left slot of the second layer
   ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Drop a b31 block at the right slot of the second layer
   ```

5. Adjust the placement of the top part of the "M" to meet stability constraints.
   - Drop two b11 blocks on top of the outer sides of the top part of the "M" to support the overhangs.
   ``` python
   ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Drop a b11 block at the left slot of the third layer
   ab_drop('b11', 13)  # Drop a b11 block at the right slot of the third layer
   ```

6. The final structure will resemble the character "M", meeting all hard constraints.
   ``` python
   for row in structure:
       print(' '.join(row))
   ```
