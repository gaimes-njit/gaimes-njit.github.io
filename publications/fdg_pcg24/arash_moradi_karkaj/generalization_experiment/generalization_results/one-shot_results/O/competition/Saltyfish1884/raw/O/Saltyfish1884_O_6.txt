To generate a stable structure resembling the character "O", we need to consider the stability constraints and the shape of the structure.

The character "O" can be represented by a square shape, which means we need to use the b11 block type. We can start by dropping a b11 block at the center of the structure.

Here is the step-by-step process to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty 20x16 grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Drop the b11 block at the center of the structure using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

3. Since stability is a hard constraint, we need to prevent the structure from collapsing. To do this, we can place two b13 blocks on either side of the b11 block, providing a solid base. We can drop the first b13 block at slot 4 and the second b13 block at slot 14:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```

4. Finally, we can drop two b31 blocks on top of the b11 block to complete the square shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "O" and meet all the hard constraints, maintaining stability and preventing boundary intrusion.

Here is the final code:

```
# initialize the structure as an empty 20x16 grid
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# drop the b11 block at the center of the structure
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# drop the first b13 block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 4)

# drop the second b13 block on the right side
ab_drop('b13', 14)

# drop the first b31 block on top of the b11 block
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# drop the second b31 block on top of the b11 block
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

This code will generate a stable structure resembling the character "O".
