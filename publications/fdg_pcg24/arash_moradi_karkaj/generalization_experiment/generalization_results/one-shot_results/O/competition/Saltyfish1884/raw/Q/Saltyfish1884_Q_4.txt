To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully determine the dropping position and order of the blocks.

The first constraint to consider is stability. According to the stability rules, a b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Therefore, we need to start by placing a b13 block on the base.

Next, we need to place a b31 block on top of the b13 block to complete the "Q" shape. To do this, we can use the ab_drop() function with x = 'b31' and y = 9 (assuming the center of the b31 block aligns with slot 9).

Finally, we need to place a b11 block on top of the b31 block to close the loop and complete the "Q" shape. We can use the ab_drop() function with x = 'b11' and y = 9 to achieve this.

Here is an example code snippet to generate the desired structure:

```python
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers

# Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Place a b13 block on the base
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Place a b31 block on top of the b13 block
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

Note that the above code assumes the existence of the ab_drop() function and the definition of the block types (b11, b31, b13) as provided in the problem statement. The exact implementation of the ab_drop() function and the rest of the code depends on your specific programming environment and requirements.
