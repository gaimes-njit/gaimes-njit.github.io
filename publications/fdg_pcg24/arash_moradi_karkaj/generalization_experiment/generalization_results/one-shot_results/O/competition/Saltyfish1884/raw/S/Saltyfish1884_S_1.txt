To generate a stable structure resembling the character "S" while satisfying all the given constraints, we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the b11 block on the base layer to create a foundation.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Placing the b11 block at the center slot (slot 9) on the base layer
```

Step 3: Place the first b13 block on top of the foundation.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Placing the b13 block at slot 8 on the layer above the base layer
```

Step 4: Place the second b13 block on top of the first one to create the center part of the structure.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Placing the b13 block at slot 10 on the same layer as the first b13 block
```

Step 5: Place the b31 block on top of the center part to complete the structure.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Placing the b31 block at the center slot (slot 9) on the layer above the center part
```

Step 6: The final structure will be a stable "S" shape resembling the character "S" while meeting all the hard constraints.

The overall structure will look like this:
```
    |   
    |   
    |   
    |   
    |   
    |   
    |   
    |   
    |  b11
b13 |  b11
b13 |  b13
b31 |  b13
b31 |  b31
```
