To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with size W x H using the provided code.

2. Start by dropping a b11 block at slot 6 using the ab_drop() function. This will serve as the base of the structure.

```
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 5, aligned with the previously dropped b11 block. This will create the first vertical segment of the "S" shape.

```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

4. Drop a b31 block at slot 5, aligned with the previously dropped b13 block. This will create the horizontal segment of the "S" shape.

```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

5. Drop a b13 block at slot 4, aligned with the previously dropped b31 block. This will create the second vertical segment of the "S" shape.

```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

6. Drop a b31 block at slot 4, aligned with the previously dropped b13 block. This will create the second horizontal segment of the "S" shape.

```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

7. Drop a b13 block at slot 3, aligned with the previously dropped b31 block. This will create the third vertical segment of the "S" shape.

```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

8. Drop a b31 block at slot 3, aligned with the previously dropped b13 block. This will create the third horizontal segment of the "S" shape.

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

9. Drop a b13 block at slot 2, aligned with the previously dropped b31 block. This will create the fourth vertical segment of the "S" shape.

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

10. Drop a b31 block at slot 2, aligned with the previously dropped b13 block. This will create the fourth horizontal segment of the "S" shape.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

11. Drop a b11 block at slot 1, aligned with the previously dropped b31 block. This will create the final base segment of the "S" shape.

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "S", meeting all the stability constraints and avoiding boundary intrusion.
