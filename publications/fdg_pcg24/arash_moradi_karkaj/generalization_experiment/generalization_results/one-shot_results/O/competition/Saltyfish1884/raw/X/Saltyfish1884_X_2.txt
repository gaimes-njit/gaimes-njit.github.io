To generate a stable structure resembling the character "X", we need to carefully consider the stability constraints and the shape of the structure. 

First, let's consider stability constraint 5.1. Since we want to create an "X" shape, we need to carefully place the blocks to prevent overhangs and ensure stability. We can start by placing two b31 blocks diagonally to form the two diagonals of the "X". To do this, we can use the ab_drop() function to drop the blocks in the appropriate slots.

Next, let's consider stability constraint 5.2. We need to ensure that the blocks do not intrude on the map's boundary. Since the blocks are of width 3, we can place them in slots 3 to 16 to ensure no boundary intrusion.

Now that we have an idea of the shape and placement of the blocks, we can use the ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks to form the structure that resembles the given character. Here's an example code to accomplish this:

```python
# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the first b31 block diagonally from left to right
ab_drop('b31', 3)

# Drop the second b31 block diagonally from right to left
ab_drop('b31', 16)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

By following these steps and appropriately using the ab_drop() function, you should be able to generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X", while meeting all the hard constraints. Remember to choose the dropping position and order carefully to ensure stability and no boundary intrusion.
