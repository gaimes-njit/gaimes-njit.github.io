To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block to form the first diagonal stroke of the "X". Since we want to place it on the base (layer 0) and ensure stability, we can use the ab_drop() function like this:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```
This will drop a b31 block with its center aligned with slot 8.

3. Next, drop a b13 block on top of the previous b31 block to complete the diagonal stroke of the "X":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```
This will drop a b13 block with its center aligned with slot 8.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create the second diagonal stroke of the "X". Drop a b31 block on the base:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```
Then drop a b13 block on top of it:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

5. Finally, drop a b11 block on layer 1, slots 9 and 10, to form the center of the "X":
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

After executing these steps, the structure should resemble the character "X" while satisfying all the hard constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.

Note: The specific positions of the blocks may vary depending on the order of execution and the starting state of the structure. The above steps provide a general guideline to achieve the desired structure.
