To build the letter "A" using the blocks in the Tetris game, we can break it down into three separate blocks:

1. The base block, which is a row block ("b31") that will form the two horizontal lines of the letter "A".
2. The left diagonal block, which is a column block ("b13") that will form the left side of the diagonal line of the letter "A".
3. The right diagonal block, which is also a column block ("b13") that will form the right side of the diagonal line of the letter "A".

To achieve the best stability and similarity, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the base block in the middle of the bottom row (row index 0) to form the two horizontal lines of the letter "A".
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 2: Place the left diagonal block slightly offset to the left of the center of the grid (left from the previous block) and centered at row index 7 to form the left side of the diagonal line.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

Step 3: Place the right diagonal block slightly offset to the right of the center of the grid (right from the base block) and centered at row index 7 to form the right side of the diagonal line.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

With these steps, the blocks will be well-supported and balanced, ensuring stability. The overall structure will resemble the letter "A".

The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```
