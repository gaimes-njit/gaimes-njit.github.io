To generate the letter "C" in the level, we can break it down into two blocks: a row block (b31) and a column block (b13). Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the row block (b31) at the bottom of the level, centered at x_position=9:
ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Drop the column block (b13) on top of the row block, centered at x_position=9:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

The complete implementation looks like this:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
