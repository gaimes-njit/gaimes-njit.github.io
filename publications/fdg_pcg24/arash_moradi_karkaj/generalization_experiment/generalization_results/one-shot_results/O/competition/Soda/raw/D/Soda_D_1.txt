To create the letter "D" on the grid, we can use a combination of a column block and a row block. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop a column block "b13" at the center of the grid.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

2. Drop a row block "b31" above the column block, aligned with its center.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

3. Drop a row block "b31" above the previous row block, aligned with its center.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

4. Drop a row block "b31" above the previous row block, aligned with its center.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

5. Drop a column block "b13" above the row blocks, aligned with their center.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

6. Drop a row block "b31" above the column block, aligned with its center.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

7. Drop a row block "b31" above the previous row block, aligned with its center.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

8. Drop a row block "b31" above the previous row block, aligned with its center.
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

9. Drop a column block "b13" above the row blocks, aligned with their center.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

10. Drop a column block "b13" above the row blocks, aligned with their center.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

11. Drop a column block "b13" above the row blocks, aligned with their center.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

12. Drop a column block "b13" above the row blocks, aligned with their center.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

13. Drop a column block "b13" above the row blocks, aligned with their center.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

14. Drop a column block "b13" above the row blocks, aligned with their center.
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
