To generate the structure in the shape of the letter "D" in a bottom-to-top fashion while ensuring stability, we can break it down into multiple steps:

Step 1: Create the base of the letter "D"
To create the base of the letter "D," we can use a row block (b31) placed at the bottom center of the grid (x_position = 9). This will create a stable base for the structure.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Step 2: Create the vertical part of the letter "D"
To create the vertical part of the letter "D," we can use a column block (b13) placed directly above the base block at the center left position (x_position = 8). This will create the vertical stroke of the letter.

ab_drop("b13", 8)

Step 3: Create the curved part of the letter "D"
To create the curved part of the letter "D," we need to stack multiple row blocks (b31) on top of each other. We will start from the upper left corner, moving right and slightly upward with each block. The x_position will be incremented by 1 with each iteration to move the blocks to the right.

ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 13)

The complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
