To build a structure that looks like a capital G, we can start by placing a row block (b31) at the bottom to create the base. We will place it at position 8 since the G has a width of 6 cells.

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Next, we will place a column block (b13) on the left side of the base. We will place it at position 5 since the G has a height of 3 cells.

```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

Lastly, we will place another column block (b13) on the right side of the base, aligned with the previous block.

```
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

This will create a structure that looks like a capital G, following the bottom-to-top stacking technique. The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```
