To create the letter "T" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks - two vertical columns and a horizontal bar. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Drop the first vertical column (b13) at x_position = 9. 
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Step 2: Drop the second vertical column (b13) at x_position = 10.
```
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Step 3: Drop the horizontal bar (b31) at x_position = 9.
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

The complete implementation:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
