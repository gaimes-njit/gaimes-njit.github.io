To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "I" and meets all the constraints, we can follow the block-stacking problem techniques and use the `ab_drop()` function. 

First, we need to initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

Next, we need to drop the blocks in a specific order and position to meet the constraints.

To ensure stability, we should start by dropping the bottom blocks first. In this case, we can drop a `b13` block starting at slot 9 (centered horizontally) on the base layer. This will create the central vertical part of the "I" structure.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Next, we can drop two `b31` blocks horizontally on the base layer, starting from slots 7 and 12. This will create the horizontal parts of the "I" structure.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

Finally, we can drop a `b11` block on the top layer, centered horizontally, to complete the "I" structure.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

The final structure will be stable, with no boundary intrusion.

Complete code example:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # code for dropping the blocks

# drop the blocks in the specific order and position to meet the constraints
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
