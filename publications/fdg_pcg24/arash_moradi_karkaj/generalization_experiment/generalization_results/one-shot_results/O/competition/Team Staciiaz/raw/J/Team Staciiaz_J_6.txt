To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "J", we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. We will start by dropping a horizontal block (`b31`) at slot 0, aligning its center at the bottom layer (layer 0) using `ab_drop("b31", 0)`.

Next, we will drop a vertical block (`b13`) at slot 1, aligning its center at the layer above the base using `ab_drop("b13", 1)`.

Finally, we will drop a square block (`b11`) at slot 2, aligning its center at the layer above the base using `ab_drop("b11", 2)`.

The resulting structure will resemble the character "J" and will satisfy the stability constraint since all blocks are properly aligned on top of each other. The boundary intrusion constraint is also satisfied since the blocks do not intrude on the boundary of the map.

Here is the code to generate the stable structure that looks like the character "J":

```
# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

# Function to drop a block
def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # ... implementation details of ab_drop() function ...

# Drop a horizontal block at slot 0, aligning its center at the bottom layer
ab_drop("b31", 0)

# Drop a vertical block at slot 1, aligning its center at the layer above the base
ab_drop("b13", 1)

# Drop a square block at slot 2, aligning its center at the layer above the base
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

After executing this code, the `structure` grid will contain the stable structure that looks like the character "J".
