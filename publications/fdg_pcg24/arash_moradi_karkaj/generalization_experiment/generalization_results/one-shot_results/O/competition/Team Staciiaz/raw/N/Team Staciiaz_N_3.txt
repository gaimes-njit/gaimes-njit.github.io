To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the given constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. First, initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop a b11 block at slot 7 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 7 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

4. Drop a b31 block at slot 4 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

5. Drop a b11 block at slot 0 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

6. Drop a b13 block at slot 0 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

7. Drop a b31 block at slot 16 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b31', 16)
```

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N" and satisfies all the given constraints. The resulting structure will be stored in the `structure` variable.
