To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Q" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop blocks onto the structure following a specific order and position. 

Here's an algorithm that uses the block-stacking problem techniques to construct the "Q" structure while satisfying the constraints:

1. Initialize the structure grid as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the b31 block vertically at slot 5 using the `ab_drop()` function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 5)
   ```

3. Drop the b31 block vertically at slot 14 using the `ab_drop()` function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 14)
   ```

4. Drop the b13 block vertically at slot 9 using the `ab_drop()` function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

5. Drop the b11 block vertically at slot 5 using the `ab_drop()` function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 5)
   ```

6. Drop the b11 block vertically at slot 10 using the `ab_drop()` function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 10)
   ```

7. Drop the b11 block vertically at slot 14 using the `ab_drop()` function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 14)
   ```

8. Drop the b11 block vertically at slot 5 using the `ab_drop()` function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 5)
   ```

9. Drop the b13 block vertically at slot 9 using the `ab_drop()` function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

10. Drop the b31 block vertically at slot 5 using the `ab_drop()` function:
    ```python
    ab_drop('b31', 5)
    ```

11. Drop the b31 block vertically at slot 14 using the `ab_drop()` function:
    ```python
    ab_drop('b31', 14)
    ```

12. The resulting structure will be a stable structure that looks like the character "Q" and meets all the constraints.

By following this algorithm, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q" while satisfying the given constraints.
