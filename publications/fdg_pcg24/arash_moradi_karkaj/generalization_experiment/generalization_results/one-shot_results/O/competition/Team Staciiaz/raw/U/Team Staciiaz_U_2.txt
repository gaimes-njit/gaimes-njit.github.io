To generate a stable structure in the shape of the character "U" while satisfying the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Next, we start by dropping the blocks to form the base of the "U" shape. We can use the `ab_drop()` function to achieve this. We need to consider the stability constraint while placing the blocks. For the base, we can use two horizontal blocks (b31) dropped at slots 4 and 15. We drop these blocks one by one, starting with the block at slot 4:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 15)
```
This should create a horizontal base for the "U" shape structure.

3. Once the base is formed, we can move on to the vertical sides of the "U". To create the vertical sides, we need to use vertical blocks (b13). We can drop these blocks at slots 0 and 19 with the appropriate height to form the sides:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```
These blocks need to be dropped above the base blocks to maintain stability.

4. Finally, we can drop a small square block (b11) in the center of the top of the "U" shape to complete it:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

By following these steps, we should be able to generate a stable structure in the shape of the character "U" that satisfies all the given constraints.
