To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "U" and meets all the constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Define and drop the blocks in the required positions to form the "U" shape:
   ```python
   # Drop the first vertical block (1x3) at slot 3
   ab_drop('b13', 3)

   # Drop the second vertical block (1x3) at slot 16
   ab_drop('b13', 16)

   # Drop the horizontal block (3x1) at slot 4
   ab_drop('b31', 4)

   # Drop the horizontal block (3x1) at slot 15
   ab_drop('b31', 15)

   # Drop the final vertical block (1x3) at slot 6
   ab_drop('b13', 6)
   ```

3. After executing the above code, the `structure` grid will represent the stable structure that looks like the character "U" and meets all the constraints.

Note: The `ab_drop()` function will automatically handle the dropping positions and order based on the provided block types and their respective shapes.
