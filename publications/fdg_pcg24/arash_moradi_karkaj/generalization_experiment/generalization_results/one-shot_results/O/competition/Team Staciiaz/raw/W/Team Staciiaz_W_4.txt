To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" and satisfies all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
   ```
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Define a helper function `check_boundary_intrusion()` to check if a block placement intrudes on the boundary of the map. This function takes the block type, x_position (slot number), and the structure as parameters. It checks if the block extends beyond the boundaries of the map and returns True if it does, indicating an intrusion. Otherwise, it returns False.
   ```python
   def check_boundary_intrusion(block_type, x_position, structure):
       block_shapes = {
           'b11': [(0, 0)],
           'b31': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)],
           'b13': [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (-2, 0)]
       }
       for dx, dy in block_shapes[block_type]:
           if (x_position + dx) < 0 or (x_position + dx) >= W:
               return True
       return False
   ```

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function and a loop to drop the blocks to form the "W" structure. Start by dropping the bottom blocks of the first leg at appropriate slots to ensure stability and no boundary intrusion. Then, drop the blocks for the middle and top sections of the "W" structure, paying attention to stability and boundary intrusion constraints. Adjust the slots and order of block dropping as needed to meet these constraints.

   Example code to generate the "W" structure:
   ```python
   # Drop blocks for the first leg of the "W"
   ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Bottom block of the first leg
   ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Middle block of the first leg
   ab_drop('b11', 0)  # Top block of the first leg

   # Drop blocks for the middle section of the "W"
   ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Bottom block of the middle section
   ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Middle block of the middle section
   ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Top block of the middle section

   # Drop blocks for the second leg of the "W"
   ab_drop('b31', 12)  # Bottom block of the second leg
   ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Middle block of the second leg
   ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Top block of the second leg
   ```

4. Finally, print the resulting structure to verify if it looks like the character "W" and satisfies the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
   ```python
   for row in structure:
       print(''.join(row))
   ```

Remember, the stability and boundary intrusion constraints are crucial in determining the dropping position and order of the blocks. Adjust the slots and order of block dropping as needed to meet these constraints and generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" with no boundary intrusion.
