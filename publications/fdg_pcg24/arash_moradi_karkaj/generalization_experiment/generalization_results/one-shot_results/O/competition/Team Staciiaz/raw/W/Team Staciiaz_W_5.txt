To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" and meets the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner.  Here is an approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at slots 7, 8, and 9, centered at layer 1. This will form the first downward points of the "W".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

3. Drop a b11 block at slots 6 and 10, centered at layer 4. This will form the middle points of the "W".
```python
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

4. Drop a b31 block at slots 4, 5, 11, and 12, centered at layer 7. This will form the top points of the "W".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

5. Finally, drop a b11 block at slots 0 and 19, centered at layer 10. This will form the bottom points of the "W".
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 19)
```

After executing these steps, the structure generated will resemble the character "W" and meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Note: The given constraints do not specify any specific requirements for positioning or order, so the above approach provides one possible solution.
