To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "X" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner.

Here is an approach to generate the structure:

1. Start by dropping a b31 block vertically at slot 9, aligning its center. This will be the central part of the "X" shape. Use the `ab_drop('b31', 9)` function to drop the block.

2. Next, drop a b13 block vertically at slot 7, aligning its center. This will be the left diagonal part of the "X" shape. Use the `ab_drop('b13', 7)` function to drop the block.

3. Drop another b13 block vertically at slot 11, aligning its center. This will be the right diagonal part of the "X" shape. Use the `ab_drop('b13', 11)` function to drop the block.

4. Finally, drop two b11 blocks vertically at slots 7 and 11, aligning their centers. These blocks will fill the gaps created by the diagonal blocks. Use the `ab_drop('b11', 7)` and `ab_drop('b11', 11)` functions to drop the blocks.

By following this approach, the resulting structure will resemble the character "X" and satisfy both the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints.
