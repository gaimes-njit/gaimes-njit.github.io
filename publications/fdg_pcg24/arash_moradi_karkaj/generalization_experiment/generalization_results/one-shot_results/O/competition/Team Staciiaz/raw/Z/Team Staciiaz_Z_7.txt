To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Z" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, the following steps can be followed:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define the positions for dropping the blocks to create the "Z" shape. Considering the constraints, the following positions can be defined:

```python
positions = [
    (0, 0),  # First block (b11) at the leftmost slot
    (1, 0),  # Second block (b11) at the slot next to the first block
    (1, 1),  # Third block (b31) at the same slot as the second block but one layer above
    (3, 0),  # Fourth block (b31) at the slot three positions from the leftmost slot
    (3, 1),  # Fifth block (b31) at the same slot as the fourth block but one layer above
    (5, 0),  # Sixth block (b11) at the slot five positions from the leftmost slot
]
```

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks at the defined positions:

```python
for position in positions:
    x, y = position
    ab_drop('b11', x)
    ab_drop('b31', x)
```

4. After dropping all the blocks, the structure will resemble the character "Z" and should meet the constraints.

Here's the complete code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # Implementation of ab_drop() function

positions = [
    (0, 0),  # First block (b11) at the leftmost slot
    (1, 0),  # Second block (b11) at the slot next to the first block
    (1, 1),  # Third block (b31) at the same slot as the second block but one layer above
    (3, 0),  # Fourth block (b31) at the slot three positions from the leftmost slot
    (3, 1),  # Fifth block (b31) at the same slot as the fourth block but one layer above
    (5, 0),  # Sixth block (b11) at the slot five positions from the leftmost slot
]

for position in positions:
    x, y = position
    ab_drop('b11', x)
    ab_drop('b31', x)
```

Note: The complete implementation of the `ab_drop()` function and the stability check logic are not provided in the given information. These parts need to be implemented to ensure the stability of the structure.
