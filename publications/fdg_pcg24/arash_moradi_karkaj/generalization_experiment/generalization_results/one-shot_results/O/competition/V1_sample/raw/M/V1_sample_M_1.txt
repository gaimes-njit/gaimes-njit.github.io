To generate an "M" structure using the 'ab drop()' function, the following steps can be taken:

1. Start by dropping a b13 block at slot 6 on layer 15 (H), making sure its center is aligned with slot 6.

ab drop(b13, 6, 15)

2. Next, drop a b31 block at slot 6 on layer 14, aligning its center with slot 6.

ab drop(b31, 6, 14)

3. Now, drop another b13 block at slot 6 on layer 13.

ab drop(b13, 6, 13)

4. Repeat steps 1-3 on the right side of the structure to create the second leg of the "M".

5. Finally, drop a b31 block at slot 7 on layer 12, aligning its center with slot 7 to connect the two legs of the "M".

ab drop(b31, 7, 12)

By following these steps and carefully selecting the slots and layers for each block, you can successfully generate a stable structure that resembles the letter "M" using the 'ab drop()' function.
