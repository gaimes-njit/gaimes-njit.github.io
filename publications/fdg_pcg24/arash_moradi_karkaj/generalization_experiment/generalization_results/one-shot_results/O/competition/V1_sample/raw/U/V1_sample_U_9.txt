To generate a stable "U" structure using the 'ab drop()' function, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b13 block centered at slot 9 on layer 15 (top layer) using the 'ab drop()' function.
2. Place a b11 block centered at slots 8, 9, and 10 on layer 14 using the 'ab drop()' function.
3. Place a b13 block centered at slot 9 on layer 13 using the 'ab drop()' function.
4. Continue this pattern downward, alternating between b13 and b11 blocks, until reaching layer 1.
5. Once the bottom of the "U" structure is reached, the stable structure resembling a "U" should be complete. 

By carefully dropping blocks in the correct order and position using the 'ab drop()' function, a stable and visually appealing "U" structure can be achieved.
