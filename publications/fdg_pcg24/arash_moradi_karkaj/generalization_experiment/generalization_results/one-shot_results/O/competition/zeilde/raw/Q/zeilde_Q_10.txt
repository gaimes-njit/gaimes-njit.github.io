Step 2:
In the first row, there are 3 asterisks and 1 space.
In the second row, there are 2 asterisks, 1 space, and 2 asterisks.
In the third row, there is 1 asterisk, 1 space, and 2 asterisks.
In the fourth row, there is 1 asterisk, 1 space, and 2 asterisks.
In the fifth row, there are 3 asterisks and 1 space.

Step 3:
Asterisks are now x and spaces are y.
In the first row, there are 3x and 1y.
In the second row, there are 2x, 1y, and 2x.
In the third row, there is 1x, 1y, and 2x.
In the fourth row, there is 1x, 1y, and 2x.
In the fifth row, there are 3x and 1y.

Step 4:
For each row:
First row: xxxy
Second row: xxxyyx
Third row: xxyyx
Fourth row: xxyyx
Fifth row: xxxy

Step 5:
For each row:
First row: x-1; x-2; x-3; y-4
Second row: x-1; x-2; x-3; y-4; x-5; x-6
Third row: x-1; x-2; y-3; x-4; x-5
Fourth row: x-1; x-2; y-3; x-4; x-5
Fifth row: x-1; x-2; x-3; y-4

Step 6:
