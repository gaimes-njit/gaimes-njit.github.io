To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "B" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use a combination of the ab_drop() function and a systematic approach to dropping the blocks.

First, we need to determine the placement of the blocks to form the shape of the letter "B". We can start by placing the two vertical blocks (b13) on the left and right sides of the structure, with a gap of one slot in the middle. This will form the two vertical lines of the letter "B".

Next, we can place the horizontal block (b31) in the middle layer, aligned with the slot in the middle gap of the vertical blocks. This will form the horizontal line of the letter "B".

To ensure stability, we need to check if each block placement meets the stability constraint. We can do this by simulating the drop of each block and checking if it lands on the base or any previously dropped block before making the actual drop.

Here is a step-by-step plan to generate the structure:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Place the left vertical block (b13).

ab_drop('b13', 2)

Step 3: Place the right vertical block (b13).

ab_drop('b13', 17)

Step 4: Place the horizontal block (b31).

ab_drop('b31', 9)

After executing all the steps, the structure will resemble the uppercase letter "B".

To ensure diversity and avoid repetitive generation, you can introduce randomness or variation in the placement of the blocks while still meeting the stability and shape constraints. For example, you can randomize the position of the vertical blocks within a certain range or vary the gap between them.

Note: The precise coordinates (y values) in the ab_drop() function should be determined based on the specific position of each block in the structure. The values given in the steps above are just examples and may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure being constructed.
