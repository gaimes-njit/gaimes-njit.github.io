Based on the given constraints and the ab_drop() function, we can create a step-by-step approach to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D":

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Start by dropping the b13 block on the bottom layer at slot 3:
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   
3. Drop the b31 block on the 2nd layer, aligned with the center slot of the b13 block:
   ab_drop('b31', 3)
   
4. Drop the b13 block on the 1st layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b31 block:
   ab_drop('b13', 3)
   
5. Drop the b11 block on the 1st layer, aligned with the center slot of the b13 block previously stacked:
   ab_drop('b11', 3)
   
6. Drop the b11 block on the 2nd layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b31 block:
   ab_drop('b11', 5)
   
7. Drop the b11 block on the 1st layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b31 block:
   ab_drop('b11', 5)
   
8. Drop the b11 block on the 1st layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b31 block:
   ab_drop('b11', 1)
   
9. Drop the b11 block on the 2nd layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b31 block:
   ab_drop('b11', 1)
   
10. Drop the b13 block on the 1st layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b11 block:
    ab_drop('b13', 1)
    
11. Drop the b13 block on the 1st layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b11 block:
    ab_drop('b13', 9)
    
12. Drop the b11 block on the 2nd layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b31 block:
    ab_drop('b11', 9)
    
13. Drop the b11 block on the 1st layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b31 block:
    ab_drop('b11', 13)
    
14. Drop the b11 block on the 2nd layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b31 block:
    ab_drop('b11', 13)
    
15. Drop the b13 block on the 1st layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b11 block:
    ab_drop('b13', 13)
    
16. Drop the b13 block on the 1st layer, aligned with the center slot of the previously dropped b11 block:
    ab_drop('b13', 17)

By following these steps and using the ab_drop() function, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "D".
