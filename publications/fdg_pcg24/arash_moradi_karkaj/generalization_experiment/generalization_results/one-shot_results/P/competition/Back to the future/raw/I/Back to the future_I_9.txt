To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "I" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided function `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) up to the top layer (layer 15).

3. Place the base of the "I" structure using the function `ab_drop('b31', 9)` to drop a horizontal block (b31) with its center aligned with slot 9.

4. Check the stability of the structure after each block placement using the function `is_stable(layer)`, which checks if the blocks in the given layer and the layers above it have proper support. If the structure is not stable, adjust the placement of the previous blocks until it is stable.

5. Place the vertical blocks (b13) to form the middle and top parts of the "I" structure. Use the function `ab_drop('b13', y)` to drop a vertical block (b13) with its center aligned with the specified slot `y` on the corresponding layer.

6. Again, check the stability of the structure after each block placement.

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the entire "I" structure is formed.

8. Finally, ensure that the generated content is diverse and not always the same by randomizing the slot positions for dropping the blocks.

Here is a sample code that implements the above steps:

```python
import random

W = 20 # Number of slots
H = 16 # Number of layers

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Function to drop a block vertically
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    
def is_stable(layer):
    # Function to check the stability of the structure
    for i in range(layer, H):
        for j in range(W):
            if structure[i][j] != ' ' and (i == 0 or structure[i-1][j] == ' '):
                return False
    return True

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)] # Initialize the structure

# Place the base of the "I" structure
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Check stability
while not is_stable(1):
    structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
    ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Place the vertical blocks
for layer in range(1, 14, 2):
    slots = [i for i in range(1, W-1)]
    random.shuffle(slots)
    for slot in slots:
        if is_stable(layer+1):
            ab_drop('b13', slot)

# Check stability
while not is_stable(14):
    structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
    ab_drop('b31', 9)
    for layer in range(1, 14, 2):
        slots = [i for i in range(1, W-1)]
        random.shuffle(slots)
        for slot in slots:
            if is_stable(layer+1):
                ab_drop('b13', slot)

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Note: The code above assumes that there is a function `is_stable(layer)` to check the stability of the structure, but the exact implementation of this function is not provided. You will need to implement the stability check based on the given constraints and requirements of the block-stacking problem.
