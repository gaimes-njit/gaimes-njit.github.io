To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "J" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function and follow the block-stacking problem techniques. Here is an example solution:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Begin by dropping the b13 block to create the vertical part of the "J". Place it at slot 2, aligned with the center of the structure:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```
This will drop the b13 block from the top layer to the base layer, aligned with slot 2.

3. Next, drop the b31 block to create the horizontal part of the "J". Place it at slot 5, aligned with the right side of the vertical b13 block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```
This will drop the b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with slot 5.

4. To further stabilize the structure, drop another b11 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with slot 5:
```
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
This will drop the b11 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with slot 5.

5. Finally, drop another b11 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with slot 4:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```
This will drop the b11 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with slot 4.

After following these steps, the resulting structure should resemble the uppercase character "J" and meet all the hard constraints. Remember to perform stability checks before each call to `ab_drop()` to ensure the overall structure remains stable during the generation process.
