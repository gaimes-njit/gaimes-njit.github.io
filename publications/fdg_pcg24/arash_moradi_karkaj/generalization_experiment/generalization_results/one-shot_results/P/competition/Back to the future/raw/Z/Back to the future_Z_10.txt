To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Z" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the center slot of the bottom layer (layer 0). This will provide a stable base for the rest of the structure:
```
ab_drop('b31', (W//2)-1)
```
Coordinates: (0, 8) to (0, 10)

3. Drop a b11 block on top of the b31 block, centered on the top slot of the left side of the b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b11', (W//2)-2)
```
Coordinates: (1, 7)

4. Drop a b31 block on top of the previous b31 block, aligned with its right side:
```
ab_drop('b31', (W//2)+1)
```
Coordinates: (1, 11) to (1, 13)

5. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous b31 block, centered on the top slot of the right side of the b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b11', (W//2)+2)
```
Coordinates: (2, 12)

6. Drop a b13 block on top of the previous b31 and b11 blocks, aligned with their tops:
```
ab_drop('b13', (W//2)-1)
```
Coordinates: (2, 8) to (4, 8)

7. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous b13 block, centered on the slot below its center:
```
ab_drop('b11', (W//2))
```
Coordinates: (3, 9)

8. With these steps, the structure should have a stable "Z" shape similar to the uppercase letter "Z" and meet all the hard constraints. The specific coordinates and block types used are mentioned above.

Note: The above steps assume the center slot (W//2) is an integer value, i.e., the number of slots (W) is even.
