To generate a structure resembling the uppercase letter "B" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully plan the sequence of block drops.

Here is the series of ab_drop() function calls:

ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the left vertical part
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the bottom horizontal part
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Place the connecting dot
ab_drop('b13', 13) # Place the top horizontal part
ab_drop('b31', 18) # Place the right vertical part

This sequence of block drops forms a stable structure resembling the letter "B". Please note that the block positions and order are crucial to ensure stability and resemblance to the desired letter.

Feel free to adjust the block positions and order based on the given constraints to achieve different variations of the letter "B".
