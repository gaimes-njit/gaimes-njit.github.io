To form the letter "D" using the given props and the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the field:
```python
field = [[0]*20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Drop the b31 brick to form the straight vertical part of the "D":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```
This will occupy the cells (5, 0), (6, 0), and (7, 0).

3. Drop the b13 brick to form the curved part of the "D":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
This will occupy the cells (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3).

The final structure representing the letter "D" will occupy the following cells:
(5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3).

Here's the complete code:

```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Implementation of ab_drop function
    
# 1. Initialize the field
field = [[0]*20 for _ in range(16)]

# 2. Drop the b31 brick to form the straight vertical part of the "D"
ab_drop('b31', 5)

# 3. Drop the b13 brick to form the curved part of the "D"
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Print the field to visualize the final structure
for row in field:
    print(row)
```

You can test and visualize the final structure by executing the code above.
