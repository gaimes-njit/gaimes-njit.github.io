To form the shape resembling the letter "N", we can use the following steps:

1. Initialize the field with empty cells.
2. Drop a b13 brick at x_position = 0 using the ab_drop('b13', 0) function. This will occupy cells (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2).
3. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 4 using the ab_drop('b31', 4) function. This will occupy cells (4, 0), (5, 0), and (6, 0).
4. Drop a b13 brick at x_position = 9 using the ab_drop('b13', 9) function. This will occupy cells (9, 0), (9, 1), and (9, 2).
5. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 14 using the ab_drop('b31', 14) function. This will occupy cells (14, 0), (15, 0), and (16, 0).

The resulting structure will resemble the letter "N" in the field.

Here is the code:

```python
# Initialize the field with empty cells
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Function to drop a brick on the field
def ab_drop(x, y):
    if x == 'b31':
        width = 3
        height = 1
    elif x == 'b13':
        width = 1
        height = 3
    elif x == 'b11':
        width = 1
        height = 1
    
    # Check if the brick's occupied cells will exceed the boundaries of the field
    if (y + width - 1) > 19 or (width > 1 and (y + width) > 19):
        # Brick will collide with the boundaries, return without modifying the field
        return
    
    # Iterate through each cell from top to bottom
    for i in range(15, -1, -1):
        # Check if any cell in the current row is already occupied
        if any(field[i][y:y+width]):
            # Brick will collide with existing occupied cells, return without modifying the field
            return
        
        # Check if the brick has landed on the ground
        if i == 0:
            # Brick has landed, occupy the cells
            for j in range(y, y+width):
                field[i][j] = 1
            return

# Drop the bricks to form the "N" shape
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 14)

# Print the resulting field
for row in field:
    print(row)
```

The output will be:

```
