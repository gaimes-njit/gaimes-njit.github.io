To form a shape resembling the letter "O" using the available bricks, we can start by placing a b13 brick vertically at the middle of the field, followed by a b31 brick horizontally above it. This will create the top half of the "O" shape. Then, we can place another b31 brick horizontally below the b13 brick to complete the bottom half of the "O" shape.

The code snippet to generate this structure can be as follows:

```python
# Map initialization
map_cells = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check stability of bricks
def check_stability():
    for y in range(15, 0, -1):
        for x in range(19):
            if map_cells[y][x] == 1:
                if (map_cells[y-1][x] == 0 and map_cells[y-1][x+1] == 1) or \
                   (map_cells[y-1][x] == 1 and map_cells[y-1][x+1] == 0):
                    return False
    return True

# Function to place bricks on the field
def ab_drop(x, y):
    if x == 'b31':
        if y < 0 or y+2 >= 20:
            return
        for i in range(y, y+3):
            if map_cells[0][i] == 1:
                return
        for i in range(y, y+3):
            map_cells[0][i] = 1
    elif x == 'b13':
        if y < 0 or y >= 20:
            return
        for i in range(y, y+3):
            if map_cells[0][i] == 1:
                return
        for i in range(y, y+3):
            map_cells[0][i] = 1

# Generate the required structure
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Check stability and print the result
if check_stability():
    for row in map_cells:
        print(row)
else:
    print("The structure is unstable.")
```

This code will print the map_cells after placing the bricks. If the structure is stable, it will be printed as a matrix with 1s representing occupied cells and 0s representing empty cells. If the structure is unstable, it will print "The structure is unstable."
