To create the structure exactly like "G", we can use the following code:

First, we need to drop a 3*1 block (b31) starting from position (5, 8):
ab_drop('b31', 5)

Next, we need to drop a 1*3 block (b13) starting from position (5, 8):
ab_drop('b13', 6)

Finally, we need to drop a 1*1 block (b11) starting from position (7, 10):
ab_drop('b11', 8)

This will create a "G" shape within the 20*16 box block, starting from position (0, 0).
