To create the structure of the letter "I" inside a 20x16 block, we can use the ab_drop() command with different block types and positions. Here's how you can do it:

1. Drop a b31 block at position (9, 7):
ab_drop('b31', 9)

2. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 8):
ab_drop('b13', 9)

3. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 9):
ab_drop('b13', 9)

4. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 10):
ab_drop('b13', 9)

5. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 11):
ab_drop('b13', 9)

Now you should have a structure resembling the letter "I" inside the 20x16 block.
