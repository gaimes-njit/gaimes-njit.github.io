To create a structure exactly like "U" inside a 20*16 block, we can use the following commands:

ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Create the left vertical line of the "U"
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Create the top horizontal line of the "U"
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Create the right vertical line of the "U"

This will result in a "U" shape structure inside the 20*16 block.
