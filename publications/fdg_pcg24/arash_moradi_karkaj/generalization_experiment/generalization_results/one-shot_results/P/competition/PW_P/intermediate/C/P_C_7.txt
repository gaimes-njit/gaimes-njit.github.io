To generate the uppercase English letter "C", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b31', 1)               # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 4)               # Place the vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)               # Place the vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 6)               # Place the vertical straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 7)               # Place the vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 1)               # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 4)               # Place the vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)               # Place the vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 6)               # Place the vertical straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 7)               # Place the vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 1)               # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1

This will generate the letter "C" in the Tetris-like environment with the given block types and gravity rules.
