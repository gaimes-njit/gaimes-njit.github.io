L:foundation ab_drop('b13',1) ab_drop('b13',2) ab_drop('b31',3) ab_drop('b11',1) ab_drop('b11',3)

Explanation: To create the uppercase letter "L", we start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at positions 1 and 2. Then, we place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 to complete the base of the "L". Finally, we add two square blocks (b11) at positions 1 and 3 to complete the vertical part of the "L".
