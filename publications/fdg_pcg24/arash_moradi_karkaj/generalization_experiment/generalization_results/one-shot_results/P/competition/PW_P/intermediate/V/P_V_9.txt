To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b31',1)  # Places a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Places a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',4)  # Places a horizontal straight block at position 4

This set of commands will create a stable structure resembling the letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries.
