To generate the uppercase English letter "A", we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width to complete the top part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Place a square block (b11) at positions 1 and 3 along the width to create the diagonal lines of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

4. Finally, place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) at position 2 along the width to complete the bottom part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The complete set of commands to generate the letter "A" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
