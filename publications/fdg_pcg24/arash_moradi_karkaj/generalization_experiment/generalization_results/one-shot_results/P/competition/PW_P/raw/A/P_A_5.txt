To generate the uppercase English letter "A", the following sequence of ab_drop() commands can be used:

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place another square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2

This sequence of commands will create the letter "A" using the block types and gravity rules specified in the prompt.
