To generate the letter "B" using the command ab_drop(), the following stream of commands can be used:

ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place the vertical block at position 1

ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place the vertical block at position 2

ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place the horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 1)    # Place the square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 3)    # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place the horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place the horizontal block at position 2

These commands will generate the letter "B" within the allowed space boundaries using the block types mentioned.
