To generate the uppercase letter "B", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place the second vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2 again (for the middle part of 'B')
ab_drop('b11',1)   # Place the 1x1 square block at position 1 (for the curved part of 'B')
ab_drop('b11',3)   # Place the 1x1 square block at position 3 (for the curved part of 'B')
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2 (for the bottom part of 'B')
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2 again (for the bottom part of 'B')
```

This series of commands will construct the uppercase letter "B" in the given Tetris-like environment while maintaining structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
