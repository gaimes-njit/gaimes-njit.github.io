To construct the uppercase letter "C", we can use a combination of the block types b31 and b13. Here is one possible sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',4)  # Place the horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place the vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',7)  # Place the horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop('b31',10) # Place the horizontal block at position 10
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "C" with the specified block types in the defined environment.
