To generate the uppercase letter "D" using the given command and block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at positions 1 and 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical straight blocks, centered at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Place a square block (b11) on top of the horizontal straight block, at position 1 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

4. Place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) on top of the square block, centered at position 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The complete sequence of commands to generate the letter "D" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
