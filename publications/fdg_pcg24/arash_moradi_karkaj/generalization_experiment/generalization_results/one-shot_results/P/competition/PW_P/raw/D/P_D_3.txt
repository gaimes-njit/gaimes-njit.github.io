To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at positions 1 and 2 along the width.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks at position 2.
3. Place a square block (b11) at position 1, aligned with the bottom of the vertical blocks.
4. Place another square block (b11) at position 3, aligned with the bottom of the vertical blocks.
5. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the vertical blocks, aligned with position 2.
6. Finally, place two more horizontal straight blocks (b31) on top of each other at position 2.

The stream of commands to generate the letter "D" would be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)      # Place vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)      # Place vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)      # Place horizontal block on top
ab_drop('b11', 1)      # Place square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 3)      # Place square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)      # Place horizontal block on top
ab_drop('b31', 2)      # Place horizontal block on top
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "D" in the defined environment while ensuring stability and fitting within the allowed space boundaries.
