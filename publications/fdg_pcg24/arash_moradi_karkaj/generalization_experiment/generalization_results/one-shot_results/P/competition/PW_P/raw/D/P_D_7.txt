To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we can follow these steps:

1. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at positions (1, 1) and (1, 2) to form the left vertical line of the letter D:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at positions (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 2) to form the top horizontal line of the letter D:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Place two square blocks (b11) at positions (2, 1) and (2, 3) to complete the letter D:
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```
