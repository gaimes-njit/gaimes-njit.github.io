To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we need to create a vertical straight block followed by a horizontal straight block, forming the shape of the letter.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter D:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1) # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2) # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3) # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1) # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2) # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3) # Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4) # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "D" in the Tetris-like environment.
