To generate the uppercase English letter "E," you can use the following series of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
top                # Move to the top row
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place a square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place another square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 1
```

This series of commands will create the letter "E" within the allowed space using the given block types and gravity rules.
