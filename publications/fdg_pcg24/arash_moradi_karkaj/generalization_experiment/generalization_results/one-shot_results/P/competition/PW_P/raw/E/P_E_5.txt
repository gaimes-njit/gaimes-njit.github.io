To generate the uppercase letter "E" using the given block types in the specified environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Place the two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the left side to form the two vertical strokes of the "E":
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

2. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) between the two vertical strokes to form the top horizontal stroke of the "E":
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

3. Place two square blocks (b11) on the top right corner to complete the bottom part of the top horizontal stroke:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 1)
   ab_drop('b11', 3)
   ```

4. Place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) on top of each other to form the middle horizontal stroke of the "E":
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "E" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
