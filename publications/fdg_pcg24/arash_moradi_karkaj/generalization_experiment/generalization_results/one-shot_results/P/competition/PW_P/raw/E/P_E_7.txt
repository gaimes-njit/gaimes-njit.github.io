To generate the uppercase English letter "E" using the given block types and gravity rules, you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place 1x1 square block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place 1x1 square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "E" as follows:

```
******
*     
*     
*****
*     
*     
******
```
