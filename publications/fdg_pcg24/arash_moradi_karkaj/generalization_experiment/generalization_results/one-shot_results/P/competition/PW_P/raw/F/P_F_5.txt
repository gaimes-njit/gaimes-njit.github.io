To generate the uppercase English letter "F" using the given block types in the defined environment, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)      # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)      # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)      # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 1)      # Place the square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 3)      # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)      # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)      # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "F" with accurate representation and fitting within the allowed space boundaries.
