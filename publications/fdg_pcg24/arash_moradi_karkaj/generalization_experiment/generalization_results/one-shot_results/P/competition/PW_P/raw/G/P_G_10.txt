To generate the uppercase letter "G", we can use a combination of the block types b13 and b31.

Here are the steps to generate the letter "G":

1. Place two vertical blocks (b13) side by side at positions 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 2 to form the top part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Add two small square blocks (b11) at positions 1 and 3 to complete the top part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

4. Place two horizontal blocks (b31) at position 2 to form the middle and bottom parts of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "G" would look like this:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
