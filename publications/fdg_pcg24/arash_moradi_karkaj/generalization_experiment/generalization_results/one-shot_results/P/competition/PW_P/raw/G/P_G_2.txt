To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can follow the following pattern:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1) # Drop a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2) # Drop another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3) # Drop another vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 4) # Drop another vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 1) # Drop a horizontal straight block at position 1 (top part of the G)
ab_drop('b31', 2) # Drop another horizontal straight block at position 2 (top part of the G)
ab_drop('b31', 3) # Drop another horizontal straight block at position 3 (top part of the G)
ab_drop('b11', 4) # Drop a square block at position 4 (middle part of the G)
ab_drop('b11', 5) # Drop another square block at position 5 (middle part of the G)
ab_drop('b31', 4) # Drop a horizontal straight block at position 4 (bottom part of the G)
ab_drop('b31', 5) # Drop another horizontal straight block at position 5 (bottom part of the G)
ab_drop('b31', 6) # Drop another horizontal straight block at position 6 (bottom part of the G)
```

This sequence of commands will create a "G" shape in the defined environment while ensuring stacking and stability according to the gravity rules.
