To generate the letter "G" using the mentioned command and block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at positions 1 and 2:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to form the top part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 to form the middle part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

4. Place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) at position 2 to form the bottom part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

After executing these commands consecutively, you should have successfully generated the letter "G" within the allowed space boundaries.
