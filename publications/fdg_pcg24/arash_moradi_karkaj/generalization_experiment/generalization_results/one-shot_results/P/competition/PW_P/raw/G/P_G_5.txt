To create the uppercase English letter "G", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating the foundation of the letter. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at positions 1 and 2 along the width. This forms the vertical stem of the letter.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width, on top of the vertical stem. This forms the top part of the letter.
3. Place a square block (b11) at position 1 along the width, on top of the horizontal block. This is the top-left corner of the letter.
4. Place another square block (b11) at position 3 along the width, on top of the horizontal block. This is the top-right corner of the letter.
5. Place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) next to each other at position 2 along the width, on top of the horizontal block. These complete the middle part of the letter.

The stream of commands would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
