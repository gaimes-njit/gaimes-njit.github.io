To generate the uppercase English letter "H" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Place the square block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "H" in the given environment while ensuring stacking and stability according to the gravity rules.
