To generate the letter "H" using the given block types and command, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 along the width:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 2 along the width, on top of the two vertical blocks:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Place two square blocks (b11) at positions 1 and 3 along the width, on top of the horizontal block:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

4. Finally, place two horizontal blocks (b31) at positions 2 and 2 along the width, on top of the square blocks:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These commands will create an "H" shape within the specified boundaries.
