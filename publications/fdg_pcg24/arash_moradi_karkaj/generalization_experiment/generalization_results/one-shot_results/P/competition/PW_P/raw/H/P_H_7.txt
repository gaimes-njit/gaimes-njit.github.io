To generate the uppercase English letter "H", we can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 along the width.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 along the width, just above the two vertical straight blocks.
3. Place two square blocks (b11) at positions 1 and 3 along the width, above the horizontal straight block.

The stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "H" would be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',3)
```
