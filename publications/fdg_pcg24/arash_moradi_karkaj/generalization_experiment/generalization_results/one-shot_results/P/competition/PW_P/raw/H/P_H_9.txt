To generate the uppercase English letter "H", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place the middle square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 6)   # Place the third horizontal block at position 6
ab_drop('b13', 7)   # Place the second vertical block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 9)   # Place the fourth horizontal block at position 9
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries.
