To generate the uppercase English letter "I" using the given block types, we need to construct a vertical straight block (b13) with a width of 1 unit and a height of 5 units.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "I":
```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

Starting from position 1, we drop the vertical straight block (b13) five times to construct the letter "I". Each time, we place the block at position 1 along the width.

Note: The letter "I" only requires the vertical straight block (b13) to be repeated.
