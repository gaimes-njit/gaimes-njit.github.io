To generate the uppercase letter "I", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```

Explanation:
- The letter "I" consists of a vertical straight block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 5 units.
- We can place five blocks of type 'b31' consecutively at position 1 along the width to form the letter "I".
