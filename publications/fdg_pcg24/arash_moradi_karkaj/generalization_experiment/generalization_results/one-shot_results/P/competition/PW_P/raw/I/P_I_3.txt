To create the uppercase letter "I", we can use the block types b13 and b31. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "I":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will first create three vertical blocks to form the vertical line of the letter "I". Then, a horizontal block is placed on top to complete the letter shape.
