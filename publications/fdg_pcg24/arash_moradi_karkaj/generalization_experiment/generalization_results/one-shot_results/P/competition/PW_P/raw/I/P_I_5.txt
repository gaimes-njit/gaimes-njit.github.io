To generate the uppercase letter "I", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the first vertical straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the second vertical straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the third vertical straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the fourth vertical straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the fifth vertical straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the sixth vertical straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the seventh vertical straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block above the vertical blocks
```

After executing these commands, the grid will resemble the uppercase letter "I" with the specified block types and sizes in the defined environment.
