To generate the uppercase English letter "J," we need to follow these steps using the given block types:

1. Place the vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 and 2 along the width.
2. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, aligned with the top of the vertical straight blocks.
3. Place the square block (b11) at position 1, aligned with the bottom-left corner of the vertical straight blocks.
4. Place another square block (b11) at position 3, aligned with the bottom-right corner of the vertical straight blocks.
