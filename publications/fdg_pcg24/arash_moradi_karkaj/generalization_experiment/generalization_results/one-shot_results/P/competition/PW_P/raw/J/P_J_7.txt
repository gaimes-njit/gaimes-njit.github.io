To generate the uppercase letter "J", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place the 1x1 square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place the 1x1 square block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place the 1x1 square block at position 5
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "J" within the allowed space, following the defined gravity rules.
