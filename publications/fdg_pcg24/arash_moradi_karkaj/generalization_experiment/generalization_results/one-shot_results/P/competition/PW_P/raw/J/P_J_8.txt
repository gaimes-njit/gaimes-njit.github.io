To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we need to first create the vertical stem and then add the horizontal base. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Creating the vertical stem
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Adding the horizontal base
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

This sequence of commands will generate the letter "J" in the defined environment while ensuring stability with respect to the gravity rules. Make sure to include the commands consecutively between three backticks (```) when submitting your response.
