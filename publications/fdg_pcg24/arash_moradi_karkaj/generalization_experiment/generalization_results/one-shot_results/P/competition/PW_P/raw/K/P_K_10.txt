To create the uppercase letter "K", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place another square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place one more horizontal straight block at position 2

Please note that this sequence of commands assumes the existence of the block types 'b11', 'b13', and 'b31' as specified in the prompt. Make sure to adjust the function names and arguments according to your programming language and environment.
