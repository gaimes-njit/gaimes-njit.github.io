Here is the solution to generate the uppercase English letter "K":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # horizontal straight block at position 2, connecting the vertical blocks
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # horizontal straight block at position 2, connecting the vertical blocks
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # horizontal straight block at position 2, connecting the vertical blocks
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # vertical straight block at position 3, extending the right side of the letter
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # vertical straight block at position 4, extending the right side of the letter
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # vertical straight block at position 5, extending the right side of the letter
```

By executing these commands consecutively in the given environment, the capital letter "K" will be generated.
