To generate the uppercase English letter "K", you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 3)    # Place square block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)    # Place horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)    # Place horizontal block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will generate the letter "K" in the defined environment.
