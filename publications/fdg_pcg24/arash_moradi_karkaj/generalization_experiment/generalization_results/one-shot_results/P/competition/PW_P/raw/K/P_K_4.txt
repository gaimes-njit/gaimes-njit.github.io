To generate the uppercase letter "K", we can use a combination of the block types b13 and b31. Here is the stream of commands to create the letter "K":

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

This sequence of commands will first create the left vertical line of the "K" using three b13 blocks. Then, a horizontal line is created using two b31 blocks. Finally, the right vertical line is completed using two additional b13 blocks.
