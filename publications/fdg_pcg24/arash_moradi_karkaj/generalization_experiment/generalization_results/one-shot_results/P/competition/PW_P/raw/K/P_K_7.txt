To generate the uppercase English letter "K", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place horizontal straight block at X position 1
ab_drop('b11',1)   # Place square block at X position 1
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place horizontal straight block at X position 2
ab_drop('b11',2)   # Place square block at X position 2
ab_drop('b31',3)   # Place horizontal straight block at X position 3
ab_drop('b31',2)   # Place horizontal straight block at X position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place vertical straight block at X position 3
ab_drop('b31',1)   # Place horizontal straight block at X position 1
ab_drop('b11',1)   # Place square block at X position 1
ab_drop('b13',3)   # Place vertical straight block at X position 3
```

This series of commands will construct the letter "K" in the defined environment while ensuring stability and abiding by the gravity rules.
