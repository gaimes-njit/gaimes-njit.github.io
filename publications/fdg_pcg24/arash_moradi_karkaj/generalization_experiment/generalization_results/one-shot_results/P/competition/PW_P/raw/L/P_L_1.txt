To create the uppercase letter "L", you can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b13',1)  // Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)  // Place a square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11',3)  // Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31',2)  // Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will generate the letter "L" in the Tetris-like environment. Remember to place each block one by one, ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
