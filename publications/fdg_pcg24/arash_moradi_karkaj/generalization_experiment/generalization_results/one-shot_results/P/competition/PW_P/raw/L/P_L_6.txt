To generate the uppercase letter "L", you can use the following stream of commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will build the letter "L" in the given environment while following the stacking and stability rules.
