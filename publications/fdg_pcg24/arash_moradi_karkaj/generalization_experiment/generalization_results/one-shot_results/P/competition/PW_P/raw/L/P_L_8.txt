To generate the uppercase letter "L", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place a vertical straight block on position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place another vertical straight block on position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)    # Place a third vertical straight block on position 3
ab_drop('b31', 3)    # Place a horizontal straight block on position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "L" in the Tetris-like environment, taking into account the 2D gravity rules.
