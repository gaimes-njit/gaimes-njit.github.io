To generate the uppercase English letter "L", you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will create the letter "L" in the defined environment, following the gravity rules and ensuring structural stability.
