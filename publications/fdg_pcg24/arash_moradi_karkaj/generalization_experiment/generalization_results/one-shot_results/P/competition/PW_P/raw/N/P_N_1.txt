To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) side by side at positions 1 and 2 along the width.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks, centered at position 2.
3. Place a square block (b11) at position 1, on top of the horizontal block.
4. Place another square block (b11) at position 3, on top of the horizontal block.

Putting it all together, the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "N" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b11',3)
```
