To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Place horizontal straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b11', 8)   # Place square block at position 8
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 11
ab_drop('b13', 14)  # Place vertical straight block at position 14
ab_drop('b31', 17)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 17
ab_drop('b31', 18)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 18
```

This series of commands will construct the letter "N" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
