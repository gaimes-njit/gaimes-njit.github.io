To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) starting from the leftmost position:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the second vertical block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

3. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) on top of the horizontal block, aligned with the left side:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 1)
   ```

4. Place another 1x1 square block (b11) on top of the horizontal block, aligned with the right side:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 3)
   ```

5. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the horizontal block, aligned with the center:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

6. Place the last horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the previous block, aligned with the center:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "N" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
