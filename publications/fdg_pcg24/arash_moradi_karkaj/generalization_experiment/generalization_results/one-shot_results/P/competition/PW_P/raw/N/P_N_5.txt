To generate the uppercase English letter "N", the following stream of commands can be used:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',4)  # Place vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31',7)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 7
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "N" in the given environment, while ensuring structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
