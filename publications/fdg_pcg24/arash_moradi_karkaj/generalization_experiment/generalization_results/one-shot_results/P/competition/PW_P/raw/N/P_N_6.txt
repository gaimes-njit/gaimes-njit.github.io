To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b31', 6)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 6
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "N" within the allowed space boundaries and following the gravity rules.
