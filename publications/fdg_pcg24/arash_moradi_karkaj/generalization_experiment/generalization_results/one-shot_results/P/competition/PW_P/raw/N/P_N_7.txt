To generate the uppercase letter "N", we will use a combination of the block types mentioned: b13 (vertical straight block) and b31 (horizontal straight block).

Here are the ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "N":
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)        # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)        # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)        # Place the horizontal block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 4)        # Place the vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)        # Place the vertical block at position 5
```

When executed consecutively, these commands will create the desired uppercase letter "N" within the allowed space.
