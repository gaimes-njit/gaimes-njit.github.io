To generate the uppercase English letter "O", use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "O" by stacking and placing the blocks in the defined environment.
