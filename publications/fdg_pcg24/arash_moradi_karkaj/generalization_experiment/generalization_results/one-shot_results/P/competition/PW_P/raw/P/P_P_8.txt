Here is a stream of commands that will construct the uppercase English letter "P" using the given block types in the defined environment:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

These commands will first create the vertical stem of the letter "P" using two 'b13' blocks. Then, a 'b31' block will be placed horizontally to form the top of the letter. Finally, two 'b11' blocks will fill in the gaps in the top of the letter.
