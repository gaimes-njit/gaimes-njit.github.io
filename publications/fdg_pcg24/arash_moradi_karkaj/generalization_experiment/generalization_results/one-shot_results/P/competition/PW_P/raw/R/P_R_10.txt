To create the uppercase letter "R", we can start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) side by side to form the left side of the letter. Then, we can add a horizontal straight block (b31) below the two vertical blocks to create the baseline of the letter. Finally, we can place two square blocks (b11) on the right side of the horizontal block to complete the letter.

Here is the stream of commands to create the letter "R":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b11',5)
ab_drop('b11',7)
```

Please note that the numbers in the x position of the ab_drop commands represent the width position of each block, and they should be adjusted accordingly to fit within the boundaries of the allowed space.
