To generate the uppercase English letter "S", we can break it down into three parts: the top horizontal line, the middle diagonal line, and the bottom horizontal line. We will use the provided block types to construct each part.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "S":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first block of the top horizontal line
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the second block of the top horizontal line
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the third block of the top horizontal line
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place an additional block at the end of the top horizontal line

ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the first block of the middle diagonal line
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place the second block of the middle diagonal line
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the third block of the middle diagonal line

ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place the first block of the bottom horizontal line
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the second block of the bottom horizontal line
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the third block of the bottom horizontal line
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place an additional block at the end of the bottom horizontal line
```

Ensure that you follow the gravity rules and place the blocks consecutively to create the letter "S" accurately.
