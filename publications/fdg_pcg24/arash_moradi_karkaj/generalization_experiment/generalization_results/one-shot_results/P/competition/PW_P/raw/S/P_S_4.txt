To generate the uppercase letter "S", we can break it down into three parts: the top curve, the middle vertical line, and the bottom curve. We will use the block types b31 and b13 to create these parts.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "S":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)   // Create the top curve of the letter
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',3)   // Create the middle vertical line of the letter
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',1)   // Create the bottom curve of the letter
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

By executing these commands consecutively, the capital letter "S" will be formed in the Tetris-like environment, following the specified gravity rules.
