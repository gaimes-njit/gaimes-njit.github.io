To generate the uppercase English letter "S" using the provided block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at positions 1 and 2 along the width:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to form the top part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Place two 1x1 square blocks (b11) at positions 1 and 3 to complete the middle part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

4. Place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) at position 2 to form the bottom part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "S" would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Please note that the commands should be executed consecutively and in the given order to ensure the correct placement and stability of the blocks.
