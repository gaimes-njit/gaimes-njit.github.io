Here is an example stream of commands to generate the uppercase English letter "T":

ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2

This sequence of commands will create the letter "T" in the 2D gravity environment.
