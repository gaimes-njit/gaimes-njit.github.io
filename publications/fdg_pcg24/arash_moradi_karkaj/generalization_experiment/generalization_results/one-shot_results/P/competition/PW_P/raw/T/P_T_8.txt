To generate the uppercase letter "T", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Explanation:
- Start by placing three vertical blocks (b13) next to each other in positions 1, 2, and 3 along the width.
- Then, place a horizontal block (b31) on top of the middle block (position 2).

This arrangement will form the shape of the uppercase letter "T" within the allowed space boundaries.
