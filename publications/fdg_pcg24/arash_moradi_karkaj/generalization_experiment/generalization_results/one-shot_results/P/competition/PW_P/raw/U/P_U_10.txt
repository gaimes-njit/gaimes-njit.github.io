Target Letter: U

Stream of commands to generate U:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Place horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place square block at position 5
```

Explanation:
- Start by placing two vertical blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 to form the left side of the U.
- Then, place two horizontal blocks (b31) at positions 1 and 3 to form the top of the U.
- Finally, place three square blocks (b11) at positions 1, 3, and 5 to form the bottom of the U.
