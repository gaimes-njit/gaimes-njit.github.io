To generate the uppercase English letter "U," we can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) side by side at the beginning of the grid:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 2)
   ```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks, aligning its middle unit with the middle unit of the two vertical blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

3. Place two 1x1 square blocks (b11) on each side of the horizontal block, just below the vertical blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 1)
   ab_drop('b11', 3)
   ```

4. Place two more horizontal straight blocks (b31) on top of the previous horizontal block, just below the top boundary of the grid:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

Overall, the stream of commands to generate the uppercase "U" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
