To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   // Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   // Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)   // Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)   // Place the second horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)   // Place the second vertical straight block at position 5
```

This sequence of commands will stack the blocks in a way that resembles the uppercase letter "V" within the allowed space and following the 2D gravity rules.
