To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11',2)  # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
```

These commands will create the letter "V" in the Tetris-like environment.
