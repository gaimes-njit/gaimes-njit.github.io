To generate the uppercase English letter "W", you can use the following stream of commands:

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31',1)  // Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)  // Place the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',4)  // Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b13',5)  // Place the second vertical block at position 5
ab_drop('b31',7)  // Place the third horizontal block at position 7
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "W" in the defined environment, following the stacking and stability rules.
