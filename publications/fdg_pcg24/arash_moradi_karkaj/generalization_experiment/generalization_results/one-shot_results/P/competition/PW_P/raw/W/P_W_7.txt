To create the uppercase English letter "W" using the given block types and environment, we can follow the following set of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place the horizontal straight block right below the first block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Place the second vertical straight block right below the horizontal block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)  // Place another horizontal straight block right below the second vertical block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 5)  // Place the third vertical straight block right below the second horizontal block at position 5
```

These set of commands will create the uppercase "W" letter by stacking the blocks in the correct positions, ensuring stability according to the gravity rules.
