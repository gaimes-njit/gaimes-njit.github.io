To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Place the square block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
```

This stream of commands will construct the uppercase English letter "Z" within the allowed space boundaries. The blocks are placed in the correct order and positions to resemble the shape of the letter.
