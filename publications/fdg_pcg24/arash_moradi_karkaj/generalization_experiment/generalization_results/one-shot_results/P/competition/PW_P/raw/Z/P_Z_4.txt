To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", we need to use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
```

These commands will construct the uppercase letter "Z" in the defined environment.
