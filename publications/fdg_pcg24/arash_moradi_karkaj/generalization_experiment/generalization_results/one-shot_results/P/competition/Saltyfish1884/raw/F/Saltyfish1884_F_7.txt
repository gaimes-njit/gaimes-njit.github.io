To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "F", while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.

2. Start by dropping the b13 block at slot 1, layer 14 using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
This will create the vertical stroke of the "F".

3. Next, drop the b31 block at slot 1, layer 12 using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will create the horizontal stroke of the "F" below the vertical stroke.

4. Drop the b11 block at slot 0, layer 15 using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```
This will add a base to support the structure.

5. Drop the b11 block at slot 2, layer 15 using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```
This will add support to the right side of the structure.

6. Finally, drop the b11 block at slot 2, layer 13 using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```
This will add support to the right side of the horizontal stroke.

The overall structure should now resemble the character "F" and meet all the stability and boundary constraints.

Note: The specific slot and layer numbers mentioned above are just examples. You may need to adjust them based on the desired placement and alignment of the blocks to create a stable structure that resembles the character "F".
