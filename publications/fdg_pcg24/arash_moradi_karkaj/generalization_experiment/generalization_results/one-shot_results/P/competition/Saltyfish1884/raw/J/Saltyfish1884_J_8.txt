To generate a stable structure resembling the character "J" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Based on the stability rules, we need to start by placing a b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks). We can do this by using the `ab_drop()` function with the block type x as b31 and the desired aligning slot y as the center slot of the structure.

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Now, we need to place two b13 blocks vertically above the b31 block to form the "J" shape. We can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the b13 blocks at the appropriate slots to achieve this. According to the stability rules, we should drop the blocks as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.

```
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

4. Lastly, we can add the top part of the "J" shape by placing a b11 block above the right b13 block. Again, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to accomplish this.

```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

After executing these steps, the `structure` grid will represent a stable structure resembling the character "J".

Here's an example of what the resulting structure might look like:

```
structure = [[' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
             [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
             [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
             [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
             [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
             [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ',
