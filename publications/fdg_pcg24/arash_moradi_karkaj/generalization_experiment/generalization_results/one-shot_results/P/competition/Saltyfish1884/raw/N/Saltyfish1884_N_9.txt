To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Start by dropping a b11 block at the bottom layer and slot 2:
```
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Step 3: Drop a b31 block on top of the b11 block at slot 1, making sure it is placed on a solid base:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 4: Drop another b11 block on top of the b31 block at slot 3:
```
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Step 5: Drop a b13 block on top of the b11 block at slot 4, completing the left side of the "N":
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Step 6: Drop a b11 block on top of the b31 block at slot 6:
```
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```

Step 7: Drop a b13 block on top of the b11 block at slot 7, completing the right side of the "N":
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

Step 8: The final structure will resemble the character "N" while meeting all the hard constraints.

Note: Make sure to adjust the slot positions and block types according to the desired structure, considering the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
