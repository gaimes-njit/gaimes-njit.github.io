To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "P" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Place the base of the "P":
ab_drop('b11', 9)

3. Place the vertical part of the "P":
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)

4. Place the horizontal part of the "P":
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)

This arrangement will form a stable structure that resembles the character "P". The blocks are placed in such a way that they meet the stability constraint and do not intrude on the boundary of the map. The result can be displayed using the print() function, iterating over the structure and joining the elements of each row:

for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))

This will give the final structure as a visualization of the character "P".
