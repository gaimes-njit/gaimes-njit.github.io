To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability rules and constraints mentioned above. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with width W and height H using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b31 block aligned at the center slot of the base layer (layer 0) using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop("b31", int(W/2))
```

3. Place two b13 blocks on top of the b31 block at adjacent slots using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop("b13", int(W/2)-1)
ab_drop("b13", int(W/2)+1)
```

4. Place a b31 block above the previous b31 block and spanning three slots using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop("b31", int(W/2))
```

5. Place a b13 block on top of the leftmost slot of the previous b31 block using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop("b13", int(W/2)-1)
```

6. Place a b11 block above the previous b31 block and spanning one slot using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop("b11", int(W/2))
```

7. Place a b31 block on top of the previous b11 block and spanning three slots using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop("b31", int(W/2))
```

8. Place a b11 block above the previous b31 block and spanning one slot using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop("b11", int(W/2))
```

9. Place a b13 block on top of the rightmost slot of the previous b31 block using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop("b13", int(W/2)+1)
```

10. Place a b31 block above the previous b13 block and spanning three slots using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop("b31", int(W/2))
```

11. Place a b31 block on top of the previous b31 block and spanning three slots using the ab_drop() function:
```
ab_drop("b31", int(W/2))
```

The above steps will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q" while satisfying the given constraints. The specific arrangement of blocks may vary, but the overall shape and stability should be similar to the example in part 6.
