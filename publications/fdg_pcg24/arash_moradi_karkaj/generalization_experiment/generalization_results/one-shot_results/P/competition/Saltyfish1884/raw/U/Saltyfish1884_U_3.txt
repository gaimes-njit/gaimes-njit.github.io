To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "U" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the b31 block to form the bottom part of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop the b31 block centered at slot 9
```

Step 3: Drop the b13 blocks to form the left and right sides of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Drop the first b13 block centered at slot 2
ab_drop('b13', 16)  # Drop the second b13 block centered at slot 16
```

Step 4: Drop the b31 block on top of the previous b31 block to form the top part of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop the b31 block centered at slot 9, on top of the previous b31 block
```

Step 5: Adjust the structure to meet the stability constraint:
```python
# Move the b13 blocks one layer higher to reduce the risk of collapsing
structure[1][2] = ' '  # Remove the first b13 block from layer 1 and slot 2
structure[1][16] = ' '  # Remove the second b13 block from layer 1 and slot 16
structure[0][2] = 'b13'  # Place the first b13 block on layer 0 and slot 2
structure[0][16] = 'b13'  # Place the second b13 block on layer 0 and slot 16
```

Step 6: Print the final structure:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The above steps ensure that a stable structure resembling the character "U" is generated while meeting all the given requirements.
