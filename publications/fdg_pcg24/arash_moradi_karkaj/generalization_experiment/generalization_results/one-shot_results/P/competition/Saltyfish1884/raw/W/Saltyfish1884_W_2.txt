To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "W" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the drop positions for each block type considering the stability constraints. Based on the structure of the character "W", we can determine the drop positions as follows:

```
b31: Drop at slots (8, 9, 10)
b13: Drop at slots (4, 5, 6)
b31: Drop at slots (12, 13, 14)
```

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks at the determined positions. For example:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

4. Finally, visualize the resulting structure to verify if it resembles the character "W". You can print the structure using the following code:

```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The resulting structure should resemble the character "W", meeting all the given stability and boundary constraints.
