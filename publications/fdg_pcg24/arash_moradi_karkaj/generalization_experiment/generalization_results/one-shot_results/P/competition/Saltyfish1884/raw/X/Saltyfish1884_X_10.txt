To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X", we need to carefully consider the constraints mentioned.

First, let's analyze the stability constraint. According to the stability rules:
1) A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
2) Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
3) Structure should not be separated.

Based on these rules, we can determine the shape of the structure to resemble the character "X". 

Structure shape:
- Place two b31 blocks vertically, one on top of the other, at the center of the structure. This will form the center of the "X".
- Place two b11 blocks diagonally, on the left and right sides of the center b31 blocks, forming the diagonal arms of the "X".

Now, let's use the ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks to form the structure.

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the bottom b31 block at the center
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the top b31 block at the center
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the left b11 block diagonally
ab_drop('b11', 7)

# Drop the right b11 block diagonally
ab_drop('b11', 11)

The final structure, formed by the dropped blocks, will resemble the character "X" and meet the stability constraints.

Here is an example of the resulting structure:
