First, we need to build the base of the letter "C". The base will be made up of a row block and two column blocks. We'll place the row block in the center of the grid and the two column blocks on either side of it to form a symmetrical base. 

Next, we'll add the top of the letter "C". This will be made up of a column block on the left side and a column block on the right side. We'll place both column blocks just above the base, ensuring that they are vertically aligned with the column blocks in the base. 

Finally, we'll add the center of the letter "C". This will be made up of a row block and a column block. We'll place the row block just above the center of the base, and the column block just to the right of the row block. 

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "C" (TARGET).

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place row block (base)
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Place left column block (base)
ab_drop("b13", 14) # Place right column block (base)
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Place left column block (top)
ab_drop("b13", 14) # Place right column block (top)
ab_drop("b31", 10) # Place row block (center)
ab_drop("b13", 11) # Place column block (center)
```
