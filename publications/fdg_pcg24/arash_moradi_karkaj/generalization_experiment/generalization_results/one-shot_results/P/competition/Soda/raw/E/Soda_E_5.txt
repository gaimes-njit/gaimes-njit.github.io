First, we need to create the base of the letter E. We can use a row block "b31" to do this. We will center it at position 6.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

Next, we need to create the top of the letter E. We can use a column block "b13" to do this. We will center it at position 6.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

Finally, we need to create the middle bar of the letter E. We can use a row block "b31" to do this. We will center it at position 6.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

The complete implementation is:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```
