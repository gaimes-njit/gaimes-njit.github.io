To create a structure that looks like the letter "N" in Tetris, we can build the structure block by block in a bottom-to-top fashion. 

First, we need to create the base of the "N" shape. We can use a row block (b31) for this. Since the width of the grid is 20 columns, we can place the row block at position 9 to have it centered. 

Next, we can add the two vertical bars of the "N" shape. We can use column blocks (b13) for this. We need to make sure they are placed at appropriate positions so that they align with the ends of the row block. We can place the left vertical bar at position 7 and the right vertical bar at position 11.

Finally, we can add a square block (b11) on top of the row block to complete the "N" shape. We need to place it at position 9 to align with the center of the row block.

The complete implementation to create an "N" shape structure in Tetris would be:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Note: The code is not indented as per the instruction, but indentation should be added when using this code in an actual programming environment.
