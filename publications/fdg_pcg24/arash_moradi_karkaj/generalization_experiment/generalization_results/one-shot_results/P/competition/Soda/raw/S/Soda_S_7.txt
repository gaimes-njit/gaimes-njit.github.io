To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "S" in the level, we can break it down into two blocks - the top horizontal bar and the bottom diagonal bar. 

To create the top horizontal bar, we can use the "b31" block type, which represents a row block of size 3 * 1. We will drop this block at x_position = 4 to center it in the middle of the level.

Next, we will create the bottom diagonal bar. We can use the "b13" block type, which represents a column block of size 1 * 3. We will drop this block at x_position = 5 to center it in the middle-right of the level.

Here is the complete implementation to create the "S" structure:

```
# Drop the top horizontal bar at x_position = 4
ab_drop("b31", 4)

# Drop the bottom diagonal bar at x_position = 5
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

This implementation will create a stable structure in the shape of the capital letter "S" in the level.
