To generate a structure that looks like the capital character "X" on the grid, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the base blocks of the "X" shape on the bottom row to ensure stability.
2. Place the remaining blocks to complete the "X" shape while maintaining stability.

Here's the complete implementation to generate the "X" shape on the grid:

```
# Place the base blocks of the "X" shape
ab_drop("b13", 4)   # Place a column block at x_position=4
ab_drop("b13", 15)  # Place a column block at x_position=15

# Place the diagonal blocks of the "X" shape
ab_drop("b31", 7)   # Place a row block at x_position=7
ab_drop("b31", 12)  # Place a row block at x_position=12
```

This implementation places two column blocks at x_position=4 and x_position=15 to form the base of the "X" shape. Then, it places two row blocks at x_position=7 and x_position=12 to form the diagonal lines of the "X" shape.

The resulting structure will resemble the letter "X" and will be stable, satisfying the stability and similarity requirements.
