To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "X" and meets all the constraints, the `ab_drop()` function can be used to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here's how it can be done step-by-step:

1. Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 9 in layer 0 to create the middle part of the character "X".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

2. Drop the vertical block b13 at slot 10 in layer 8 to create the top right part of the character "X".

```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

3. Drop the vertical block b13 at slot 10 in layer 7 to create the bottom right part of the character "X".

```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

4. Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 9 in layer 15 to create the top part of the character "X".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

5. Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 9 in layer 1 to create the bottom part of the character "X".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

The resulting structure will be a stable structure that looks like the character "X" and meets all the constraints.
