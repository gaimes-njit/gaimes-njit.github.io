Here is an example code snippet to generate a stable structure resembling the letter "I" using the ‘ab drop()’ function:

```python
from aerial_control import ab

# Define the structure of the "I" using block types
structure = [
    "b13",  # Top part of the "I"
    "b13",  # Middle part of the "I"
    "b13",  # Bottom part of the "I"
    "b31"   # Base of the "I"
]

# Set the dropping position and order to form the "I" shape
for layer, block_type in enumerate(structure):
    ab.drop(block_type, y=10, layer=layer)
``` 

In this code snippet, the structure of the "I" is defined using block types in the `structure` list. The `ab.drop()` function is called for each block in the structure to drop it at the appropriate layer with its center at slot 10. By setting the dropping position and order correctly, a stable structure resembling the letter "I" will be generated using the ‘ab drop()’ function.
