4. Implementation
To generate the "L" structure, we will start by dropping a b31 block from layer 15 (top layer) with its center at slot 8. This block will represent the horizontal part of the "L".

Next, we will drop a b13 block from layer 12 with its center at slot 8. This block will represent the vertical part of the "L".

Finally, we will drop a b11 block from layer 0 with its center at slot 8. This block will serve as the base of the "L" structure.

By following these steps and carefully controlling the drop positions and order, we can create a stable structure that looks like the letter "L".
