4. Instructions

To generate a stable structure that looks like the "Z" shape, follow these steps:

Step 1: Drop a b31 block from layer H with its center at slot 3.
ab drop(b31, 3, H)

Step 2: Drop a b13 block from layer H-1 with its center at slot 3.
ab drop(b13, 3, H-1)

Step 3: Drop a b31 block from layer H-2 with its center at slot 2.
ab drop(b31, 2, H-2)

Step 4: Drop a b13 block from layer H-3 with its center at slot 2.
ab drop(b13, 2, H-3)

Step 5: Drop a b31 block from layer H-4 with its center at slot 1.
ab drop(b31, 1, H-4)

Step 6: Drop a b11 block from layer H-1 with its center at slot 1.
ab drop(b11, 1, H-1)

Step 7: Drop a b11 block from layer H-2 with its center at slot 1.
ab drop(b11, 1, H-2)

By following these instructions and dropping the blocks in the specified order and position, you should be able to create a stable structure that resembles the "Z" shape.
