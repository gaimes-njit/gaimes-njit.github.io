To create a structure resembling "P" using the `ab_drop()` function, the following approach can be taken:

1. Start by initializing the map structure using the given code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block (`b13`) at the bottom left slot (slot 0) to form the vertical part of the "P":
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Drop the second block (`b11`) at the bottom left slot (slot 0) to form the horizontal part of the "P":
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

4. Drop the third block (`b11`) at the slot next to the previous block (slot 1) to complete the horizontal part of the "P":
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

5. The resulting structure will now resemble the letter "P". Output the `ab_drop()` calls within a code block:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```
