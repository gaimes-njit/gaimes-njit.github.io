To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "G" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. To create the base of the "G", we need to drop two b31 blocks next to each other. We can do this by calling `ab_drop('b31', 4)` and `ab_drop('b31', 5)`. This will create a stable base for the structure.

3. To create the vertical part of the "G", we need to drop a b13 block on top of the previous b31 blocks. We can do this by calling `ab_drop('b13', 4)`. This block will be supported by the b31 blocks below it.

4. To create the horizontal part of the "G", we need to drop a b31 block on top of the vertical part. We can do this by calling `ab_drop('b31', 5)`. This block will be supported by the b31 and b13 blocks below it.

Here is an example of the code to generate the "G" structure:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Create the base
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)

# Create the vertical part
ab_drop('b13', 4)

# Create the horizontal part
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

After running this code, the `structure` grid will contain the dropped blocks representing the uppercase character "G", meeting all the hard constraints.
