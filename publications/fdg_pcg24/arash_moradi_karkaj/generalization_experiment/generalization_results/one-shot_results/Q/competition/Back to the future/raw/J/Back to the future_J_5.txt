To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "J" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.
2. Define the function ab_drop(x, y) that drops a block from layer H such that its center is at slot y. Update the structure grid accordingly.
3. Drop the b11 block at the bottom-left corner of the structure to form the base.
4. Drop a b31 block above the base to form the long vertical part of the "J" character.
5. Drop a b11 block on top of the previous b31 block to create the short horizontal part of the "J" character.
6. Drop a b11 block to form the ascender part of the "J" character.
7. Drop a b13 block on top of the previous b11 block to complete the overall shape of the "J" character.

The final structure should resemble the uppercase letter "J" and meet all the hard constraints, including stability and no boundary intrusion.
