To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "K" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code snippet:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Place the base of the "K" structure by dropping a b31 block at the center slot:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
   ```

3. Place the vertical part of the "K" structure by dropping a b13 block above the base, aligned with its center:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', W // 2)
   ```

4. Place the horizontal part of the "K" structure by dropping two b31 blocks above the vertical part, aligned with their centers:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', W // 2 - 1)  # left horizontal block
   ab_drop('b31', W // 2 + 1)  # right horizontal block
   ```

5. Modify the code for the ab_drop() function to include stability checks before each drop. You can check if the position below the drop position is empty or occupied. If it is occupied, the block can be dropped at the current position. Otherwise, it needs support from previous blocks. Here's an updated version of the ab_drop() function:
   ```python
   def ab_drop(x, y):
       # x is the block type, y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned

       # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
       drop_pos = (H-1, y)
       
       # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
       while drop_pos[0] > 0:
           if structure[drop_pos[0]-1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
               break
           drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
       
       # place the block on the structure
       structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
   ```

6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 above to place multiple "K" structures in different positions to ensure diversity.

7. Perform stability checks after each drop to ensure the entire structure remains stable.

8. Repeat steps 2-7 multiple times to generate a diverse and stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "K".
