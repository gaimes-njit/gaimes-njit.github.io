To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Q" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps using the `ab_drop()` function:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided initialization code.
2. Drop a b13 block at slot 9 and layer 0 to form the vertical part of the "Q". This will be the initial support for the other blocks.
3. Drop a b31 block at slot 7 and layer 3 to form the horizontal part of the "Q". This block will rest on top of the b13 block and provide stability.
4. Drop a b11 block at slot 7 and layer 6 to form the upper part of the "Q". This block will rest on top of the b31 block and complete the shape.
5. Drop a b31 block at slot 9 and layer 6 to add stability to the upper part of the "Q". This block will rest on top of the b11 block.
6. Drop a b13 block at slot 8 and layer 9 to add support to the lower part of the "Q". This block will rest on top of the b31 block and connect to the b13 block at the base.
7. Drop a b11 block at slot 9 and layer 12 to add the final piece to the lower part of the "Q". This block will rest on top of the b13 block and complete the shape.

The resulting structure will resemble the uppercase letter "Q" and meet all the hard constraints.
