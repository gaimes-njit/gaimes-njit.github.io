To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "V", we will use the `ab_drop()` function and follow the given constraints. Here is the algorithm to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]` command.

2. To create the bottom part of the "V" shape, drop a b13 block from slot 9 using the `ab_drop('b13', 9)` command.

3. To create the middle part of the "V" shape, drop a b31 block from slot 8 using the `ab_drop('b31', 8)` command.

4. To create the top part of the "V" shape, drop a b13 block from slot 7 using the `ab_drop('b13', 7)` command.

5. The structure is now complete and resembles the uppercase character "V".

Here is the implementation of the algorithm in Python:

```
W = 20  # map's width
H = 16  # map's height

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type, y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned

    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)

    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break

    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    print(f"Block {x} dropped at position {drop_pos}")

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the bottom part of the "V" shape
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Drop the middle part of the "V" shape
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Drop the top part of the "V" shape
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

Running this code will generate the stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "V". The `ab_drop()` function is responsible for ensuring that each block is dropped in a stable position based on the given constraints.
