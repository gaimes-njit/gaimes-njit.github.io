To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "W" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code.
2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer up.
3. Use the ab_drop() function to drop blocks in a way that ensures stability and meets the given constraints.
4. Iterate through the layers and slots to determine the positions to drop the blocks.
5. For stability, we need to make sure that each block has proper support from the lower layers or previously dropped blocks.
6. For the shape to resemble the "W" character, we can strategically drop b11, b13, and b31 blocks in a pattern that replicates the shape.
7. To add diversity and avoid repetition, we can introduce randomization in block placement or use algorithms like genetic algorithms to generate different structures.
8. Make sure to keep track of the coordinates of each ab_drop() call and list them accordingly.

Here is an example implementation of the ab_drop() function:

```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type, y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned

    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)

    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break

    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
```

Using this ab_drop() function and following the steps mentioned above, you can generate a stable structure resembling the uppercase letter "W" while satisfying the given constraints.
