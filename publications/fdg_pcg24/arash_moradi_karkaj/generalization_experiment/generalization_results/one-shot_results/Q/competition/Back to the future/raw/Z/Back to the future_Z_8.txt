Solution:

To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Z" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid as an empty WxH grid using the given code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Implement a function to check the stability of the structure after each drop. This function will iterate through the structure grid and check if any blocks are in a position where they have unsupported space below them. If such a block is found, the function will return False, indicating instability. Otherwise, the function will return True, indicating stability.

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in the desired pattern. To create a "Z" shape, we can start by dropping a horizontal b31 block centered at slot 7 on layer 0. The coordinates of this drop would be (0, 7).

4. After each drop, use the stability check function to ensure that the structure remains stable. If the check fails, adjust the drop position or modify the existing structure to maintain stability.

5. Continue dropping blocks in the desired pattern to form the uppercase "Z". This includes dropping a vertical b13 block centered at slot 6 on layer 1, followed by another horizontal b31 block centered at slot 5 on layer 2. The coordinates for these drops would be (1, 6) and (2, 5) respectively.

6. Repeat the process for the remaining part of the "Z" shape, dropping a vertical b13 block centered at slot 4 on layer 2, followed by a horizontal b31 block centered at slot 3 on layer 3, and finally a vertical b13 block centered at slot 4 on layer 4. The coordinates for these drops would be (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 4) respectively.

7. Lastly, check if the generated structure resembles the uppercase letter "Z" by comparing it to the desired pattern. The pattern of the "Z" can be represented using an ASCII art format.

8. Repeat the process multiple times, varying the starting positions and orders of the drops, to ensure diversity in the generated structures.

Below is an example implementation of the ab_drop() function and the stability check function:

```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def stability_check():
    for i in range(H-1, 0, -1):
        for j in range(W):
            if structure[i][j] != ' ' and structure[i-1][j] == ' ':
                return False
    return True

def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    return drop_pos

# Example usage to form the letter "Z"
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)

# Check stability
is_stable = stability_check()
print("Is structure stable after drops? ", is_stable)

# Compare generated structure to the desired pattern
pattern = [
    "####################",
    "                     ",
    "      ###            ",
    "   ###               ",
    "                    #",
    "####################"
]

for i in range(H):
    row = ''.join(structure[i])
    print(row)
    if row != pattern[i]:
        print("Generated structure does not match the desired pattern.")

```

By following these steps, we can generate stable structures resembling the uppercase character "Z" while meeting all the hard constraints. The stability checks, as well as the comparison with the desired pattern, ensure that the generated structures are stable and conform to the desired shape.
