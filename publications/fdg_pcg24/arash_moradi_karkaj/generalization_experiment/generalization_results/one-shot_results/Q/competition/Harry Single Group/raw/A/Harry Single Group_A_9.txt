To form the shape resembling the letter "A", we can use the following steps:

1. First, we need to initialize an empty field. We can represent the field using a 2D list with 16 rows and 20 columns. Each cell can be represented by a "." to indicate it is empty.

```
field = [['.' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Next, we can start placing the bricks on the field using the `ab_drop(x, y)` function. 

To form the two diagonal arms of the "A", we can use two vertical bricks `b13`. We can place them starting from the bottom edges, slightly offset from the center.

```
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the left arm starting at x_position 3
ab_drop('b13', 13)  # Place the right arm starting at x_position 13
```

3. To form the middle part, we can use a horizontal brick `b31`. We can place it such that its bottom edge is aligned with the bottom edges of the diagonal arms.

```
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Place the middle part starting at x_position 6
```

Now, if we visualize the field, it should resemble the letter "A":

```
...............b31........
...............b31........
...............b31........
.....b13..................
.....b13..................
.....b13..................
..........................
..........................
..........................
..........................
..........................
..........................
..........................
..........................
..........................
..........................
..........................
..........................
..........................
```

Please note that the visualization above may not be accurate due to the limitation of text formatting. The "." character represents an empty cell, "b13" represents the vertical bricks, and "b31" represents the horizontal brick.
