To form the shape resembling the letter "E" using the available bricks and the ab_drop function, we need to strategically place the bricks in a stable manner. Here's a step-by-step approach to accomplish this:

1. Initialize the field by creating an empty 2D grid with dimensions 20x16.

```python
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Start by placing the b31 brick vertically in the leftmost position of the bottom row to form the vertical stroke of the "E".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Now, place the b13 brick horizontally in the bottom row, starting from x_position 1 to form the center horizontal stroke of the "E".

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Finally, place the b31 brick vertically in the rightmost position of the bottom row to form the right vertical stroke of the "E".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 18)
```

By following these steps, the required structure resembling the letter "E" will be generated on the field. Make sure to handle stability and boundary collision constraints while placing the bricks.
