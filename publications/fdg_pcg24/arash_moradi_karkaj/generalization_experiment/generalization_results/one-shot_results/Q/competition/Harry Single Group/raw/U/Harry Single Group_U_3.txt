To generate the shape resembling the letter "U" using the available props and the ab_drop(x, y) function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the map to represent the field:
```
map = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Place the first b31 brick on the ground at the center of the field:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will occupy the cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).

3. Place the second b31 brick above the first one:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will occupy the cells (8, 1), (9, 1), and (10, 1).

4. Place the b13 brick on top of the two b31 bricks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
This will occupy the cells (9, 2), (9, 3), and (9, 4).

Now, the shape resembling the letter "U" has been generated while satisfying the stability and boundary collision requirements.
