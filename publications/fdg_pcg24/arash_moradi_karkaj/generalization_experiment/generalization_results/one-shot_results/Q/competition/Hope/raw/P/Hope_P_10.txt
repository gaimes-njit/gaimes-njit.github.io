To create the structure exactly like "P" using the given block types, you can use the following ab_drop commands:

1. Place the first vertical block (b31) at position (0, 0):
   ab_drop('b31', 0)

2. Place the second vertical block (b31) at position (0, 1):
   ab_drop('b31', 0)

3. Place the third vertical block (b31) at position (0, 2):
   ab_drop('b31', 0)

4. Place the fourth horizontal block (b13) at position (1, 1):
   ab_drop('b13', 1)

5. Place the fifth vertical block (b31) at position (2, 0):
   ab_drop('b31', 2)

You can continue this pattern to create the rest of the structure.
