To generate uppercase letter "G" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a b13 block at position (1, 1) using the ab_drop(b13, 1) command. This will form the vertical part of the letter.

2. Next, place a b31 block at position (1, 2) using the ab_drop(b31, 1) command. This will form the top horizontal part of the letter.

3. Place another b13 block at position (3, 3) using the ab_drop(b13, 3) command. This will form the bottom vertical part of the letter.

4. Finally, place a b11 block at position (2, 4) using the ab_drop(b11, 2) command. This will complete the letter "G".

The stream of commands to generate uppercase letter "G" would look like this:
```
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b31, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 3)
ab_drop(b11, 2)
