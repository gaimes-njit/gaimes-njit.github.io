To generate the uppercase letter "A", we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical straight blocks (b13) for the sides of the letter, and one horizontal straight block (b31) for the middle part. 

Here are the commands to generate the letter "A":

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the left side of the letter
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the middle part of the letter
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Place the right side of the letter
```

Make sure to enter the commands consecutively and within the defined environment to accurately generate the letter "A".
