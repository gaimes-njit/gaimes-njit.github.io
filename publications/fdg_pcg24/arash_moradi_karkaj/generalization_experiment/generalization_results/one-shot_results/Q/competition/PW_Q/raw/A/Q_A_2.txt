To generate the uppercase letter "A" using the given command and block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) side by side at positions 6 and 7. This will form the two legs of the letter "A".  
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 6)
   ab_drop('b13', 7)
   ```

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) above the two legs at position 6. This will form the crossbar of the letter "A".  
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 6)
   ```

3. Place a square block (b11) above the crossbar at position 6. This will form the top of the letter "A".  
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 6)
   ```

The stream of commands to generate the letter "A" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```
