To generate the uppercase letter "A," we can use the following series of ab_drop() commands:

``` python
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Place the vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place the vertical block at position 3
```

This series of commands will construct the uppercase letter "A" in the Tetris-like environment.
