To generate the uppercase letter "A" using the given block types and commands, we can follow these steps:

1. Place three vertical straight blocks (b13) on top of each other to form the two vertical strokes of the letter "A". Start at position 1, 2, and 3 along the width.
2. On top of the middle block (position 2), place a horizontal straight block (b31) starting at position 1. This block will form the horizontal stroke of the letter "A".
3. Finally, place a square block (b11) on top of the horizontal stroke, at position 3. This block will complete the top of the letter "A".

The stream of commands to generate the letter "A" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Executing these commands consecutively will result in the formation of the uppercase letter "A" within the given environment.
