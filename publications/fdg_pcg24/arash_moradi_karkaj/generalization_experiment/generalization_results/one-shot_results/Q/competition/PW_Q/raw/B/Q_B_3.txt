To generate the uppercase letter "B", we will need to use a combination of block types b31 and b13. Here is a stream of commands that will create the letter "B" in the defined environment:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place the first vertical block on top of the horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place the second horizontal block to the right of the first one
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place the second vertical block on top of the second horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Place the third horizontal block to the right of the second one
ab_drop('b11', 7)   # Place a square block on top of the third horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place the second vertical block on top of the square block
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place the second horizontal block to the left of the second vertical block
```

This series of commands will create a stable representation of the uppercase letter "B" within the defined environment.
