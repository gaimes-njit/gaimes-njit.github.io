To generate the letter "B" using the provided block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b31 block at the X position 1. This will represent the vertical line of the letter "B".
2. Place a b31 block at the X position 1, but at a lower Y position. This will represent the horizontal line of the letter "B".
3. Place a b31 block at the X position 1, but at an even lower Y position. This will represent the bottom curve of the letter "B".
4. Place a b13 block at the X position 2, just beside the vertical line. This will close the bottom curve of the letter "B".
5. Place a b11 block at the X position 3, on top of the vertical line. This will complete the letter "B".

The stream of commands to generate the letter "B" would be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
```
