To generate the uppercase letter "C," we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will place the block types in the required positions to form the letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries.
