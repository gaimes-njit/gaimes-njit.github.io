To generate the uppercase letter "E", we can start by using the "b31" block to create the vertical line on the left side of the letter. Then, we can use the "b13" block to create the horizontal line at the top of the letter. Finally, we can use the "b31" block again to create the vertical line on the right side of the letter.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "E":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively, one after the other, in order to create the letter accurately.
