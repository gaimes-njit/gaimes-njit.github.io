First, we start by constructing the vertical bar of the letter E using block type b13. We need to place three b13 blocks next to each other at positions 1, 2, and 3 along the width. This can be done using the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Next, we move down one row and place a horizontal bar using block type b31. We need to place the b31 block at positions 1, 2, and 3 along the width. This can be done using the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Finally, we move down one more row and place a vertical bar using block type b13. We need to place three b13 blocks next to each other at positions 1, 2, and 3 along the width. This can be done using the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
Therefore, the complete set of commands to generate the letter E would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
