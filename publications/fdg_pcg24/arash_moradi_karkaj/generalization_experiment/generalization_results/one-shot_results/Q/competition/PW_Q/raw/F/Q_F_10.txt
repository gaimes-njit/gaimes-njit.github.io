To generate the letter "F", we can break it down into different parts:

1. The vertical line: We can use the b13 block type to create a vertical line in the first column. We'll need to place four blocks vertically starting from the top.

2. The horizontal line: We can use the b31 block type to create a horizontal line in the second row. We'll need to place three blocks horizontally starting from the left.

Here's the stream of commands to generate the letter "F":

``` python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

This will create the letter "F" in the Tetris-like environment.
