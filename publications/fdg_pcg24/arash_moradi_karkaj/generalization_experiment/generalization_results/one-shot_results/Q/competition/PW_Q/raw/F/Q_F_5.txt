To generate the uppercase English letter "F" using the block types mentioned in the defined environment, the following sequence of ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)    # Place the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)    # Place the second vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)    # Place the second horizontal block at position 2
```

By following these command instructions, the blocks will be placed consecutively to resemble the uppercase letter "F" within the allowed space boundaries.
