To generate the uppercase letter "F", we can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1, 1). This will form the top part of the letter.
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position (1, 2). This will form the vertical line of the letter.
3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1, 3). This will form the bottom part of the letter.

Using the ab_drop() command, the stream of commands to generate the letter "F" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',1)
```
