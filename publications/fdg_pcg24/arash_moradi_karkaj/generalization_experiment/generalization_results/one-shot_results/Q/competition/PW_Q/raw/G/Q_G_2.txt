To generate the uppercase letter "G", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "G" in the defined environment, following the gravity rules for stacking and stability.
