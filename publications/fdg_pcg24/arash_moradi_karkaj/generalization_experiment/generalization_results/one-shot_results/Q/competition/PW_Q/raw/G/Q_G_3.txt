To generate the uppercase letter "G", we need to use a combination of the block types mentioned. Here is a stream of commands to create the letter "G":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "G" within the allowed space boundaries and maintain structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
