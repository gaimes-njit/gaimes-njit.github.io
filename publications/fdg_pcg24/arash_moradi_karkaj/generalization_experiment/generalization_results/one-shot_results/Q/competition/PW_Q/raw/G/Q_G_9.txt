To generate the uppercase letter "G", we can break it down into the following steps:

1. Start by using the `b13` block type to create the vertical stroke of the letter "G". Place it at position 1 along the width.
2. Use the `b31` block type to create the top horizontal stroke of the letter "G". Place it at position 2 along the width.
3. Use the `b11` block type to create the middle horizontal stroke of the letter "G". Place it at position 2 along the width.
4. Use the `b31` block type again to create the bottom horizontal stroke of the letter "G". Place it at position 2 along the width.
5. Finally, use the `b31` block type to create the tail of the letter "G". Place it at position 3 along the width.

Here is the stream of `ab_drop()` commands to generate the uppercase letter "G":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```
