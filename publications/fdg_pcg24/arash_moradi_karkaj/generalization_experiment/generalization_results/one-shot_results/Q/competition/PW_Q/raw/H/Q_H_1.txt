The solution to generate the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types and environment is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. The first `ab_drop('b31', 1)` command places a horizontal straight block of width 3 units at position 1. This forms the top part of the letter "H".
2. The second `ab_drop('b31', 5)` command places another horizontal straight block of width 3 units at position 5. This forms the bottom part of the letter "H".
3. The third `ab_drop('b13', 3)` command places a vertical straight block of height 3 units at position 3. This forms the vertical line of the letter "H" in the middle.

By executing these commands consecutively, the resulting shape will resemble the uppercase letter "H" within the given environment and gravity rules.
