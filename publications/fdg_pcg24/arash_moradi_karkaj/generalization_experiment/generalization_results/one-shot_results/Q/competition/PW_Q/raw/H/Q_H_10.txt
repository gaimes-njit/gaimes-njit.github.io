To generate the uppercase letter "H", we can use a combination of block types b13 and b31. Here is the stream of commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a vertical block (b13) at position 1 to form the left vertical line of the letter "H".
- Then, we place another vertical block (b13) at position 2 to extend the left vertical line.
- Next, we place a horizontal block (b31) at position 2 to form the horizontal line of the letter "H".
- After that, we place another vertical block (b13) at position 2 to extend the right vertical line.
- Finally, we place the last vertical block (b13) at position 3 to complete the right vertical line of the letter "H".

This will result in a stable representation of the uppercase letter "H" within the allowed space boundaries.
