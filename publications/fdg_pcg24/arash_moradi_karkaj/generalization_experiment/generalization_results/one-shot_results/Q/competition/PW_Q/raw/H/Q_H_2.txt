To generate the uppercase letter "H", we can break it down into three block types: two vertical straight blocks (b13) and one horizontal straight block (b31). We can place the blocks consecutively to form the letter.

To achieve this, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position 5
```

Please note that the positions mentioned in the commands may vary slightly depending on the alignment and spacing desired within the allowed space. The given positions are just for reference and can be adjusted accordingly to create a visually accurate "H" shape.
