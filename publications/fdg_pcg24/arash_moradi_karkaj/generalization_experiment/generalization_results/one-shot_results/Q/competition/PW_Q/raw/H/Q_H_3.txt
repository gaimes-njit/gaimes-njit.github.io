To generate the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types and rules, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a square block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
```

By following these commands in order, we can generate the letter "H" in the Tetris-like environment while ensuring stability and staying within the boundary limits.
