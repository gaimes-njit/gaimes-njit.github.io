To generate the uppercase letter H, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # First horizontal line of the letter H
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Second horizontal line of the letter H
ab_drop('b31', 3)  # Third horizontal line of the letter H
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Vertical line of the letter H
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter H within the grid.
