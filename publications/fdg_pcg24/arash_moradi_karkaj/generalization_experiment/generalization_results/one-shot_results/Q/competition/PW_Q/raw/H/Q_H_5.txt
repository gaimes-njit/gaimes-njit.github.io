To generate the uppercase letter "H", we can use a combination of block types b31 and b13. Here is the stream of commands to create the letter "H":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "H" in the allowed space while adhering to the gravity rules.
