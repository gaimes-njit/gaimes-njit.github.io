To generate the uppercase English letter "H", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Explanation: 
1. The first two `ab_drop('b31', x)` commands are used to create the two vertical lines of the letter "H".
2. The `ab_drop('b11', 4)` and `ab_drop('b11', 5)` commands are used to create the horizontal line of the letter "H".
3. Finally, the last two `ab_drop('b13', x)` commands are used to create the bottom part of the letter "H".

Please note that the exact positions of each block may vary slightly as long as the resulting shape resembles the letter "H" and obeys the stacking and stability rules.
