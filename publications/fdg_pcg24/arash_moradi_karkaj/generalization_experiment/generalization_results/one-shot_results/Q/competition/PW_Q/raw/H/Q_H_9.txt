To create the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types and environment, we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

``` python
# Drop the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Drop the second square block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 1)

# Drop the third vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Drop the fourth horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Drop the fifth square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

This series of commands will create an uppercase letter "H" within the defined environment while maintaining stability and obeying the gravity rules.
