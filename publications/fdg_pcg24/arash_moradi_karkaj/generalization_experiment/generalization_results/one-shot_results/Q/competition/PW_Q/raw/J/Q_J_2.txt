To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

Explanation:
- First, we drop a vertical straight block 'b13' at position 1 to form the left side of the letter "J".
- Then, we drop a horizontal straight block 'b31' at position 1 to form the top part of the letter "J".
- Finally, we drop three 1x1 square blocks 'b11' at position 4 to form the right side of the letter "J".

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "J" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
