To generate the uppercase letter "J" using the given block types, we need to use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will create the shape of the letter "J" in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
