To generate the uppercase letter "J", we need to use the following block types and positions:

1. Place a b13 block at position (1, 2) to create the vertical line of the "J".
2. Place a b31 block at position (2, 1) to create the horizontal line at the top of the "J".
3. Place a b11 block at position (2, 2) to create the bottom left corner of the "J".

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

This sequence of ab_drop commands will generate the uppercase letter "J" in the Tetris-like environment.
