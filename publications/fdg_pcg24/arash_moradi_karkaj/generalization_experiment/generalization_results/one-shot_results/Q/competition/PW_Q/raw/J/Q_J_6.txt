To generate the uppercase letter "J", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b11',4)
```

Explanation:
1. The first two commands (`ab_drop('b31',1)` and `ab_drop('b31',2)`) create the vertical part of the letter "J".
2. The third command (`ab_drop('b13',3)`) creates the horizontal part of the letter "J".
3. The fourth command (`ab_drop('b11',4)`) adds a small square block to complete the letter "J".

Make sure to follow the gravity rules and place each block one by one to maintain stability.
