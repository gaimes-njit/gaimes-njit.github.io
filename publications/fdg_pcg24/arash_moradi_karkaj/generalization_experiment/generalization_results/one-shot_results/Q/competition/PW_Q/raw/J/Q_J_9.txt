To generate the uppercase letter "J", we will need to use the following block types and their corresponding positions:

- Block type b31 will be placed at position 1.
- Block type b13 will be placed at position 4.
- Block type b11 will be placed at positions 2 and 3.

The stream of commands to generate the letter "J" is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

By executing these commands consecutively, the resulting shape will resemble the uppercase letter "J" within the allowed boundaries of the grid.
