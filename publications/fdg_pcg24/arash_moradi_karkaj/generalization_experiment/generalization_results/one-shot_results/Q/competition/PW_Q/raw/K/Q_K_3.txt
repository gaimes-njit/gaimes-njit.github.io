In order to generate the uppercase English letter "K", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence of commands will form the letter "K" within the allowed boundaries of the grid, following the gravity rules.
