To generate the uppercase letter "L", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how this generates the letter "L":

1. The first three commands (`ab_drop('b13', 1)`, `ab_drop('b13', 2)`, `ab_drop('b13', 3)`) place three vertical blocks in a row, creating the vertical part of the "L" shape.

2. The fourth command (`ab_drop('b31', 3)`) places a horizontal block on top of the third vertical block, creating the horizontal part of the "L" shape.

When the blocks settle according to the gravity rules, it will form the uppercase letter "L" within the allowed space boundaries.
