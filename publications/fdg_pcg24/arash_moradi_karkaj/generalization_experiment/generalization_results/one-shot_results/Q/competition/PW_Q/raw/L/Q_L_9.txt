To generate the uppercase letter "L", we can use the block types b31 and b13. Here is a stream of commands that will construct the letter "L" in the given environment:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

The above commands will place the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter "L" within the boundaries of the allowed space.
