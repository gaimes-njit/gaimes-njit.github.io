To generate the uppercase English letter "M," you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "M" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and respecting the boundaries.
