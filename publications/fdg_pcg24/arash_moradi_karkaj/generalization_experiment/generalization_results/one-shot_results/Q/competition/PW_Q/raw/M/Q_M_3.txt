To generate the uppercase letter "M" using the provided block types and environment, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 10
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 8
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "M" by stacking and aligning the blocks in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
