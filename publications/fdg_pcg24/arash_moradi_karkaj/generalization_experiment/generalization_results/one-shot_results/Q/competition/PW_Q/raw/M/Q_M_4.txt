To generate the uppercase English letter "M", we can use a combination of block types b11 and b31. 

Here is the stream of commands to create the letter "M":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)    # Place the second horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7)    # Place the third horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop('b11', 2)    # Place the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)    # Place the second vertical block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 5)    # Place the third vertical block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 6)    # Place the fourth vertical block at position 6
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable "M" shape within the allowed space boundaries.
