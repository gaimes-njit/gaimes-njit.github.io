To generate the uppercase letter "M" using the given block types in the defined environment, the stream of commands would be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place first block at position (1,1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place second block at position (2,2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place third block at position (3,4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place fourth block at position (2,5)
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place fifth block at position (1,6)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "M" with the given block types while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
