To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we need to use the following block types and their corresponding positions:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4: `ab_drop('b31', 4)`

This will create the letter "N" in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules. Here is the complete stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
