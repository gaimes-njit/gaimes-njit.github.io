To generate the uppercase letter "N", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

Explanation:
1. `ab_drop('b31', 1)` - This command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1, creating the leftmost vertical line of the letter "N".
2. `ab_drop('b13', 4)` - This command places a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4, connecting the leftmost vertical line to the diagonal line of the letter "N".
3. `ab_drop('b31', 7)` - This command places another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 7, completing the diagonal line of the letter "N".

Note: The position values for the blocks are based on the width of the grid (20W).
