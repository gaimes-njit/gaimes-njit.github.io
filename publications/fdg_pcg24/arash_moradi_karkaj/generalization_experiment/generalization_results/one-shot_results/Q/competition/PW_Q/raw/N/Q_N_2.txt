To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Place a square block at position 7
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 9
ab_drop('b13', 10) # Place a vertical straight block at position 10
```

These commands will generate the letter "N" in the Tetris-like environment, following the stacking and stability rules.
