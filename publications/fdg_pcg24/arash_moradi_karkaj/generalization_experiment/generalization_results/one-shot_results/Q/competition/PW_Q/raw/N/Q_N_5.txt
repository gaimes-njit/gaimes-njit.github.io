To generate the letter "N" using the provided block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position (1, 1) using the command `ab_drop('b13', 1)`.

2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (4, 1) using the command `ab_drop('b31', 4)`. This will form the left vertical stroke of the letter "N".

3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position (7, 1) using the command `ab_drop('b13', 7)`. This will form the diagonal stroke of the letter "N".

4. Finally, place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (10, 1) using the command `ab_drop('b31', 10)`. This will complete the letter "N".

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "N" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```
