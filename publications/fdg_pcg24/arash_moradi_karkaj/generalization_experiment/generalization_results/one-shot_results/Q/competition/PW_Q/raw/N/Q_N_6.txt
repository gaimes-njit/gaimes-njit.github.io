To generate the uppercase English letter "N", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1, creating the left side of the letter "N".
- The second command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places a vertical straight block at position 2, connecting the left side to the middle of the letter "N".
- The third command `ab_drop('b31', 4)` places another horizontal straight block at position 4, extending the middle part of the letter "N".
- The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 7)` places the final horizontal straight block at position 7, completing the right side of the letter "N".

This sequence of commands will stack the blocks in a stable manner and form the uppercase letter "N" within the allowed space.
