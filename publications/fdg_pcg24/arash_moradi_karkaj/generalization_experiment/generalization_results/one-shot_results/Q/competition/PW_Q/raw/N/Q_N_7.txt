To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use the following sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by dropping a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
2. Next, we drop a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 4. This completes the left side of the letter "N".
3. Then, we drop another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 7 to bridge the gap between the left and right sides.
4. Next, we drop a 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 10 to form the diagonal part of the letter "N".
5. After that, we drop another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 10 to connect the diagonal part to the right side.
6. Finally, we drop another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 13 to complete the right side of the letter "N".

By following these commands, we will be able to construct the uppercase English letter "N" within the given environment and gravity rules.
