To generate the uppercase English letter "N", you can use the following stream of `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',7)
ab_drop('b13',10)
ab_drop('b31',13)
ab_drop('b31',16)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "N" by stacking the block types in the specified positions within the allowed space boundaries.
