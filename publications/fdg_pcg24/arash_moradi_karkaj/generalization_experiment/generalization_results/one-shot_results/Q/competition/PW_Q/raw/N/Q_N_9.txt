To generate the letter "N" using the ab_drop() command and the block types mentioned, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 in the first row.
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 in the second row.
3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4 in the third row.

This sequence of commands will create a shape that resembles the uppercase letter "N" while maintaining stability and fitting within the allowed space boundaries.
