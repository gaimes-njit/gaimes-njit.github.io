To generate the uppercase letter "O" using the given block types, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in a way that forms the letter "O" within the allowed space boundaries and follows the gravity rules.
