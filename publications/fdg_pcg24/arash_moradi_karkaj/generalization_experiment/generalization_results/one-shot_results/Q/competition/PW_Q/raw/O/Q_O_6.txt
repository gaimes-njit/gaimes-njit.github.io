To generate the uppercase English letter "O", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing three horizontal straight blocks ('b31') horizontally at positions 3, 7, and 11. This forms the top and bottom parts of the letter "O".
- Then, we place two vertical straight blocks ('b13') vertically at positions 3 and 11. This forms the left and right sides of the letter "O".
- Finally, we repeat the same steps as before to reinforce the structure of the letter "O" and make it more stable.

By following these commands, you should be able to generate the uppercase English letter "O" in the Tetris-like environment.
