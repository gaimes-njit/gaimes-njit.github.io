To generate the capital letter "P" using the given block types, we can follow the following steps:

1. Start by placing a b31 block at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a b31 block right below the first block, at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

3. Place a b13 block right next to the last b31 block, at position 4:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

4. Place a b11 block right above the last b13 block, at position 4:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

5. Place another b11 block right above the first b31 block, at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

6. Place another b11 block right above the second b31 block, at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

And that's it! By following these steps, you will generate the capital letter "P" using the given block types in the defined environment.
