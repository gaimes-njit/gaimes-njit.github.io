To generate the letter P, we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter P in the Tetris-like environment while adhering to the gravity rules and fitting within the allowed space boundaries.
