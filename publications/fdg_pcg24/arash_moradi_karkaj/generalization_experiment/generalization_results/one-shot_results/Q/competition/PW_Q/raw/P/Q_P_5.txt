To generate the uppercase letter "P," we will use the following block types and positions:

1. Place a b31 block at position (1, 1).
2. Place a b13 block at position (4, 1).
3. Place a b31 block at position (1, 4).
4. Place a b11 block at position (4, 4).

The resulting stream of commands would be as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',4)
```
