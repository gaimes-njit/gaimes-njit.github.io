To create the uppercase letter "P", we can break it down into the following steps:

1. Start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1, just below the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2, next to the previous block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, just below the previous blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
