To generate the uppercase letter "P", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

These commands will create the letter "P" using the defined block types and stacking them in the correct order to form the desired shape.
