To generate the uppercase letter "R" using the given block types and gravity rules, we need to follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to form the top line of the letter. Use the command `ab_drop('b31', 1)`.

2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to form the left side of the letter. Use the command `ab_drop('b13', 1)`.

3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 to form the right side of the letter. Use the command `ab_drop('b13', 3)`.

4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to form the middle line of the letter. Use the command `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.

5. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 to form the bottom part of the letter. Use the command `ab_drop('b13', 2)`.

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter "R" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Make sure to execute these commands consecutively, one after the other, within the designated environment.
