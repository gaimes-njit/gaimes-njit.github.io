To generate the uppercase letter "S", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place the third horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the third vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1 (second row)
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2 (second row)
ab_drop('b31',3)  # Place the third horizontal straight block at position 3 (second row)
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 3 (third row)
ab_drop('b13',2)  # Place another vertical straight block at position 2 (third row)
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place the third vertical straight block at position 1 (third row)
```

These commands will generate the uppercase letter "S" within the specified boundaries and following the gravity rules.
