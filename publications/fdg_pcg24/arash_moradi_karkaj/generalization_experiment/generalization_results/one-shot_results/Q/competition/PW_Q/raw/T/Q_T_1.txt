To generate the uppercase letter T, we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

Explanation:

1. We start by dropping a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 along the width.
2. Next, we drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2. This forms the vertical part of the T.
3. Then, we drop three square blocks (b11) at positions 2, 3, and 4. These form the horizontal part of the T.

By following these commands, you will generate the uppercase letter T within the allowed space boundaries.
