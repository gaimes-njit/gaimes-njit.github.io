To generate uppercase English letter "T" using the ab_drop() command and block types, follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1: ab_drop('b31', 1)
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2: ab_drop('b13', 2)
3. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2: ab_drop('b31', 2)

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "T" within the allowed space boundaries and maintain stability according to the gravity rules. The final solution should be included between three backticks (```). 

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```
