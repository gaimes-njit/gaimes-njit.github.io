To generate the uppercase letter "T", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

Explanation:
- We start by dropping a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1. This forms the top of the letter "T".
- Next, we drop a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2. This forms the vertical line of the letter "T".
- Then, we drop three square blocks ('b11') consecutively at positions 2, 3, and 4. These form the horizontal line of the letter "T".

By executing these commands in the given environment, we will accurately generate the uppercase letter "T" with the specified stacking and stability rules.
