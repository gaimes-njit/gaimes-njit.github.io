To generate the uppercase English letter "U", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 13)
ab_drop('b13', 16)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "U" within the defined grid boundaries while adhering to the gravity rules.
