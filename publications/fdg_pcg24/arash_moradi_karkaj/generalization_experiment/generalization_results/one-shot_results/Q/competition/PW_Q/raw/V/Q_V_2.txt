To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 6
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 9
```

This sequence of commands will create the shape of the letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries, with proper stacking and stability.
