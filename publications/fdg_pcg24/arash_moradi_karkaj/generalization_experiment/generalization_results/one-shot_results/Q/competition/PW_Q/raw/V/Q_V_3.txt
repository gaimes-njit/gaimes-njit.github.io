To stack and create the uppercase letter "V" using the provided block types, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a b31 block at position (1, 1):
```plaintext
ab_drop(b31, 1)
```

2. Place a b13 block below the previous block at position (1, 2):
```plaintext
ab_drop(b13, 1)
```

3. Place another b31 block to the right of the previous b13 block at position (4, 2):
```plaintext
ab_drop(b31, 4)
```

4. Finally, place another b13 block below the previous b31 block at position (4, 3):
```plaintext
ab_drop(b13, 4)
```

The sequence of commands to generate the uppercase letter "V" would be:
```plaintext
ab_drop(b31, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b31, 4)
ab_drop(b13, 4)
```

Note: Make sure to execute each command consecutively, one after the other, to create the desired shape accurately within the defined boundaries.
