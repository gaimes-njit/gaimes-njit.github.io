To generate the uppercase English letter "V", you can use the following stream of commands:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31', 1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1, forming the top part of the "V".
- The second command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` places a vertical straight block at position 2, connecting the top and bottom parts of the "V".
- The third command `ab_drop('b31', 4)` places another horizontal straight block at position 4, completing the bottom part of the "V".

This sequence of commands ensures that the blocks are placed consecutively, forming the letter "V", and are structurally stable according to the gravity rules.
