To generate the uppercase letter "W" using the block types and gravity rules, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the first vertical straight block (b13) at position 1: `ab_drop('b13', 1)`.
2. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) directly below the previous block at position 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.
3. Place the second vertical straight block (b13) directly below the previous block at position 3: `ab_drop('b13', 3)`.
4. Place the horizontal straight block (b31) directly below the previous block at position 4: `ab_drop('b31', 4)`.
5. Place the third vertical straight block (b13) directly below the previous block at position 5: `ab_drop('b13', 5)`.

Finally, the stream of commands to generate the letter "W" would be:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
