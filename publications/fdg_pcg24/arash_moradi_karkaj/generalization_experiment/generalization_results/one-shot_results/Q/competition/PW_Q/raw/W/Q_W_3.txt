To generate the uppercase letter "W", we can break it down into three parts: two diagonal strokes and a middle horizontal stroke. 

First, let's start with the first diagonal stroke. We can use the block type "b13" (vertical straight block) for this part. We need to place it at position 1 along the width and let gravity pull it down to the desired height. 

```py
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Next, let's move to the second diagonal stroke. Again, we will use the block type "b13" but this time we need to place it at position 5 along the width to create the diagonal effect. 

```py
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Finally, we need to add the middle horizontal stroke. For this, we will use the block type "b31" (horizontal straight block). We need to place it at position 2 along the width to align it with the two diagonal strokes. 

```py
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Combining all the commands, we get:

```py
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will create the uppercase letter "W" in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
