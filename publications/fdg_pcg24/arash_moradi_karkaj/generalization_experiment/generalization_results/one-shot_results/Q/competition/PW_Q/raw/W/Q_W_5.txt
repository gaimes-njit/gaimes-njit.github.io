To generate the uppercase letter "W", we will break it down into three parts: two vertical straight blocks (b13) on the sides and a horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place first vertical straight block on the left
ab_drop('b31',2)  # Place horizontal straight block in the middle
ab_drop('b13',4)  # Place second vertical straight block on the right
```

Please note that the exact position and alignment of the blocks within the grid may need adjustments depending on the specific implementation of the Tetris-like environment.
