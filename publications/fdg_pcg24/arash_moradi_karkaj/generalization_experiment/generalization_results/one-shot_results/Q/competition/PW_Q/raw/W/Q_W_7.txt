To generate the uppercase letter "W" using the provided block types in the defined environment, you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

Make sure to execute the commands consecutively, one by one, in a Tetris-like environment. This sequence of commands will construct the letter "W" by stacking and placing the blocks in the correct positions.
