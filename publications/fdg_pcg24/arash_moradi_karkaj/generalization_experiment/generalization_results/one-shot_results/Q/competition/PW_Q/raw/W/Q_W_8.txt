To generate the uppercase English letter "W," we can start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. Then, we will place a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 2, 3, and 4. Finally, we will place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4.

```plaintext
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',4)
```
