To generate the uppercase letter "X", we can follow these steps:

1. Drop a b31 block at position 1 to create the left diagonal part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Drop a b31 block at position 5 to create the right diagonal part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

3. Drop a b13 block at position 5 to create the middle part of the letter:
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to generate the letter "X" would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
