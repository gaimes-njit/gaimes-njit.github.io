To generate the uppercase English letter "X", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

This sequence of commands will first create the left diagonal of the "X" using a horizontal straight block (b31) and a vertical straight block (b13). Then, it will create the right diagonal of the "X" using the same block types. By following these steps, the "X" shape will be formed while ensuring stability within the defined environment.
