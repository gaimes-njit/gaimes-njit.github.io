To generate the uppercase English letter "X", we can use a combination of the block types b31 and b13. Here is a stream of commands that will resemble the target letter "X":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter "X".
