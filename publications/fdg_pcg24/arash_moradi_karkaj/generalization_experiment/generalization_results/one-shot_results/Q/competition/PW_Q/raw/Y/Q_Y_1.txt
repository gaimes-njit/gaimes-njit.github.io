To generate the uppercase letter "Y", we can break it down into three parts:

1. The diagonal stroke: This can be achieved by stacking two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other diagonally. Let's place the first block at position (1, 9) and the second block at position (2, 11).

2. The upper arm: This can be achieved by stacking a horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the diagonal stroke. Let's place the block at position (3, 9).

3. The lower arm: This can be achieved by stacking a horizontal straight block (b31) below the diagonal stroke. Let's place the block at position (3, 11).

Here is the sequence of commands to generate the letter "Y":

```
ab_drop('b13',9)
ab_drop('b13',11)
ab_drop('b31',9)
ab_drop('b31',11)
```

Please note that you should include these commands consecutively between three backticks (```) as mentioned in the prompt.
