To generate the uppercase letter "Y", we can break it down into three block types: b31, b11, and b13. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place the vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 2)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 2 to complete the letter
```
