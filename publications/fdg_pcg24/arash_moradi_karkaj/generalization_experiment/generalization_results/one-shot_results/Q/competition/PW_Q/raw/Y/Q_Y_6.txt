To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b11',4)
```

Explanation: 
- First, we drop a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to form the left arm of the Y.
- Then, we drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 to form the stem of the Y.
- Next, we drop three 1x1 square blocks (b11) at positions 2, 3, and 4 to form the top of the Y.
- Finally, we have successfully generated the uppercase English letter "Y" using the given block types and gravity rules.
