To generate the letter "Y", we need to carefully stack and position the blocks in the Tetris-like environment. Here are the commands to achieve this:

``` 
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place a 1x1 square block at position 1 to start the letter
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal straight block with width 3 at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block with height 3 at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place a 1x1 square block at position 3 to complete the letter
```

When executed, these commands will generate the letter "Y" in the Tetris-like environment.
