To generate the uppercase letter "Y" using the given block types and grid, we can break it down into three steps:

Step 1: Place the first vertical straight block (b13) at position (5, 6):
``` 
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Step 2: Place the horizontal straight block (b31) on top of the vertical straight block at position (4, 6):
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Step 3: Place the second vertical straight block (b13) on top of the horizontal straight block at position (3, 6):
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Combining all the steps, the complete stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "Y" would be:
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
