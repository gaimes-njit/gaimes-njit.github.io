To generate the uppercase letter "Z" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b31 block at position 1: `ab_drop('b31', 1)`
2. Place a b13 block at position 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
3. Place a b31 block at position 4: `ab_drop('b31', 4)`

These commands will construct the letter "Z" within the allowed space boundaries. Here is the complete stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
