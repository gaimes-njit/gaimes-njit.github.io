To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "D" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid: Use the provided code to initialize an empty grid with dimensions WxH.

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks: As per the stability constraint, the structure should have a solid base to prevent overhangs. We'll use two b11 blocks placed at slots 8 and 11 as the base.

```python
structure[H-1][8] = 'b11'
structure[H-1][11] = 'b11'
```

3. Place the vertical block: The D shape requires a vertical block in the middle to form the letter's curve. We can place a b13 block at slot 9 in the layer just above the base.

```python
structure[H-2][9] = 'b13'
```

4. Place the upper horizontal block: To complete the D shape, we need to place a b31 block horizontally above the vertical block. We can place it at slots 7, 8, and 9 in the layer two levels above the base.

```python
structure[H-4][7] = 'b31'
structure[H-4][8] = 'b31'
structure[H-4][9] = 'b31'
```

5. Place the lower horizontal block: To ensure stability and prevent separation, we can place a b31 block horizontally at the bottom of the structure, partially covering the base blocks. We'll use slots 6, 7, 8, and 9 in the bottom layer.

```python
structure[H-1][6] = 'b31'
structure[H-1][7] = 'b31'
structure[H-1][8] = 'b31'
structure[H-1][9] = 'b31'
```

6. Use the ab_drop() function: Once the structure is prepared, we can use the ab_drop() function to vertically drop each block in the correct order and position.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

This will ensure that all blocks are placed correctly in the structure grid while meeting the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. The resulting structure will resemble the character "D".
