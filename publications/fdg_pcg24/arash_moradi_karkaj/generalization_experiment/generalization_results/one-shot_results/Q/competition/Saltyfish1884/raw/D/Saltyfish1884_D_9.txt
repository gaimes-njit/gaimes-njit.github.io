To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "D" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b31 block on the solid base (bottom layer) to form the vertical part of the "D".
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

3. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block to complete the vertical part of the "D".
```
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

4. Place a b31 block on the right side of the vertical part of the "D" to form the top part of the "D".
```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

5. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block to complete the top part of the "D".
```
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

6. Place a b13 block on the left side of the vertical part of the "D" to form the bottom part of the "D".
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

7. Place a b11 block on top of the b13 block to complete the bottom part of the "D".
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

The structure will now resemble the character "D" and meet all the hard constraints.

Note: The specific slot numbers used in the ab_drop() function are just one possible solution.
