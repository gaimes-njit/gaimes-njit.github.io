To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all the given constraints, we can use the ab_drop() function to strategically place the blocks. 

First, let's analyze the stability rules:
1) A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
2) Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
3) The structure should not be separated.

Based on these rules, we can determine the order and position of the blocks to form the "H" shape. Here is a step-by-step approach:

Step 1: Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) to create a solid foundation. We will use b13 blocks for stability and to have a wider base. The center slot will be occupied by a b13 block.

```
structure[0][9] = 'b13'
```

Step 2: Place the vertical extension of the "H" shape by placing b13 blocks above the base block in the center and on either side. The bottom slot of each vertical extension should be aligned with the base block.

```
structure[1][9] = 'b13'
structure[2][9] = 'b13'
```

Step 3: Place the horizontal bar of the "H" shape by placing a b31 block above the vertical extensions. The center slot of the b31 block should be aligned with the base block.

```
structure[2][8] = 'b31'
```

Step 4: Place b13 blocks on either side of the horizontal bar to complete the "H" shape.

```
structure[2][7] = 'b13'
structure[2][6] = 'b13'
```

Step 5: Place b11 blocks on top of the vertical extensions to complete the vertical lines of the "H" shape.

```
structure[3][9] = 'b11'
structure[3][8] = 'b11'
```

Step 6: Use the ab_drop() function to vertically drop the blocks in the correct order and positions according to the steps above.

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

After executing the above code, the "H" shape will be generated in the structure grid while satisfying all the hard constraints.

Please note that the provided solution is just an example, and you can modify the block positions and order to generate different structures.
