To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "P", we need to carefully consider the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the b31 block to form the vertical part of the character "P":
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

3. Drop the b11 block to form the horizontal part of the character "P":
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 10)
   ```

4. Drop the b13 block on top of the b11 block to complete the vertical stroke of the character "P":
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

5. Adjust the position of the b31 block to align the structure properly:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

6. Drop the b11 block on top of the structure to form the top part of the character "P":
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 8)
   ```

7. Adjust the position of the b31 block to align the structure properly:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ```

8. Add additional b11 blocks at the bottom layers to ensure stability:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 0)
   ab_drop('b11', 1)
   ```

9. Adjust the position of the b31 and b13 blocks to align the structure properly:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   ```

10. Check the stability and boundary intrusion constraints to ensure the structure is stable and does not intrude on the boundaries.

The resulting structure should resemble the character "P" while meeting all the given constraints.
