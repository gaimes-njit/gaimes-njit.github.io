To generate a stable structure resembling the character "S" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the given code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping position and order of the blocks. We need to consider stability and ensure that the blocks are placed as low as possible. Based on the shape of the character "S", we can infer that it can be formed using two b31 blocks and two b13 blocks.

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in the determined order and position. Place the first b31 block near the left boundary to act as the base of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will drop a b31 block at slot 1.

4. Drop the first b13 block above the base, aligned with the left side of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```
This will drop a b13 block at slot 0.

5. Drop the second b31 block above the base, this time aligned with the right side of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 18)
```
This will drop a b31 block at slot 18.

6. Drop the second b13 block above the base, aligned with the right side of the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```
This will drop a b13 block at slot 19.

7. The structure should now resemble the character "S". You can print or visualize the structure to confirm.
