To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" using the ab_drop() function, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid as an empty WxH grid using the provided code.

2. Place a b31 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and the center slot (W // 2) to form the base of the "T" shape. Use the ab_drop(3, W // 2) function to vertically drop the b31 block into place.

3. Place two b13 blocks vertically on top of the base block, centered above the two outer slots of the base block. Use the ab_drop(2, W // 2 - 1) and ab_drop(2, W // 2 + 1) functions to drop the b13 blocks into place.

4. Finally, place a b11 block on top of the two b13 blocks, centered above the middle slot of the base block. Use the ab_drop(1, W // 2) function to drop the b11 block into place.

By following these steps, you will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all the given hard constraints.

Here is an example of the code for generating the "T" shape:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Place the base block
ab_drop(3, W // 2)

# Place the two vertical blocks
ab_drop(2, W // 2 - 1)
ab_drop(2, W // 2 + 1)

# Place the top block
ab_drop(1, W // 2)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This code will output the following structure:

```
               
               
       O       
    OOOOOOO    
       O       
       O        
       O        
       O        
       O        
       O        
       O        
       O        
       O        
       O        
       O        
       O        
       O        
```
