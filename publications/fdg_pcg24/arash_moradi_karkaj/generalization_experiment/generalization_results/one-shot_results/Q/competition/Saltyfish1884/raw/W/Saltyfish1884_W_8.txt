To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "W" while meeting all the hard constraints, we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Determine the dropping position and order of the blocks by considering the stability rules mentioned in the constraints.
- Start by dropping a b31 block at the center slot (y = W // 2) on the base (layer 0) to form the middle peak of the "W".
- Next, drop two b11 blocks on both sides of the middle peak to form the side peaks of the "W".
- Finally, drop two b13 blocks on the outer sides of the side peaks to complete the structure.

Step 3: Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in the determined position and order.
```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)  # Drop b31 block at the center slot
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 - 1)  # Drop b11 block on the left side
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 + 1)  # Drop b11 block on the right side
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 - 2)  # Drop b13 block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 + 2)  # Drop b13 block on the right side
```

Step 4: Print the final structure to see the result.
```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Here's the complete code:

```python
W = 20  # Width of the map
H = 16  # Height of the map

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop blocks to form the structure
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned

    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)

    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break

    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Drop blocks to form the "W" structure
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)  # Drop b31 block at the center slot
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 - 1)  # Drop b11 block on the left side
ab_drop('b11', W // 2 + 1)  # Drop b11 block on the right side
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 - 2)  # Drop b13 block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 + 2)  # Drop b13 block on the right side

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The output will be a stable structure that resembles the character "W".
