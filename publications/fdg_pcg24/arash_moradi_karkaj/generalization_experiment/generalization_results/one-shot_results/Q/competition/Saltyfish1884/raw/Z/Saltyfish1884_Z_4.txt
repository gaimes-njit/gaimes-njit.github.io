To generate a stable structure resembling the character "Z" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. We can drop a b11 block at slot 9 as the base, and then drop a b31 block centered at slot 9 above the base.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 3: Place the first "Z" shape. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 6 on top of the previous block, followed by a b13 block centered at slot 5 above the b31 block.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Step 4: Place the second "Z" shape. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 13 on top of the previous block, followed by a b31 block centered at slot 12 above the b13 block.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 13)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

Step 5: Place the final b31 block on top of the structure. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 9 above the second "Z" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure resembling the character "Z" while meeting all the hard constraints.
