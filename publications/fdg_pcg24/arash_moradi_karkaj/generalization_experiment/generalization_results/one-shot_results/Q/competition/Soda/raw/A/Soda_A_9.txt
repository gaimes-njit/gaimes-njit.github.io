To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "A", we can follow these steps:

1. Build the two diagonal lines of the "A" from bottom to top.
2. Place a square block at the center of the "A" to connect the two diagonal lines.
3. Place a row block above the square block to complete the structure.

Here is the code implementation to achieve this:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This code will create a stable structure with the shape of a capital "A" in the given level.
