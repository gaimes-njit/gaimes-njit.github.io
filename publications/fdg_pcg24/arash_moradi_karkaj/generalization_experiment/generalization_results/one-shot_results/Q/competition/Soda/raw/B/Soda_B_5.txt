To build a structure in the shape of the letter "B" using the ab_drop() function, we can break down the letter into three separate blocks. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the bottom bar of the "B" shape
We start by placing a row block (b31) at the bottom center of the grid.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Step 2: Place the upper-left part of the "B" shape
Next, we place a column block (b13) on the left side of the grid, centered vertically.

ab_drop("b13", 5)

Step 3: Place the upper-right part of the "B" shape
Finally, we place another column block (b13) on the right side of the grid, centered vertically.

ab_drop("b13", 13)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```
