To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "C" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop blocks while considering stability and boundary intrusion.

First, let's initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

Next, we can start dropping blocks using the `ab_drop()` function. The goal is to create a "C" shape, so we need to drop blocks in a way that satisfies this shape while maintaining stability and avoiding boundary intrusion.

Here is a step-by-step procedure to achieve the desired structure:

1. Drop a b31 block at slot 5:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

2. Drop a b31 block at slot 5 again, but at a higher layer:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

3. Drop a b31 block at slot 5 again, but at an even higher layer:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

4. Drop a b13 block at slot 8, aligning its center with the bottom of the previously dropped b31 blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

5. Drop a b13 block at slot 8 again, but at a higher layer:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

6. Drop a b13 block at slot 8 again, but at an even higher layer:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

7. Drop a b13 block at slot 7, aligning its center with the center of the previously dropped b13 block in step 4:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

8. Drop a b13 block at slot 6, aligning its center with the bottom of the previously dropped b13 block in step 7:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

9. Drop a b13 block at slot 6 again, but at a higher layer:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

10. Drop a b13 block at slot 6 again, but at an even higher layer:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

By following this step-by-step procedure, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "C" and meets all the constraints.

Note: The exact positions and heights mentioned in the steps above are just an example. You can experiment with different positions to achieve a stable "C" shape structure. The key is to ensure proper weight distribution and avoid boundary intrusion.
