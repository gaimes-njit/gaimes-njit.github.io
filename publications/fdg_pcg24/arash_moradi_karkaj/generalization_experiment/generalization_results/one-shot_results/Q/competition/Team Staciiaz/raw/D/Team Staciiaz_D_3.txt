To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "D" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Use `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a specific order to form the character "D".

To meet the stability constraint, we need to ensure that the weight distribution is proper. We can achieve this by dropping the blocks from bottom to top and from left to right.

To meet the constraint of no boundary intrusion, we need to make sure that the blocks don't intrude on the boundary of the map. This can be achieved by carefully choosing the dropping positions for each block.

Here is an example of how we can use the `ab_drop()` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the character "D" and meets all the constraints:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)   # Drop a vertical block at slot 2
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Drop another vertical block at slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 0)   # Drop a horizontal block at slot 0
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Drop another horizontal block at slot 1
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Drop a square block at slot 3
```

This sequence of dropping positions will create a stable structure that looks like the character "D" and meets all the constraints.
