To generate a stable structure resembling the character "H" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping positions and order for each block type to ensure stability and no boundary intrusion. We can follow these guidelines:
   - Start by dropping the b11 block at the center slot (slot 9) of the bottom layer (layer 0).
   - Drop the b31 block above the b11 block, aligning its center slot with the center slot of the b11 block.
   - Finally, drop two b13 blocks on both sides of the b31 block, aligning their center slots with the center slot of the b31 block.

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop each block type at the determined positions and order. The code for dropping blocks can be written as follows:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
```

4. The resulting `structure` grid will represent a stable structure resembling the character "H".

Here's the complete code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # Code for the ab_drop function as provided
    
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
```

Note: The code given above is just a basic guideline to illustrate the process. Depending on your specific requirements and visuals of stability and no boundary intrusion, you may need to adjust the dropping positions and order of the blocks accordingly.
