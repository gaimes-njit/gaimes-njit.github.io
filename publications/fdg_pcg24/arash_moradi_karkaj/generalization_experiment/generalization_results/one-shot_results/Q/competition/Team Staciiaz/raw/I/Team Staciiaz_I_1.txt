To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "I" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in a systematic way. Here is an approach to achieve this:

1. Drop a `b13` block at slot 9 using `ab_drop('b13', 9)`. This block will act as the main vertical part of the "I" character.

2. Drop a `b31` block at slot 9 and layer 3 using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`. This block will act as the horizontal part of the "I" character.

3. Repeat step 2 two more times, each time dropping the block at a higher layer. Drop the second block at layer 6 and the third block at layer 9. This will create three horizontal parts of the "I" character.

4. Drop a `b11` block at slot 9 and layer 12 using `ab_drop('b11', 9)`. This block will act as the top vertical part of the "I" character.

By following this approach, we ensure that the structure meets the stability constraint because we are dropping blocks on top of each other with proper weight distribution. We also satisfy the no boundary intrusion constraint because the blocks are centered within the available slots and do not intrude on the boundary of the map.

The resulting structure will resemble the character "I" and will be stable and free from boundary intrusion.
