To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "K" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to drop the blocks in a way that satisfies all the given constraints. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Start by initializing the structure grid using the `structure` variable provided in the environment.

2. Drop the first block, b13, at a suitable slot and layer to form the vertical part of the "K". Use the `ab_drop()` function with block_type = 'b13' and an appropriate x_position that aligns the block center with the desired slot.

3. Drop the second block, b31, above the previous block to form the horizontal part of the "K". Use the `ab_drop()` function with block_type = 'b31' and an appropriate x_position that aligns the block center with the desired slot. Make sure the block is positioned in a stable way to prevent collapse.

4. Drop the third block, b13, above the previous block to extend the vertical part of the "K". Use the `ab_drop()` function with block_type = 'b13' and an appropriate x_position that aligns the block center with the desired slot. Again, ensure stability.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 to add another horizontal and vertical block to complete the "K" structure. Adjust the x_positions and layer heights as needed to achieve stability.

6. Once the structure is complete, check if it satisfies the constraint of no boundary intrusion. Iterate through the structure and count the number of 'x' blocks that are touching any boundary slot (0 or W-1). If the count is zero, the constraint is satisfied. Otherwise, adjust the block positions to minimize boundary intrusion.

7. Return the final structure and ensure it meets all the constraints.

This approach uses the provided `ab_drop()` function and follows the given constraints to generate a stable structure resembling the character "K".
