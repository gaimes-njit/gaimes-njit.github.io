To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "N" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function and follow the block-stacking problem techniques. Here is an approach to achieve the goal:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
   ```
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Start by dropping the 'b31' block at slot 3:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 3)
   ```

   This block will occupy slots 3, 4, and 5 in layer 0.

3. Drop the 'b31' block at slot 7:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 7)
   ```

   This block will occupy slots 7, 8, and 9 in layer 1.

4. Drop the 'b31' block at slot 11:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 11)
   ```

   This block will occupy slots 11, 12, and 13 in layer 2.

5. Drop the 'b11' block at slot 3:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 3)
   ```

   This block will occupy slot 3 in layer 3.

6. Drop the 'b11' block at slot 7:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 7)
   ```

   This block will occupy slot 7 in layer 4.

7. Drop the 'b13' block at slot 8:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 8)
   ```

   This block will occupy slots 8, 9, and 10 in layers 5, 6, and 7.

8. Drop the 'b11' block at slot 3:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 3)
   ```

   This block will occupy slot 3 in layer 8.

9. Drop the 'b11' block at slot 7:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 7)
   ```

   This block will occupy slot 7 in layer 9.

10. Drop the 'b31' block at slot 11:
    ```
    ab_drop('b31', 11)
    ```

    This block will occupy slots 11, 12, and 13 in layer 10.

11. Repeat steps 5-10 to create the right side of the "N" shape:
    - Drop the 'b31' block at slot 14.
    - Drop the 'b11' block at slot 14.
    - Drop the 'b13' block at slot 13.
    - Drop the 'b11' block at slot 17.
    - Drop the 'b11' block at slot 14.
    - Drop the 'b31' block at slot 11.

12. Repeat steps 5-11 to create the middle horizontal block of the "N" shape:
    - Drop the 'b31' block at slot 8.
    - Drop the 'b11' block at slot 7.
    - Drop the 'b31' block at slot 6.
    - Drop the 'b11' block at slot 7.
    - Drop the 'b31' block at slot 8.

13. After completing these steps, the structure will resemble the character "N" and will meet the stability constraint.

Note: This is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid configurations of blocks that meet the constraints.
