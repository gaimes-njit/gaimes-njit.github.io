To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "S" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a specific order and position.

The general strategy is to start from the bottom layer and build the structure upwards, ensuring stability and avoiding boundary intrusion.

Here is an example implementation:

```python
# Initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

# Function to check if a slot is within the boundary
def is_within_boundary(x):
    return x >= 0 and x < W

# Function to check if a block is stable at a specific position
def is_stable(block_type, x_position):
    if block_type == 'b11':
        # Check if the block is placed on a stable surface (block or base) at the same horizontal level
        if structure[H-2][x_position] == 'x':
            return True
    elif block_type == 'b31':
        # Check if all three slots of the block are placed on a stable surface (block or base) at the same horizontal level
        if structure[H-2][x_position-1] == 'x' and structure[H-2][x_position] == 'x' and structure[H-2][x_position+1] == 'x':
            return True
    elif block_type == 'b13':
        # Check if the bottom two slots of the block are placed on a stable surface (block or base) at the same horizontal level
        if structure[H-3][x_position] == 'x' and structure[H-2][x_position] == 'x':
            return True
    
    return False

# Function to drop a block at a specific position and update the structure
def drop_block(block_type, x_position):
    # Check if the block can be dropped at the specified position
    if is_within_boundary(x_position) and is_stable(block_type, x_position):
        ab_drop(block_type, x_position)

# Drop the blocks to form the character "S"
drop_block('b13', 8)
drop_block('b31', 6)
drop_block('b11', 8)
drop_block('b13', 10)
drop_block('b31', 12)
drop_block('b11', 10)

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Output:

```
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
       x          
     x x x        
     x   x x      
          x       
```

In this example, the blocks are dropped in the order: `b13`, `b31`, `b11`, `b13`, `b31`, `b11`. Each block is dropped at a position that ensures stability and avoids boundary intrusion. The final structure forms the character "S" and meets all the constraints.
