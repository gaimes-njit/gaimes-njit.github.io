To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "U" and meets all the constraints, you can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop blocks in the desired configuration.

Here is an algorithm to follow:
1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the given code snippet: `structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Start by dropping the base of the "U" structure. Since stability is crucial, drop a horizontal block (`b31`) in the middle slot (W/2) of the bottom layer (layer 0) using the `ab_drop()` function. This will create a stable base for the structure: `ab_drop('b31', W // 2)`.

3. To create the left vertical stroke of the "U," drop a vertical block (`b13`) one slot to the left of the middle slot, aligned with the bottom of the base (layer 1). This can be achieved by using the `ab_drop()` function with the appropriate parameters: `ab_drop('b13', (W // 2) - 1)`.

4. Drop another vertical block (`b13`) above the previously dropped block, also one slot to the left of the middle slot. Align it so that its bottom is at the same level as the top of the previous block (layer 4). Use the `ab_drop()` function with the appropriate parameters: `ab_drop('b13', (W // 2) - 1)`.

5. Move one slot to the right of the middle slot and repeat steps 3 and 4 to create the right vertical stroke of the "U."

6. Finally, drop a horizontal block (`b31`) at the top of the vertical strokes to complete the "U" shape. Align it so that its center is at the same slot as the middle slot of the base (W // 2). Use the `ab_drop()` function with the appropriate parameters: `ab_drop('b31', W // 2)`.

After following these steps, the `structure` grid will contain a stable structure that looks like the character "U" and meets all the given constraints.
