To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Y" and meets all the given constraints, we can follow these steps using the `ab_drop()` function:

1. Drop the base block (`b31`) at slot 9 using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`.
2. Drop the right vertical block (`b13`) at slot 10 using `ab_drop('b13', 10)`.
3. Drop the left vertical block (`b13`) at slot 8 using `ab_drop('b13', 8)`.

The resulting structure will look like the character "Y" and will meet the stability constraint as well as the no boundary intrusion constraint.
