Here is an example of using the 'ab drop()' function to generate a stable structure that looks like the letter "B":

```python
ab drop(b13, 9, H)
ab drop(b11, 8, H)
ab drop(b11, 7, H)
ab drop(b13, 6, H)

ab drop(b31, 5, H-1)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-2)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-3)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-4)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-5)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-6)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-7)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-8)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-9)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-10)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-11)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-12)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-13)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-14)
ab drop(b31, 5, H-15)
```

This code snippet will create a structure that resembles the letter "B" using the 'ab drop()' function. The blocks are strategically placed to form the shape of the letter "B", with the taller part on the left and the two shorter horizontal parts on the right. The order and position of the blocks are crucial to ensure a stable structure.
