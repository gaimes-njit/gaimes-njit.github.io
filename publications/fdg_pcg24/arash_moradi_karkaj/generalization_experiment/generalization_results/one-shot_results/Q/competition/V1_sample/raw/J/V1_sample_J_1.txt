4. Structure Generation
To generate a stable structure that looks like the letter "J," we can follow these steps:

- Start by dropping a b31 block centered at slot 10 from layer H-3.
- Drop a b13 block centered at slot 10 from layer H-2.
- Drop a b11 block at slot 9 from layer H-1.

By following these steps and adjusting the slot positions as needed, you can create a stable structure that resembles the letter "J" using the ‘ab drop()’ function.
