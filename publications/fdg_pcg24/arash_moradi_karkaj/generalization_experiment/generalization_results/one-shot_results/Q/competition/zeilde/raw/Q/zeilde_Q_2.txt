1. The letter "Q" with asterisks is drawn as follows:

```
 **** 
*    *
*    *
*    *
 **** 
    *
```

2. The asterisks and spaces generated in each row are as follows:

Row 1: 4 asterisks
Row 2: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 3: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 4: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 5: 4 asterisks
Row 6: 4 spaces, 1 asterisk

3. From now on, asterisks will be represented as "x" and spaces as "y". The new representation of the asterisks and spaces in each row is as follows:

Row 1: 4x
Row 2: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 3: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 4: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 5: 4x
Row 6: 4y, 1x

4. The side-by-side representation of the variables in each row becomes:

Row 1: "xxxx"
Row 2: "xxyxx"
Row 3: "xxyxx"
Row 4: "xxyxx"
Row 5: "xxxx"
Row 6: "yxxxx"

5. The position of each variable in each row is as follows:

Row 1: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4
Row 2: x-1; x-2; y-3; x-4; x-5
Row 3: x-1; x-2; y-3; x-4; x-5
Row 4: x-1; x-2; y-3; x-4; x-5
Row 5: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4
Row 6: y-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5

6. The sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
```
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
```
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
