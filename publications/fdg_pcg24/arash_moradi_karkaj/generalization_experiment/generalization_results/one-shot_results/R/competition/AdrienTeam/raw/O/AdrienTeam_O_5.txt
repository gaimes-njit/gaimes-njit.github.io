Here is the solution to generate the structure resembling "O" while satisfying all the constraints:

```
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the first block vertically at the center of the map
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop the next block to the left
ab_drop('b11', 7)

# Drop the next block to the right
ab_drop('b11', 11)

# Rotate 'L' to form the bottom layer of 'O'
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Place another 'L' on top of the previous one
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Place the final block on top to complete the structure
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

This set of `ab_drop()` inputs will create a stable structure resembling the letter "O" while adhering to all the specified constraints.
