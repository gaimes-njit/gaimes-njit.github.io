The structure of the "V" can be generated using the following `ab_drop()` calls:

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` calls will create a stable structure resembling the letter "V". The blocks are dropped in the specified order and position to satisfy the constraints and achieve the desired shape.
