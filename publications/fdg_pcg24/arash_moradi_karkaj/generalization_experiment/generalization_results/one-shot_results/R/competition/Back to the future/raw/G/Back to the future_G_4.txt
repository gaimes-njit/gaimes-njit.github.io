To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "G" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) upwards. Begin by dropping a b13 block centered at slot 3 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
The structure will now have a b13 block at coordinates (15, 3).

3. Next, drop a b31 block centered at slot 4 above the b13 block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
The structure will now have a b31 block at coordinates (14, 4).

4. Drop another b31 block centered at slot 4 above the previous b31 block to complete the base of the "G":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
The structure will now have a b31 block at coordinates (13, 4).

5. To create the upper part of the "G", drop a b11 block centered at slot 4 above the right side of the base:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```
The structure will now have a b11 block at coordinates (12, 4).

6. Finally, drop a b13 block centered at slot 4 above the b11 block to complete the shape of the "G":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```
The structure will now have a b13 block at coordinates (11, 4).

The final structure will resemble the uppercase character "G".

It is important to note that the above code only describes the sequence of `ab_drop()` function calls to form the "G" shape. Additional code may be needed to handle stability checks, constraints, and ensure the entire structure meets the goal while satisfying all the hard constraints.
