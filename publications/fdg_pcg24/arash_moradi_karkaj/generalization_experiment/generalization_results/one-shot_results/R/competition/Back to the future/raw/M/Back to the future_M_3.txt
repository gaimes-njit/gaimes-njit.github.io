To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "M", we can use the `ab_drop()` function in a systematic way. Here is a high-level outline of the steps we can follow:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided `structure` variable.
2. Generate the left vertical part of the "M":
   a. Use `ab_drop('b13', y)` to drop a vertical block at a suitable slot and store the coordinates of the drop.
   b. Repeat step a twice more, adjusting the slot position, to create three vertically stacked blocks.
3. Generate the middle horizontal part of the "M":
   a. Use `ab_drop('b31', y)` to drop a horizontal block at a suitable slot and store the coordinates of the drop.
   b. Replicate step a twice more, adjusting the slot position, to create three horizontally stacked blocks.
4. Generate the right vertical part of the "M":
   a. Use `ab_drop('b13', y)` to drop a vertical block at a suitable slot and store the coordinates of the drop.
   b. Repeat step a twice more, adjusting the slot position, to create three vertically stacked blocks.
5. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure that it remains stable and does not collapse.
6. Adjust the slot positions in each drop to satisfy the constraint of not intruding on the boundary of the map.
7. Ensure that the overall shape of the structure resembles the "M" by arranging the drops appropriately.
8. Randomize the order of the drops to promote diversity in the generated structures.

This outline provides a general approach, but the specific implementation will require fine-tuning and experimentation to generate stable structures that closely resemble the desired "M" shape.
