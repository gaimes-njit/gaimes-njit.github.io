To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Z" and meets all the hard constraints using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the following code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base block (b31) at the bottom layer (0) and its center aligned at slot 6 using the `ab_drop()` function:
```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```
This ensures the stable foundation for the structure.

3. Place the vertical blocks (b13) on top of the base block to form the vertical stroke of the "Z" shape. The first vertical block will be placed at layer 1 and its center aligned at slot 6:
```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

4. Place the second vertical block at layer 2 and its center aligned at slot 6:
```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

5. Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the second vertical block to form the horizontal stroke of the "Z" shape. The horizontal block will be placed at layer 2 and its center aligned at slot 3:
```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

6. Place the third vertical block on top of the horizontal block to complete the vertical stroke of the "Z" shape. The third vertical block will be placed at layer 3 and its center aligned at slot 3:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

7. Finally, place the horizontal block on top of the third vertical block to complete the horizontal stroke of the "Z" shape. The horizontal block will be placed at layer 3 and its center aligned at slot 0:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

The resulting structure will be a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Z" and meets all the hard constraints.
