To generate a stable structure that looks like the capital English letter "F", we can use the following series of `ab_drop()` function calls:

1. Place blocks at the bottom to form the base of the letter "F":
   - `ab_drop('b31', 9)` - Drop a horizontal block ('b31') at slot 9 to form the base of the letter "F".

2. Place blocks vertically to form the two vertical lines of the letter "F":
   - `ab_drop('b13', 5)` - Drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 5 to form the left vertical line of the letter "F".
   - `ab_drop('b13', 13)` - Drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 13 to form the right vertical line of the letter "F".

3. Place blocks horizontally to form the horizontal line of the letter "F":
   - `ab_drop('b31', 9)` - Drop a horizontal block ('b31') at slot 9 to form the horizontal line of the letter "F".

Final code:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 13)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
