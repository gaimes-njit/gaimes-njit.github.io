We can approach this problem by breaking down the shape of the letter "M" into smaller parts and using the ab_drop() function to drop these parts in the desired order.

1. First, let's drop the two side vertical blocks ('b13') at slots 3 and 16, respectively, to form the two outer legs of the "M":
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 16)

2. Next, we can drop a horizontal block ('b31') at slot 10 to connect the two outer legs:
ab_drop('b31', 10)

3. To add stability to the structure, let's drop a square block ('b11') at slot 10, on top of the horizontal block:
ab_drop('b11', 10)

4. Finally, let's drop two more vertical blocks ('b13') at slots 5 and 14, respectively, to form the two inner legs of the "M":
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 14)

Here is the resulting code using the ab_drop() function:
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 16)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 14)
