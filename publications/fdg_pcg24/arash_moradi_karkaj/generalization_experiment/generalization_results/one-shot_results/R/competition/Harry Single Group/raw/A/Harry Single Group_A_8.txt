To form the shape resembling the letter "A", we can use the following steps:

1. Initialize the field by representing it as a 2D list with 16 rows and 20 columns, filled with zeros to signify empty cells.

```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Place the base of the letter "A" using a horizontal brick of length 3 (b31) on the ground.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Place the top-left and top-right branches of the letter "A" using vertical bricks of height 3 (b13). To ensure stability, we need to place the bricks in a way that the pivot point has an equal number of occupied cells on its left and right sides.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
```

4. To complete the shape of the "A", we need to fill the empty cells between the top-left and top-right branches. We can do this by placing individual bricks of length 1 (b11) in the appropriate positions.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 14)
```

5. Finally, print the resulting field to visually see the shape resembling the letter "A".

```python
for row in field:
    print(row)
```

The complete code, including the function calls, should look like this:

```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 14)

for row in field:
    print(row)
```

When you run this code, you will see the 2D representation of the field with the shape resembling the letter "A".
