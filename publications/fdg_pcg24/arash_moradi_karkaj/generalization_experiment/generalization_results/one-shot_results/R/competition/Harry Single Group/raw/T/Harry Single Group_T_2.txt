Here is an example code that generates the required structure resembling the letter "T" while satisfying the important notes:

```
# map initialization
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

def check_stability():
    for y in range(1, 16):
        for x in range(19):
            if field[y][x] != 0:
                if (field[y][x-1] != 0 and field[y][x+1] == 0) or (field[y][x-1] == 0 and field[y][x+1] != 0):
                    return False
    return True

# ab_drop function
def ab_drop(x, y):
    if x == 'b31':
        x_length = 3
        y_length = 1
        brick = [[1 for _ in range(x_length)] for _ in  range(y_length)]
    elif x == 'b13':
        x_length = 1
        y_length = 3
        brick = [[1 for _ in range(x_length)] for _ in  range(y_length)]
    elif x == 'b11':
        x_length = 1
        y_length = 1
        brick = [[1 for _ in range(x_length)] for _ in  range(y_length)]
    
    for i in range(x_length):
        for j in range(y_length):
            if y+j < 16:
                if field[y+j][y+i] != 0:
                    return

    for i in range(x_length):
        for j in range(y_length):
            field[y+j][y+i] = brick[j][i]
    
    # Check stability
    if not check_stability():
        for i in range(x_length):
            for j in range(y_length):
                field[y+j][y+i] = 0


# Generate the required structure
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Print the final field
for row in field:
    print(row)
```

The code initializes the field with zeros and defines a check_stability() function to ensure stability of placed bricks. The ab_drop function uses if-elif statements to determine the type of brick and creates the brick accordingly. It then checks if the current position of the brick is already occupied or if it exceeds the boundaries of the field. If not, it updates the field with the current brick. After placing each brick, it checks for stability and removes the brick if it is unstable. Finally, the code generates the required structure by calling the ab_drop function with the appropriate parameters and prints the final field.

Note: This code is just an example and may need to be modified or optimized based on specific requirements or constraints.
