To create a structure exactly like "C" using the given block types and ab_drop command, you can follow these steps:

1. Create the outer frame of the "C" using the b31 block type, with a width of 3 and a height of 16. Start at position (0, 0) and drop the block using the ab_drop('b31', 0) command.

2. Create the horizontal part of the "C" using the b13 block type, with a width of 1 and a height of 13. Start at position (1, 3) and drop the block using the ab_drop('b13', 1) command.

3. Create the vertical part of the "C" using the b13 block type, with a width of 1 and a height of 10. Start at position (4, 0) and drop the block using the ab_drop('b13', 4) command.

Here's the complete code:

ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)

This will create the structure exactly like "C" inside a 20*16 box.
