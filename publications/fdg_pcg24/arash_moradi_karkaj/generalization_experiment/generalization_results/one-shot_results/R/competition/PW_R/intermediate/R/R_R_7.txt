The answer is missing the ab_drop() commands to construct the letter "R". Here is an example of how to generate the letter "R" using the given block types and rules:

```
ab_drop(b31,1) // Place the first block of type b31 at position 1
ab_drop(b31,2) // Place the second block of type b31 at position 2
ab_drop(b31,3) // Place the third block of type b31 at position 3
ab_drop(b13,1) // Place the fourth block of type b13 at position 1
ab_drop(b11,2) // Place the fifth block of type b11 at position 2
ab_drop(b11,3) // Place the sixth block of type b11 at position 3
ab_drop(b11,4) // Place the seventh block of type b11 at position 4
ab_drop(b11,5) // Place the eighth block of type b11 at position 5
ab_drop(b11,6) // Place the ninth block of type b11 at position 6
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "R" within the allowed space and in accordance with the gravity rules.
