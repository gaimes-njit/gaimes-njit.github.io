To generate the uppercase letter "C", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop(31, 1)
ab_drop(31, 4)
ab_drop(31, 7)
ab_drop(31, 10)
ab_drop(31, 13)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
ab_drop(13, 16)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "C" using the block types provided, while ensuring that the structure is stable according to the gravity rules.
