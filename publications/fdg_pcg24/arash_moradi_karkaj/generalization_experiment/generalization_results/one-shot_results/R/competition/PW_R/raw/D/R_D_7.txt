Explanation: 
1. Start by placing a vertical straight block at position (1,1).
2. Place a square block next to it at position (1,2) to form the top-left corner of the letter 'D'.
3. Place another square block next to it at position (2,2) to form the vertical line of the 'D'.
4. Place a horizontal straight block below the two squares at position (1,3) to form the top of the letter 'D'.
5. Place another horizontal straight block next to it at position (2,3) to complete the top of the letter 'D'.
6. Place a square block next to the horizontal straight blocks at position (3,3) to form the bottom right corner of the 'D'.
7. Place a vertical straight block next to the square block at position (2,4) to extend the vertical line of the 'D'.
8. Place a square block next to it at position (2,5) to complete the vertical line of the 'D'.
9. Place another square block next to it at position (3,5) to form the bottom-left corner of the 'D'.
