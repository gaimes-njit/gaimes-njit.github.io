To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "F" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and fitting within the allowed space boundaries.
