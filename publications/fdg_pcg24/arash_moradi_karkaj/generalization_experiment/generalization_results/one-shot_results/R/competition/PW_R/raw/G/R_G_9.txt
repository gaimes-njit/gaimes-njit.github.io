To generate the uppercase letter "G", we need to carefully place the blocks in a specific arrangement. Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands that will generate the letter "G":

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a 1x1 block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 2)  # Place a 1x1 block at position 2
ab_drop("b11", 3)  # Place a 1x1 block at position 3
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 3)  # Place a 1x1 block at position 3
ab_drop("b13", 3)  # Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 3
ab_drop("b11", 3)  # Place a 1x1 block at position 3
ab_drop("b11", 2)  # Place a 1x1 block at position 2
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 3)  # Place a 1x1 block at position 3
ab_drop("b11", 2)  # Place a 1x1 block at position 2
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1
```

By executing these commands in the given environment with 2D gravity rules, the resulting arrangement of blocks will form the uppercase letter "G" accurately within the boundaries.
