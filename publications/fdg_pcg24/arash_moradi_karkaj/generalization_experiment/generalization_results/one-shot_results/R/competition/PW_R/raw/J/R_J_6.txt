To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we can use the block types b31 and b13. Here is the stream of commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable structure in the shape of a letter "J" within the allowed space boundaries.
