```
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 4)  # Place square block at position 4
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Place vertical block at position 4
ab_drop("b11", 5)  # Place square block at position 5
ab_drop("b11", 6)  # Place square block at position 6
```
This will create the letter "L" in the Tetris-like environment.
