```
ab_drop("b13",1)
ab_drop("b11",2)
ab_drop("b13",3)
ab_drop("b13",5)
ab_drop("b11",6)
ab_drop("b13",7)
```
In this example, we create the letter 'R':  
- The vertical straight block 'b13' is placed at position 1 to form the slanted part on the left side of the letter.  
- The 1x1 square block 'b11' is placed at position 2 to form the top part of the letter.  
- Another vertical straight block 'b13' is placed at position 3 to form the slanted part on the right side of the letter.  
- The slanted part on the right side of the letter is left empty.  
- The 1x1 square block 'b11' is placed at position 6 to form the bottom left part of the letter.  
- Another vertical straight block 'b13' is placed at position 7 to form the bottom right part of the letter.
