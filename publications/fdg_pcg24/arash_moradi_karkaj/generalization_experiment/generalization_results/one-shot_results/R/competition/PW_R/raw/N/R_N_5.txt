To generate the uppercase English letter "N", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 13)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by dropping a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1 to form the left side of the letter "N".
2. Next, we drop a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 5 to connect the left side with the middle part of the letter.
3. We repeat step 2 by dropping another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 9.
4. Finally, we drop another vertical straight block ('b13') at position 13 to complete the right side of the letter "N".

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase English letter "N" in the Tetris-like environment.
