The target letter is "P". Here is a stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "P":

```
ab_drop(b31, 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1 (bottom left)
ab_drop(b31, 2)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2 (right of the first block)
ab_drop(b13, 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1 (above the horizontal blocks)
ab_drop(b11, 1)  # Place a square block at position 1 (above the vertical block)
ab_drop(b11, 2)  # Place a square block at position 2 (right of the first square block)
ab_drop(b11, 3)  # Place a square block at position 3 (right of the second square block)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "P" within the allowed space boundaries.
