To generate the uppercase letter "Q" in the grid, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 16)
ab_drop('b13', 13)
```

This series of commands will create the letter "Q" by stacking and arranging the block types according to the defined environment.
