To generate the uppercase English letter "S" using the ab_drop() command and the block types provided, we need to carefully place the blocks in a way that resembles the letter. Here is an example of how we can achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block starting from position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block starting from position 1, below the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place another horizontal straight block starting from position 4, creating the top part of the letter
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place another vertical straight block starting from position 4, below the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place another horizontal straight block starting from position 7, creating the bottom part of the letter
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place another vertical straight block starting from position 7, below the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Place another horizontal straight block starting from position 10, creating the middle part of the letter
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Place another vertical straight block starting from position 10, below the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 13)  # Place another horizontal straight block starting from position 13, creating the top part of the second curve
ab_drop('b13', 13)  # Place another vertical straight block starting from position 13, below the previous block
ab_drop('b31', 16)  # Place another horizontal straight block starting from position 16, creating the bottom part of the second curve
ab_drop('b13', 16)  # Place another vertical straight block starting from position 16, below the previous block
```

By following these commands in a Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules, we can create the uppercase letter "S".
