To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4.
3. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 7.

This arrangement of blocks resembles the letter "V" and satisfies the gravity rules in the defined environment.
