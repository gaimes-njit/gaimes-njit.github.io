To generate the uppercase letter "V," you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop(31, 1)
ab_drop(13, 1)
ab_drop(31, 2)
ab_drop(13, 2)
ab_drop(31, 3)
ab_drop(13, 3)
ab_drop(31, 4)
ab_drop(13, 4)
ab_drop(31, 5)
ab_drop(13, 5)
```

This sequence of commands will create a capital "V" shape using the block types b31 and b13. Each ab_drop() command places a block of the specified type at the given position along the width.
