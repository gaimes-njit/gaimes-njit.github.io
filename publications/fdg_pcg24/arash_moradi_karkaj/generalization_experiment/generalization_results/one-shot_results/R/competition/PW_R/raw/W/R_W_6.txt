There are different ways to generate the letter "W" using the given block types and gravity rules. Here is one possible solution:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',7)
ab_drop('b13',10)
ab_drop('b11',13)
ab_drop('b13',14)
ab_drop('b31',17)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "W" in the grid, using the block types "b31" and "b13" where necessary.
