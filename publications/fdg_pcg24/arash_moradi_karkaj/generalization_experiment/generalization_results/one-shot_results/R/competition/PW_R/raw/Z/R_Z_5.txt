```
ab_drop("b31", 1)    # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 4)    # Place a vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop("b31", 7)    # Place a horizontal straight block at position 7
ab_drop("b13", 10)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 10
ab_drop("b31", 13)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 13
```

This will generate the letter "Z" by stacking the blocks in the order mentioned above.
