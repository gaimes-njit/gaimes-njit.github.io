To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "B" using the ab_drop() python function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.
2. Place a b31 block on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) at the bottom layer (layer 0) and choose a suitable slot number for its center alignment.
   - Use the ab_drop() function with x=b31 and y=10 (or any suitable slot number) to vertically drop the block.
   - Update the structure grid with the dropped block.
3. Place two b13 blocks vertically above the b31 block to form the two vertical lines of the "B" character.
   - Use the ab_drop() function with x=b13 and y=9 and x=b13 and y=11 (or any suitable slot numbers) to vertically drop the blocks.
   - Update the structure grid with the dropped blocks.
4. Place a b31 block horizontally above the two vertical lines to connect them and complete the top part of the "B" character.
   - Use the ab_drop() function with x=b31 and y=10 (or any suitable slot number) to vertically drop the block.
   - Update the structure grid with the dropped block.

The resulting structure will resemble the character "B" and meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is an example of the code:

```python
W = 20  # Width of the map
H = 16  # Height of the map

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Place a b31 block on the solid base
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Place two b13 blocks vertically above the b31 block
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)

# Place a b31 block horizontally above the two vertical lines
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "B" while meeting all the hard constraints.
