To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all the hard constraints and following the given step-by-step instructions, we can proceed as follows:

Step 1: Initialize the structure
Initialize the structure as an empty grid with a width (W) of 20 slots and a height (H) of 16 layers. Use the provided code:

```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place b31 block as the base
To meet the stability constraint, we need to place a b31 block as the base. This block should be placed on the solid base layer (layer 0). We will choose slot 8 as the center for this block. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the b31 block at position (0, 8):

```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

Step 3: Place the vertical parts of the "F"
Next, we need to place two b13 blocks as the vertical parts of the "F". These blocks should be placed on top of the b31 block, maintaining stability. We will choose slots 7 and 9 as the centers for these blocks. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the b13 blocks at positions (1, 7) and (1, 9):

```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal part of the "F"
Finally, we need to place a b31 block as the horizontal part of the "F". This block should be placed on top of the vertical b13 blocks, maintaining stability. We will choose slot 9 as the center for this block. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the b31 block at position (4, 9):

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 5: Print the resulting structure
To visualize the resulting structure, print the `structure` grid using nested loops:

```
for layer in structure:
    print(' '.join(layer))
```

This will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all hard constraints.

Note: The specific placement of blocks may vary depending on the starting positions and order of the previous drops. The example provided above is just one possible arrangement that meets the given requirements.
