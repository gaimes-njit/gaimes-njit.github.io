To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "G" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet.
2. Place the b31 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and centered in the middle slot (slot 10) using the ab_drop() function.
   - ab_drop("b31", 10)
3. Place two b11 blocks on top of the b31 block in the left and right slots to form the horizontal bar of the "G" shape.
   - ab_drop("b11", 9)  # Left block
   - ab_drop("b11", 11)  # Right block
4. Place a b13 block above the left b11 block to form the left vertical part of the "G" shape.
   - ab_drop("b13", 9)
5. Place a b13 block above the right b11 block to form the right vertical part of the "G" shape.
   - ab_drop("b13", 11)
6. Place a b11 block above the left b13 block to form the top horizontal part of the "G" shape.
   - ab_drop("b11", 9)
7. Place a b11 block above the right b13 block to form the top horizontal part of the "G" shape.
   - ab_drop("b11", 11)

The resulting structure should resemble the character "G" when viewed on the grid.
