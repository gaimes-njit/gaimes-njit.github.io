To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "J" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
W = 20  # width of the map
H = 16  # height of the map
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping positions and order of the blocks using techniques from the block-stacking problem. In this case, we can start by dropping a b11 block at the leftmost slot (slot 0) and the bottom layer (layer 0) to form the base:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 1 on layer 0 to support the b11 block and prevent overhangs:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

4. Drop a b31 block at slot 1 on layer 1 to support the b13 block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

5. Drop a b11 block at slot 2 on layer 0 to join the base and complete the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

6. The resulting structure will resemble the character "J". Note that this is just an example and you can experiment with different dropping positions and orders to achieve a stable structure that resembles the character "J".

Here is the code that generates the stable structure resembling the character "J":

```python
W = 20  # width of the map
H = 16  # height of the map
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

You can modify the dropping positions and orders to generate different structures resembling the character "J" while meeting all the given requirements.
