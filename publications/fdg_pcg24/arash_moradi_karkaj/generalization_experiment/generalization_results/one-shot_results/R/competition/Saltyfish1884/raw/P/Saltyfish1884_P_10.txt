To generate a structure that resembles the character "P" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the given code snippet:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the lower part of the letter "P" (b31 block) on the solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block in the appropriate slot and ensure stability.

3. Place the vertical part of the letter "P" (b13 block) on top of the lower part. Again, use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block in the appropriate slot and ensure stability.

4. Place the top part of the letter "P" (b31 block) on top of the vertical part. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block in the appropriate slot and ensure stability.

5. Avoid any boundary intrusion. Ensure that the blocks do not intrude on the map's boundary, both W and H. Adjust the dropping positions and order if necessary to meet this constraint.

6. After placing all the blocks, the final structure will resemble the character "P". Print the structure to verify the result.

Note: The specific dropping positions and order will depend on the desired shape and size of the "P" character. Experiment with different positions and orders to achieve the best result.
