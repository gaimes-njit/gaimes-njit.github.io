To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "P" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps using the ab_drop() function:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.
2. Start by dropping a b11 block in slots 0 and 1 on layer 0. This will serve as the base for the structure.
3. Drop a b31 block on top of the b11 block, aligning its center with the center of the b11 block. This will form the vertical part of the "P".
4. Drop another b11 block on the leftmost slot of layer 2, aligning its center with the center of the b31 block. This will form the horizontal part of the "P".
5. Repeat step 4 by dropping b11 blocks on slots 1 and 2 of layer 4, aligning their centers with the center of the previous b11 block. This will extend the horizontal part of the "P".
6. Drop a b13 block on the rightmost slot of layer 1, aligning its center with the center of the b31 block. This will form the vertical extension of the "P".
7. Drop a b11 block on the slot next to the b13 block, aligning its center with the center of the b13 block. This will complete the horizontal part of the "P".
8. Drop a b11 block on the leftmost slot of layer 3, aligning its center with the center of the previous b11 block. This will extend the horizontal part of the "P".
9. Drop a b11 block on the slot next to the previous b11 block, aligning its center with the center of the previous b11 block. This will complete the vertical part of the "P".
10. Finally, drop a b11 block on the slot below the previous b11 block, aligning its center with the center of the previous b11 block. This will complete the structure of the "P".

The resulting structure will resemble the character "P" and meet all the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
