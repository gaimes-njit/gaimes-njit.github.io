To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WÃ—H using the provided code:

```python
W = 20  # map width
H = 16  # map height
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. We'll begin by placing the base of the "R" shape, which is a b11 block. We must place it at the bottom layer (layer 0) and align its center with an appropriate slot (e.g., slot 9):

```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

3. Next, we'll place the vertical portion of the "R" shape, which consists of two b13 blocks. We'll place them on either side of the base block. Again, we need to ensure stability, so we'll place them in slots along the sides of the base block:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

4. Finally, we'll place the horizontal portion of the "R" shape, which is a b31 block. We need to ensure stability, so we'll place it on top of the base block:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

The above steps will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" and meets all the hard constraints.

Please note that the above code assumes that the `ab_drop()` function is already defined and accessible.
