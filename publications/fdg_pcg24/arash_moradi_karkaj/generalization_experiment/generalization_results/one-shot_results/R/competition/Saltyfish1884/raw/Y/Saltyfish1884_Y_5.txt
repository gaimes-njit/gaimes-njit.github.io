To generate a stable structure resembling the character "Y" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully determine the dropping positions and order of the blocks using the ab_drop() function. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. Initialize the structure grid as an empty WxH grid using the provided code.

2. Start by dropping a b11 block at the center slot (slot 10) and the bottom layer (layer 0) using the ab_drop(0, 10) function. This block will serve as the base of the "Y" structure.

3. Drop a b31 block above the base block, aligned with its center at slot 10. This block will form the vertical stem of the "Y" structure. Use the ab_drop(1, 10) function to drop this block.

4. Drop two more b31 blocks on both sides of the vertical stem, aligned with their centers at slots 7 and 13. These blocks will form the arms of the "Y" structure. Use the ab_drop(1, 7) and ab_drop(1, 13) functions to drop these blocks.

5. Drop a b13 block above the top of the vertical stem, aligned with its center at slot 10. This block will form the top branch of the "Y" structure. Use the ab_drop(2, 10) function to drop this block.

6. The resulting structure should resemble the character "Y" and meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. You can visualize the structure by printing the contents of the 'structure' variable.

The final code should look like this:

```python
W = 20
H = 16

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Step 1: Drop the base block (b11) at the bottom center
ab_drop(0, 10)

# Step 2: Drop the vertical stem (b31) above the base
ab_drop(1, 10)

# Step 3: Drop the arms (b31) on both sides of the vertical stem
ab_drop(1, 7)
ab_drop(1, 13)

# Step 4: Drop the top branch (b13) above the vertical stem
ab_drop(2, 10)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This code will generate a stable structure resembling the character "Y" while meeting all the given requirements.
