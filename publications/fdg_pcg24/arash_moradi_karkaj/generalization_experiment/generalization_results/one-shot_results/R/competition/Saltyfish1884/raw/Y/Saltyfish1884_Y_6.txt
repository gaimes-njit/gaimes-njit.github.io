To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Y" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks at the bottom of the structure to form a stable foundation:
```python
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop("b11", i)
```

3. Position the blocks to form the two diagonal arms of the "Y" character:
```python
# Place the left arm
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

# Place the right arm
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```

4. Position the block to form the vertical stem of the "Y" character:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

5. To meet constraint 5.2 (no boundary intrusion), we can adjust the position of the blocks so that they do not intrude on the map's boundary. For example, we can slightly shift the blocks to the left or right.

6. The final structure should resemble the character "Y":
```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Please note that the specific positions mentioned in the steps above might need adjustment based on the desired placement and stability of the structure.
