To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Z" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) at the bottom layer of the structure to create a solid base. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the blocks at the appropriate slots.
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

3. Place the b31 block on top of the base blocks, aligned with the bottom-left corner of the structure. This will be the left diagonal of the "Z" shape.
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

4. Place another b31 block on top of the previous one, aligned with the bottom-right corner of the structure. This will be the right diagonal of the "Z" shape.
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

5. Place the top block (b11) on top of the b31 blocks, aligned with the center slot. This will complete the "Z" shape.
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

6. The final structure will resemble the character "Z" and meet all the given constraints.

Note: The exact slot positions and order of dropping the blocks may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints.
