To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "V", we can break it down into three components: the left slanting line, the right slanting line, and the middle bar. We will start building from the bottom to the top.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Drop the left slanting line
ab_drop("b13", 6)  # Place the first block of the left slanting line at x_position=6
ab_drop("b13", 7)  # Place the second block of the left slanting line at x_position=7
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Place the third block of the left slanting line at x_position=8

# Drop the right slanting line
ab_drop("b13", 11)  # Place the first block of the right slanting line at x_position=11
ab_drop("b13", 12)  # Place the second block of the right slanting line at x_position=12
ab_drop("b13", 13)  # Place the third block of the right slanting line at x_position=13

# Drop the middle bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the first block of the middle bar at x_position=9
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Place the second block of the middle bar at x_position=10
```

This implementation starts by dropping the left slanting line blocks from left to right (x_position 6, 7, and 8). Then, it drops the right slanting line blocks from left to right (x_position 11, 12, and 13). Finally, it drops the middle bar blocks from left to right (x_position 9 and 10).

This implementation ensures that the blocks are well-supported and balanced, meeting the stability constraint. It also generates a structure that resembles the letter "V" when viewed from the top-down orientation, satisfying the similarity constraint.
