To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "D" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function iteratively to drop different block types in a specific order. Here's how we can approach it:

1. First, we need to drop a `b31` block horizontally at the bottom layer (layer 0). This will form the base of the "D" structure. We can use the `ab_drop('b31', x)` function to drop the block at slot `x` on the bottom layer. Choose the slot `x` such that the block is centered horizontally and does not intrude on the boundary of the map.

2. Next, we need to drop a `b13` block vertically above the base block. This will form the vertical stem of the "D" structure. We can use the `ab_drop('b13', x)` function to drop the block at slot `x` above the base block. Again, choose the slot `x` to ensure the block is centered horizontally and does not intrude on the boundary.

3. Finally, we need to drop a `b31` block horizontally at the top layer (layer 15) to form the curved part of the "D" structure. We can use the `ab_drop('b31', x)` function to drop the block at slot `x` on the top layer. Choose the slot `x` to center the block horizontally and avoid boundary intrusion.

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "D" and satisfies all the constraints.
