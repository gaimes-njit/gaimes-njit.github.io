To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "D" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop the blocks in a way that satisfies the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints. Here is a possible solution:

1. Drop the first b11 block at slot 1 to create the vertical stroke of the "D":
   `ab_drop('b11', 1)`

2. Drop the second b31 block at slot 2 to create the curved stroke of the "D":
   `ab_drop('b31', 2)`

3. Drop the b13 block at slot 3 to complete the curved stroke of the "D":
   `ab_drop('b13', 3)`

This sequence of block drops ensures stability by starting with the bottom blocks first and stacking them in a balanced manner. It also avoids any boundary intrusion, as all the blocks are placed within the map's width limits.

After executing these steps, the `structure` grid will represent the stable structure that looks like the character "D".
