To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "D" using the `ab_drop()` function and satisfy the given constraints, the following steps can be taken:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b13 vertical block at the bottom-left corner (slot 0, layer 0):
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```
This will create the bottom straight part of the "D" character.

3. Drop the b31 horizontal block above the previously dropped block, slightly offset to the right (slot 1, layer 1):
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will create the curved part of the "D" character.

4. Drop the b31 horizontal block above the previously dropped block, aligned with the first block (slot 1, layer 2):
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will complete the curved part of the "D" character.

5. Drop the b31 horizontal block above the previously dropped block, aligned with the first block (slot 1, layer 3):
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will create the straight vertical part of the "D" character.

6. Drop the b31 horizontal block above the previously dropped block, aligned with the first block (slot 1, layer 4):
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
This will complete the straight vertical part of the "D" character.

7. Drop the b11 square block above the previously dropped block, aligned with the first block (slot 1, layer 5):
```python
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```
This will create the small top part of the "D" character.

8. The resulting structure will resemble the character "D" and meet all the constraints.

Note: The above steps assume that the `ab_drop()` function is correctly implemented and handles stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
