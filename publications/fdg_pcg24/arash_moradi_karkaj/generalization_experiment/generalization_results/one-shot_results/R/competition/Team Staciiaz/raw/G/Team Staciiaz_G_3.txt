To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "G" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is an example solution:

```python
# Initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the blocks to form the "G" shape
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Drop a horizontal block at slot 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Drop a horizontal block at slot 5
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Drop a horizontal block at slot 6
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Drop a square block at slot 6
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Drop a square block at slot 7
ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Drop a horizontal block at slot 8
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop a square block at slot 9
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop a vertical block at slot 9
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Drop a square block at slot 10
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Drop a vertical block at slot 10
ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Drop a vertical block at slot 11

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This solution will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "G" while satisfying all the constraints. The blocks are dropped in a way that ensures stability, and there is no intrusion on the map boundary.
