To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully drop the blocks in a specific order and position to satisfy the stability constraint and avoid boundary intrusion.

Here is the step-by-step process to generate the structure:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided `structure` initialization code.

2. Drop a **b11** block at slot 0 using `ab_drop('b11', 0)`. This block will serve as the base.

3. Drop a **b31** block at slot 0 using `ab_drop('b31', 0)`. This block will be placed on top of the base block horizontally.

4. Drop a **b31** block at slot 0 using `ab_drop('b31', 0)`. This block will be placed on top of the previous block horizontally.

5. Drop a **b31** block at slot 0 using `ab_drop('b31', 0)`. This block will be placed on top of the previous block horizontally.

6. Drop a **b13** block at slot 3 using `ab_drop('b13', 3)`. This block will be placed on top of the previous blocks vertically to form the vertical part of the "L" shape.

7. Drop a **b11** block at slot 3 using `ab_drop('b11', 3)`. This block will be placed on top of the previous block to complete the vertical part of the "L" shape.

8. The structure is now complete and should resemble the character "L". The resulting grid can be accessed using the `structure` variable.

Make sure to follow the dropping order and positions exactly as mentioned above to generate a stable structure that meets all the constraints.
