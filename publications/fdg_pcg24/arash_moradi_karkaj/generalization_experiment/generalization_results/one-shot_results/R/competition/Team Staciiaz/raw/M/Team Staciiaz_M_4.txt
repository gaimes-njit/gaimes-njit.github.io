To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "M" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks at specific positions.

Here's one approach to generate the structure:

1. First, we need to create a stable base by dropping two `b31` blocks at slots 5 and 14, aligned to the bottom layer (layer 0). This will form the base of our structure.

```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

2. Next, we can drop the two side arms of the "M" shape. For each side arm, we will drop a `b13` block at the corresponding slot number, aligned to the top of the base (layer 1). The slot numbers for the side arms are 1 and 18.

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 18)
```

3. Finally, we can drop the middle part of the "M" shape. We will drop two `b31` blocks and one `b11` block to form the middle part. The `b31` blocks will be aligned to the top of the base (layer 2), and the `b11` block will be aligned to the top of the side arms (layer 3). The slot numbers for the middle part are 8, 11, and 15.

```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 15)
```

After executing these steps, the `structure` will represent the stable structure that looks like the character "M".

Note: The order in which blocks are dropped is important for stability. By starting from the base and building upwards, we ensure that the weight distribution is optimal for stability.
