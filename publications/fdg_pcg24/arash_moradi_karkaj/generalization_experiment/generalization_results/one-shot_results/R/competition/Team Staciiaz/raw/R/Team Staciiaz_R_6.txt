To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "R" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid of size WxH.
2. Drop the b31 block at slot 2 using the `ab_drop()` function. This will create the vertical line of the "R".
3. Drop the b13 block at slot 1 using the `ab_drop()` function. This will create the top-right diagonal of the "R".
4. Drop the b31 block at slot 5 using the `ab_drop()` function. This will create the horizontal line of the "R".
5. Drop the b13 block at slot 3 using the `ab_drop()` function. This will create the bottom-right diagonal of the "R".
6. Drop the b13 block at slot 0 using the `ab_drop()` function. This will create the vertical line on the left side of the "R".

By following these steps, the structure will resemble the character "R" and meet both the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints.
