In order to generate a stable structure that looks like the character "S" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the first block 'b13' at the bottom layer (layer 0) and at the center slot (W/2).
```
ab_drop('b13', W/2)
```

3. This block will serve as the base for the 'S' structure.

4. Drop the next block 'b31' above the base block, at the left slot of the base block's center.
```
ab_drop('b31', W/2 - 1)
```

5. Drop another 'b31' block above the previous block, at the right slot of the base block's center.
```
ab_drop('b31', W/2 + 1)
```

6. Drop a 'b11' block above the right 'b31' block, at the right slot of the previous 'b31' block's center.
```
ab_drop('b11', W/2 + 1)
```

7. Drop another 'b11' block above the left 'b31' block, at the left slot of the previous 'b31' block's center.
```
ab_drop('b11', W/2 - 1)
```

8. The resulting structure should resemble the character "S" and meet all the constraints.

By following these steps, we ensure stability by carefully placing the blocks and avoid boundary intrusion by keeping the blocks within the map boundaries.
