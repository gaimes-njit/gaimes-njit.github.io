To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "T" and meets all the constraints, the `ab_drop()` function can be used as follows:

```python
def generate_structure():
    # initializing the structure as an empty grid
    W = 20
    H = 16
    structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

    # drop base blocks at the bottom layer to provide stability
    for slot in range(8, 13):
        ab_drop('b31', slot)

    # drop blocks for the vertical part of the "T"
    for layer in range(1, 14):
        ab_drop('b13', 10)

    # drop blocks for the horizontal part of the "T"
    for slot in range(6, 15):
        ab_drop('b31', slot)

    return structure

# Generate the structure
structure = generate_structure()

# Print the structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This code will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "T" and satisfies all the constraints. The base blocks are dropped first to provide stability, while the vertical and horizontal parts of the "T" are added subsequently. The `ab_drop()` function is used to position and drop the blocks in a stable manner.
