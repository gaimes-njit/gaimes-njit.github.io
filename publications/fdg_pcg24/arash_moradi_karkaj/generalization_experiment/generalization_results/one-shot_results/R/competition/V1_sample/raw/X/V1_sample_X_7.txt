To generate a stable structure that looks like the "X" shape, we can use the following sequence of 'ab drop()' function calls:

1. Drop a b13 block at layer 15 with its center at slot 10.
2. Drop a b13 block at layer 14 with its center at slot 11.
3. Drop a b13 block at layer 13 with its center at slot 12.
4. Drop a b31 block at layer 12 with its center at slot 10.
5. Drop a b31 block at layer 11 with its center at slot 13.
6. Drop a b11 block at layer 10 with its center at slot 11.

By following these steps and adjusting the slot positions as needed, we can create a stable structure that resembles the "X" shape using the 'ab drop()' function in the given environment.
