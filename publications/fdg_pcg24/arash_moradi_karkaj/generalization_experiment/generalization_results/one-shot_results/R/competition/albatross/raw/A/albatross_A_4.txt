To construct a level for Science Birds that resembles the English letter "A," we can use the ab_drop() function with the following sequence of calls:

ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b13', 13)

This sequence of calls will drop the blocks in a way that forms the letter "A" with a stable structure.
