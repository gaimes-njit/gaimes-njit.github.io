Example:

```python
ab_drop(b31, 7)
ab_drop(b13, 7)
ab_drop(b11, 8)
ab_drop(b13, 13)
ab_drop(b31, 14)
ab_drop(b13, 14)
ab_drop(b11, 15)
```

Explanation:

In this example, we use the `ab_drop()` function to create a stable structure representing the capital letter "B". We strategically place blocks in the following order:

1. Drop the block `b31` at `x_position` 7 to form the top horizontal segment of the letter "B".
2. Drop the block `b13` at `x_position` 7 to form the left vertical segment of the letter "B".
3. Drop the block `b11` at `x_position` 8 to form the middle segment of the letter "B".
4. Drop the block `b13` at `x_position` 13 to form the right vertical segment of the letter "B".
5. Drop the block `b31` at `x_position` 14 to form the bottom horizontal segment of the letter "B".
6. Drop the block `b13` at `x_position` 14 to complete the right vertical segment of the letter "B".
7. Drop the block `b11` at `x_position` 15 to complete the middle segment of the letter "B".

The resulting structure forms a stable and aesthetically pleasing representation of the capital letter "B".
