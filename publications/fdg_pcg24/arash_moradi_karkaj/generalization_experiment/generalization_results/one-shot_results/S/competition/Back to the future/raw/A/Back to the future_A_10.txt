To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` variable provided:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Since the uppercase character "A" is composed of three block types (b11, b31, b13), we'll need to strategically place these blocks to form the shape of the letter.

3. To ensure stability, we will drop each block from the top using the `ab_drop()` function and check for stability after each drop.

4. Start by dropping the b13 block in the middle slot of the bottom layer (layer 0). This will be the base of the "A" structure. Call `ab_drop('b13', 9)` to drop the b13 block in the middle slot (slot 9).

5. Next, drop a b31 block centered above the base block. Call `ab_drop('b31', 9)` to drop the b31 block above the b13 block.

6. Finally, drop another b13 block centered above the previous two blocks. Call `ab_drop('b13', 9)` to drop the final b13 block above the b31 block.

7. After each block drop, check for stability using the stability checks mentioned in the constraints. Ensure that the block doesn't collapse or descend after being dropped.

8. Repeat steps 4-7 with different slots if the structure doesn't meet the stability conditions.

9. The final structure should resemble the uppercase character "A" and meet all the hard constraints mentioned.

Here's an example of code that follows the steps mentioned above:

```
# Step 1: Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Drop the b13 block at the base
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Step 3: Drop the b31 block above the base
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Step 4: Drop the final b13 block above the b31 block
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

You can adjust the slot numbers and block types according to the constraints and requirements to generate different structures.
