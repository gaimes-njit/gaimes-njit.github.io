To use the `ab_drop()` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "B", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start building the base of the structure by dropping a b31 block centered at slot 9:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Drop two b31 blocks centered at slots 4 and 14 respectively on layer 1 to provide stable support for the base:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

4. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 4 on layer 2 to create the top-left part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

5. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 14 on layer 2 to create the top-right part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

6. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 9 on layer 3 to connect the two vertical parts of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

7. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 9 on layer 4 to create the center part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

8. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 9 on layer 5 to continue building the center part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

9. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 9 on layer 6 to complete the center part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

10. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 9 on layer 7 to create the bottom-left part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

11. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 9 on layer 8 to create the bottom-right part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

12. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 4 on layer 9 to provide support for the bottom-left part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

13. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 14 on layer 9 to provide support for the bottom-right part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

14. Drop two b31 blocks centered at slots 4 and 14 respectively on layer 10 to create the bottom part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

15. Drop two b31 blocks centered at slots 4 and 14 respectively on layer 11 to continue building the bottom part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

16. Drop two b31 blocks centered at slots 4 and 14 respectively on layer 12 to complete the bottom part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

17. Drop a b11 block centered at slot 9 on layer 13 to create the connecting part between the bottom-left and bottom-right parts of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

18. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 4 on layer 14 to provide support for the connecting part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

19. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 14 on layer 14 to provide support for the connecting part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

20. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 4 on layer 15 to complete the top-left part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

21. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 14 on layer 15 to complete the top-right part of the character "B":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```

After following these steps, the `structure` grid will contain a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "B".
