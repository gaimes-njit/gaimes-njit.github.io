To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "B," we can start by analyzing the desired shape and breaking it down into smaller components.

The uppercase "B" consists of two vertical blocks (b13) and one horizontal block (b31), arranged in such a way that the horizontal block is sandwiched between the two vertical blocks.

To meet the stability constraint, we need to ensure that the blocks are placed in a way that they provide support to each other. This means that the vertical blocks need to be dropped first, followed by the horizontal block.

Now, let's consider the steps to generate the structure:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first vertical block (b13) at a suitable position towards the left side of the map. Make sure that the block's center aligns with a slot (y) for stability. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block and update the structure accordingly. Record the coordinates of the block drop.
```python
ab_drop('b13', y)
```

3. Drop the second vertical block (b13) on the right side of the map, aligning its center with a different slot (y) for stability. Again, use the `ab_drop()` function and update the structure. Record the coordinates of the block drop.
```python
ab_drop('b13', y)
```

4. Drop the horizontal block (b31) in the middle of the two vertical blocks, aligning its center with another slot (y) for stability. Use the `ab_drop()` function and update the structure. Record the coordinates of the block drop.
```python
ab_drop('b31', y)
```

5. At this point, the structure should resemble the uppercase letter "B". You can check if the structure meets the stability constraints by examining the rows where the blocks were dropped. Ensure that there is proper support for each block and that the structure does not collapse.

6. If the stability constraints are satisfied, you can continue adding more details or variations to the structure to make it more diverse while still resembling the letter "B". Consider adding extra blocks or modifying the position of existing blocks within the constraints of stability.

It is important to continually check the stability of the structure after each block drop to ensure a stable and robust final design.

Remember to always record the coordinates of the block drops to meet the constraint of listing them.

By following these steps and making use of the `ab_drop()` function, you can generate a stable structure resembling the uppercase letter "B" that satisfies the given constraints.
