To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "C" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully plan the order and position of each block drop. Here is how we can approach the problem:

1. Starting from the base layer (layer 0), we will drop a b31 block at the center slot (slot 10) using the `ab_drop('b31', 10)` function. This will serve as the horizontal bottom part of the "C".

2. Next, we will drop a b13 block above the middle slot of the previous b31 block (slot 10) to connect the bottom and top parts of the "C". Use the `ab_drop('b13', 10)` function for this.

3. Now, we will create the top part of the "C" by dropping a b31 block on top of the previously dropped b13 block. The center of this block should align with the slot where the b31 block was dropped in the first step. Use the `ab_drop('b31', 10)` function again.

4. To complete the "C" shape, we need to drop a b31 block at the left end of the structure. We can do this by dropping the block at slot 0 using the `ab_drop('b31', 0)` function. Make sure to perform stability checks before each drop.

Here is the step-by-step solution using the `ab_drop()` function:

```
# initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# drop the first b31 block at the center slot of the base layer
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# drop the b13 block above the middle slot of the previous b31 block
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# drop the second b31 block at the same slot as the first b31 block
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# drop the third b31 block at the left end of the structure
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# print the structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This solution will generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "C". Due to the randomness involved in the block-stacking problem and the constraints provided, the exact structure generated may vary between runs, but it will always resemble the letter "C".
