To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "C" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided `structure` variable.

2. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and at slot 7. This will be the base of the structure.

3. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 1 and at slot 7. This will provide support for the upper part of the structure.

4. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b13 block at layer 1 and at slot 11.

5. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b13 block at layer 2 and at slot 11.

6. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b13 block at layer 3 and at slot 11.

7. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 3 and at slot 7. This will provide support for the upper part of the structure.

8. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 4 and at slot 7.

9. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 5 and at slot 7.

10. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 6 and at slot 7.

11. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 7 and at slot 7.

12. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 8 and at slot 7.

13. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 9 and at slot 7.

14. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 10 and at slot 7.

15. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 11 and at slot 7.

16. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 12 and at slot 7.

17. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 13 and at slot 7.

18. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 14 and at slot 7.

19. Call the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block at layer 15 and at slot 7.

20. The resulting structure will resemble the uppercase character "C" and satisfy the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here's the code implementation for generating the "C" structure:

```
# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Function to drop a block and update the structure
def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Drop the blocks to form the "C" structure
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 7)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This will generate a stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "C" and meets all the hard constraints.
