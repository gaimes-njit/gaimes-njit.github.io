To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "E" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, we need to plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks carefully. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Drop the vertical block `b13` in the center of the map, aligned with slot 9. This will form the middle line of the "E".
   - `ab_drop('b13', 9)`
   - Update the structure: `structure[15][9] = 'b13'`

2. Drop the horizontal block `b31` above the vertical block at slot 9, aligned with slots 8, 9, and 10. This will form the top line of the "E".
   - `ab_drop('b31', 8)`
   - Update the structure: `structure[14][8] = 'b31'`
   - `ab_drop('b31', 9)`
   - Update the structure: `structure[14][9] = 'b31'`
   - `ab_drop('b31', 10)`
   - Update the structure: `structure[14][10] = 'b31'`

3. Drop the horizontal block `b31` below the vertical block at slot 9, aligned with slots 8, 9, and 10. This will form the bottom line of the "E".
   - `ab_drop('b31', 8)`
   - Update the structure: `structure[13][8] = 'b31'`
   - `ab_drop('b31', 9)`
   - Update the structure: `structure[13][9] = 'b31'`
   - `ab_drop('b31', 10)`
   - Update the structure: `structure[13][10] = 'b31'`

4. Drop the square block `b11` above the vertical block at slot 9, aligned with slot 9. This will connect the top line and the middle line of the "E".
   - `ab_drop('b11', 9)`
   - Update the structure: `structure[14][9] = 'b11'`

5. Drop the square block `b11` below the vertical block at slot 9, aligned with slot 9. This will connect the middle line and the bottom line of the "E".
   - `ab_drop('b11', 9)`
   - Update the structure: `structure[13][9] = 'b11'`

After following these steps, you should have a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "E" and meets all the hard constraints. Remember to check stability before each call to `ab_drop()` and update the structure accordingly.

Please note that this approach assumes a specific layout of the block types to form the shape of the "E". You can adjust the dropping positions and order according to your preferences as long as the resulting structure remains stable and resembles the desired shape.
