To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "F" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in the following way:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the first block 'b31' in the center of the bottom layer:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This ensures stability as the block is supported by the base.

3. Place the second block 'b31' above the first block, slightly shifted to the right:
```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```
This creates the vertical stem of the "F" character.

4. Place the third block 'b13' above the previously dropped blocks, centered between them:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
This completes the horizontal crossbar of the "F" character.

5. Place the fourth block 'b11' above the vertical stem, centered between the horizontal crossbar and the top edge of the structure:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
This adds a small dot to the top of the vertical stem, completing the structure that resembles the uppercase letter "F".

By following these steps, we ensure that the structure meets the stability constraint and resembles the desired letter shape. We can repeat this process to generate additional variations of the "F" character by changing the position and order of the block drops.
