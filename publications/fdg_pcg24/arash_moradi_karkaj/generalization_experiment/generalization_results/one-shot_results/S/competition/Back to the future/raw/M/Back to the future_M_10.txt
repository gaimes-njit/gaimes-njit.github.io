Solution:

To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "M" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the approach outlined below:

1. First, we need to define the specific structure of the character "M" using the block types b11, b13, and b31. Let's define the structure as follows:
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
structure[14][4] = 'b13'
structure[14][5] = 'b31'
structure[14][6] = 'b13'
structure[13][5] = 'b11'
structure[12][4] = 'b11'
structure[12][6] = 'b11'

2. Next, we need to ensure stability by checking the stability of each layer before dropping a block. We can achieve this by modifying the ab_drop() function as follows:
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type, y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break

    # check stability by ensuring that the blocks below can support the dropped block
    if x == 'b11':
        if drop_pos[0] < H-1 and structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            return False
    elif x == 'b13':
        if drop_pos[0] < H-2 and (structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ' or structure[drop_pos[0]+2][drop_pos[1]] != ' '):
            return False
    elif x == 'b31':
        if drop_pos[0] < H-1 and (structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]-1] != ' ' or structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]+1] != ' '):
            return False
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    
    return True

3. Using the modified ab_drop() function, we can drop the blocks one by one to construct the entire structure. The correct order and position of the drops are crucial to ensure stability. We can use techniques from the block-stacking problem to determine the drop position and order.

Here is an example of how the ab_drop() function can be called to generate the "M" structure:

ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Drop the first b13 block at slot 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Drop the b31 block at slot 5 to connect the two b13 blocks
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Drop the second b13 block at slot 6

ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Drop the b11 block to create the middle part of the "M"
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Drop the b11 block to create the left part of the "M"
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Drop the b11 block to create the right part of the "M"

Note: The above calls to ab_drop() are just an example. The actual order and positions may vary, but they should result in a stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "M".

By generating the structure in this manner, we ensure stability, satisfy the hard constraints, and create a diverse structure that resembles the uppercase character "M".
