To use the `ab_drop()` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase letter "O", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b31 block at the center of the bottom layer to create a stable base. The center slot can be calculated as `(W // 2) - 1`. Call `ab_drop('b31', (W // 2) - 1)` to drop the block and update the structure.

3. To create the sides of the "O", we need to drop b13 blocks vertically aligned with the sides of the base. Call `ab_drop('b13', 0)` to drop the left side block, and `ab_drop('b13', W - 1)` to drop the right side block.

4. To complete the top part of the "O", we need to drop a b31 block on top of the left and right side blocks. Call `ab_drop('b31', 1)` to drop the block above the left side, and `ab_drop('b31', W - 2)` to drop the block above the right side.

5. After completing the steps above, the structure should resemble the uppercase letter "O". You can print the structure to see the final result.

Here is the complete code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type, y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop b31 block to create a stable base
ab_drop('b31', (W // 2) - 1)

# Drop b13 blocks on the sides of the base
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Left side
ab_drop('b13', W - 1)  # Right side

# Drop b31 blocks on top of the sides
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Above the left side
ab_drop('b31', W - 2)  # Above the right side

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the uppercase letter "O" by using the `ab_drop()` function according to the given constraints.
