To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "V" and meets all the hard constraints, the following steps can be followed:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at the center of the lower layer (layer 0) to act as the base support:
```
ab_drop('b13', W//2)  # Drop b13 at the center slot
```
This ensures stability and provides a base support for the rest of the structure.

3. Drop a b31 block on top of the base support, centered at the same slot, to form the center of the "V" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', W//2)  # Drop b31 on top of the base support
```
This satisfies constraint 5.4 as the b31 structure is stable and supported by the b13 block.

4. Drop a b11 block on top of the b31 block, centered at the same slot, to form the top of the "V" shape:
```
ab_drop('b11', W//2)  # Drop b11 on top of the b31
```
This completes the generation of the stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "V".

5. Repeat steps 2-4 multiple times, varying the slot position, to generate diverse structures that meet the given constraints and resemble different uppercase letters.

Example structure generation for additional letters:

- Generating letter 'T':
```
# First vertical stroke of 'T'
ab_drop('b13', W//2)  # Drop b13 at the center slot

# Horizontal stroke of 'T'
ab_drop('b31', W//2-1)  # Drop b31 to the left of the center
ab_drop('b31', W//2)    # Drop b31 at the center

# Top of 'T'
ab_drop('b11', W//2)    # Drop b11 on top of the b31
```

- Generating letter 'U':
```
# Left vertical stroke of 'U'
ab_drop('b13', W//3)    # Drop b13 to the left third of the slots

# Right vertical stroke of 'U'
ab_drop('b13', W-(W//3)-1)  # Drop b13 to the right third of the slots

# Bottom of 'U'
ab_drop('b31', W//2-1)  # Drop b31 to the left of the center
ab_drop('b31', W//2)    # Drop b31 at the center

# Top of 'U'
ab_drop('b11', W//2)    # Drop b11 on top of the b31
```

These are just examples to illustrate the process of generating different letters. The exact positions and order of block drops can be adjusted to generate various uppercase letters while ensuring stability and meeting all the given constraints.
