# Solution:

To generate a stable structure resembling the letter "C", we can use the following series of `ab_drop()` function calls:

```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Explanation:

1. `ab_drop('b31', 8)`: Dropping a 'b31' block with the center pivot at slot 8 ensures stability because it is supported by the bottom layer. This forms the top of the "C" shape.

2. `ab_drop('b13', 7)`: Dropping a 'b13' block at slot 7 creates the middle section of the "C" shape. By placing it one slot to the left of the previous block, we achieve stability because the load is distributed evenly.

3. `ab_drop('b13', 6)`: Dropping another 'b13' block at slot 6 extends the middle section further to the left. Again, by placing it one slot to the left of the previous block, we ensure stability.

4. `ab_drop('b13', 5)`: Finally, dropping a 'b13' block at slot 5 completes the bottom section of the "C" shape. Placing it one slot to the left of the previous block ensures stability.

This series of `ab_drop()` function calls creates a stable structure resembling the capital English letter "C".
