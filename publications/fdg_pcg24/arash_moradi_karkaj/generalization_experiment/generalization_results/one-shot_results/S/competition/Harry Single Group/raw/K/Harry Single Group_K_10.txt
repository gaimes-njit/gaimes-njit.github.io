To form a shape resembling the letter "K" using the available bricks and the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the field by creating a 2D list with dimensions 16x20, representing the 320 cells of the field. Each cell can be represented by the value 0 to indicate that it is unoccupied.

2. Start by placing the b31 brick vertically on the ground, with the x_position at the center of the field (x_position = 9). Use the ab_drop() function to place the brick: ab_drop('b31', 9). This will occupy the cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).

3. Place the b13 brick horizontally above the bottom-right cell of the b31 brick, with the x_position at the center of the b13 brick (x_position = 10). Use the ab_drop() function to place the brick: ab_drop('b13', 10). This will occupy the cells (10, 0), (10, 1), and (10, 2).

4. Place the b31 brick vertically above the bottom-right cell of the b13 brick, with the x_position at the center of the field (x_position = 9). Use the ab_drop() function to place the brick: ab_drop('b31', 9). This will occupy the cells (8, 3), (9, 3), and (10, 3).

5. The shape resembling the letter "K" is now formed on the field.

The code to generate the required structure is as follows:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the field
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Step 2: Place the b31 brick vertically on the ground
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Step 3: Place the b13 brick horizontally above the bottom-right cell of the b31 brick
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Step 4: Place the b31 brick vertically above the bottom-right cell of the b13 brick
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Please note that the code to initialize the field and call the ab_drop() function should be implemented separately from the analysis and explanations.
