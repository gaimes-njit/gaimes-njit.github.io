To generate the required structure resembling the letter "L" using the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty field with a width of 20 and a height of 16.
2. Use the ab_drop('b31', x) function to place the horizontal rectangle brick at a suitable x position on the ground. We need to ensure that the occupied cells of the brick do not exceed the boundaries of the field.
3. Use the ab_drop('b13', x) function to place the vertical rectangle brick just above the previously placed brick. Again, make sure to check for boundary collisions.
4. Check the stability of the two bricks by comparing the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot point. If the structure is unstable, adjust the x position of the bricks until stability is achieved.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 to continue building the remaining part of the "L" shape using the ab_drop() function.
6. The final structure should resemble the letter "L" and satisfy the stability and boundary collision requirements.

Here is an example code that generates the required structure:

```python
# Initialize an empty field
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check stability
def is_stable(brick):
    left_count = 0
    right_count = 0
    pivot = brick[0]
    for cell in brick:
        if cell[0] < pivot[0]:
            left_count += 1
        elif cell[0] > pivot[0]:
            right_count += 1
    return left_count == right_count

# Function to check boundary collision
def is_within_bounds(brick):
    for cell in brick:
        if cell[0] < 0 or cell[0] >= 20 or cell[1] < 0 or cell[1] >= 16:
            return False
    return True

# Function to place a brick on the field
def place_brick(brick):
    for cell in brick:
        field[cell[1]][cell[0]] = 1

# Function to drop a brick and check stability, boundary collision
def ab_drop(brick_type, x_position):
    if brick_type == 'b31':
        brick = [(x_position-1, 0), (x_position, 0), (x_position+1, 0)]
    elif brick_type == 'b13':
        brick = [(x_position, 2), (x_position, 1), (x_position, 0)]
    elif brick_type == 'b11':
        brick = [(x_position, 0)]
    
    while is_within_bounds(brick):
        if is_stable(brick):
            place_brick(brick)
            return
        else:
            for i in range(len(brick)):
                brick[i] = (brick[i][0], brick[i][1]-1)
    
    # Brick cannot be dropped, handle collision or out of bounds scenario here
    
# Generate the required structure resembling the letter "L"
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the first brick horizontally at x position 5
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Place the second brick vertically above the first brick at x position 5
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Place the third brick horizontally next to the second brick at x position 6
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place the fourth brick as a square above the third brick at x position 6
```
