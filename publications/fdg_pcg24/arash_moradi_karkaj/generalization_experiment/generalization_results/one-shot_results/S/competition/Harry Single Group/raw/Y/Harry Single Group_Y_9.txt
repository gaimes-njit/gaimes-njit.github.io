First, let's initialize the field by creating an empty 2D array with dimensions 16x20. We can represent the empty cell with a 0.

```python
# Field Initialization
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, we can start generating the structure resembling the letter "Y" using the ab_drop() function. We need to make sure to satisfy the important notes mentioned.

```python
# Generate the structure resembling the letter "Y"
# Building the left vertical part of the "Y"
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Generate the bottom single brick at x_position 8
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Generate the center single brick at x_position 9
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Generate the top single brick at x_position 10

# Building the right vertical part of the "Y"
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Generate the bottom vertical brick at x_position 10
ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Generate the middle vertical brick at x_position 11
ab_drop('b13', 12)  # Generate the top vertical brick at x_position 12

# Building the horizontal part of the "Y"
ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Generate the bottom horizontal brick at x_position 8
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Generate the middle horizontal brick at x_position 9
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Generate the top horizontal brick at x_position 10
```

To ensure stability and avoid boundary collisions, we need to check the occupancy of cells before dropping each brick. If a previously placed brick is occupying the current position, we can stop the descent of the current brick.

```python
# Generate the structure resembling the letter "Y"
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Generate the bottom single brick at x_position 8
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Generate the center single brick at x_position 9
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Generate the top single brick at x_position 10

ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Generate the bottom vertical brick at x_position 10
ab_drop('b13', 11)  # Generate the middle vertical brick at x_position 11
ab_drop('b13', 12)  # Generate the top vertical brick at x_position 12

ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Generate the bottom horizontal brick at x_position 8
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Generate the middle horizontal brick at x_position 9
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Generate the top horizontal brick at x_position 10
```

By executing the above code, the cells occupied by the structure resembling the letter "Y" will be marked as 1 in the field array.
