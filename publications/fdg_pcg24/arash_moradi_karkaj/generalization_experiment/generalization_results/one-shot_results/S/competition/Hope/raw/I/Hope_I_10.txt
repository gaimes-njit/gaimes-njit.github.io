To create the structure of the letter "I" inside the 20*16 box area, you can use the ab_drop('blocktype', x position) command for each block required.

Here is the sequence of commands to create the "I" structure:

1. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 0): ab_drop('b13', 9)
2. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 2): ab_drop('b13', 9)
3. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 4): ab_drop('b13', 9)
4. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 6): ab_drop('b13', 9)
5. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 8): ab_drop('b13', 9)
6. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 10): ab_drop('b13', 9)
7. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 12): ab_drop('b13', 9)
8. Drop a b13 block at position (9, 14): ab_drop('b13', 9)

This sequence of commands will create the letter "I" inside the 20*16 box area.
