To create the structure "M" inside a 20*16 box using the provided block types, we can use the following commands:

ab_drop('b31', 0)   # Creates the left vertical line of the "M"
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Creates the slanted line of the "M"
ab_drop('b11', 5)   # Creates the middle point of the "M"
ab_drop('b13', 9)   # Creates the slanted line of the "M"
ab_drop('b31', 12)  # Creates the right vertical line of the "M"

Note that the x position values used in the ab_drop commands determine the starting position of each block. You can adjust these values based on the desired spacing and positioning within the box.
