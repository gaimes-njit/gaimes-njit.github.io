To create the structure exactly like "O" inside a 20*16 box, we can use the following ab_drop commands:

ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 16)
ab_drop('b31', 16)

This sequence of commands will drop the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter "O" inside the 20*16 box. The blocks used are b31 (3*1 block) and b13 (1*3 block).
