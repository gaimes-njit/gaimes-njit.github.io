To create the structure of "Q" inside a 20*16 box block using the ab_drop() command, you can follow these steps:

1. Place the initial vertical line of the "Q" using the b31 block.
   - Command: ab_drop('b31', 0)

2. Place the horizontal line of the "Q" using the b13 block.
   - Command: ab_drop('b13', 3)

3. Add the bottom vertical line of the "Q" using the b31 block.
   - Command: ab_drop('b31', 6)

This will create the shape of "Q" within the 20*16 box, where the area starts counting from 0,0.
