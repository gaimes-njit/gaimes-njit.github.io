This command will place a horizontal straight block of width 3 units at position 5 on the grid.

``` python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

Similarly, to generate the letter D, we can use a combination of block types. Here is the sequence of commands to generate the letter D:

``` python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 14)
ab_drop('b13', 17)
ab_drop('b13', 20)
```

This sequence of commands will place blocks in the shape of the letter D on the grid while obeying the gravity rules.
