ab_drop('b13',1)

Step 2: Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1,2) to extend the top line of the "F" to the right. 
ab_drop('b31',2)

Step 3: Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at position (1,4) to form the right vertical line of the "F".
ab_drop('b13',4)

Step 4: Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position (2,2) to extend the middle line of the "F" to the right. 
ab_drop('b31',2)

Step 5: Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at position (3,2) to extend the bottom line of the "F" to the right.
