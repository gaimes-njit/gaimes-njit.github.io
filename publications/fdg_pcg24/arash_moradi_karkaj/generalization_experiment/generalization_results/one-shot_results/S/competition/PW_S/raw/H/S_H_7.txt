The prompt requires us to generate the uppercase English letter "H" using the mentioned command and block types in the defined environment.

To construct the letter "H", we can break it down into three block types: two vertical straight blocks (b13) and one horizontal straight block (b31).

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "H":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   // place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)   // place the first vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 4)   // place the second vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 5)   // place the second horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 7)   // place the third vertical straight block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 9)   // place the fourth vertical straight block at position 9
ab_drop('b31', 10)  // place the third horizontal straight block at position 10
```

By following these commands in the given environment, we can construct the uppercase English letter "H".
