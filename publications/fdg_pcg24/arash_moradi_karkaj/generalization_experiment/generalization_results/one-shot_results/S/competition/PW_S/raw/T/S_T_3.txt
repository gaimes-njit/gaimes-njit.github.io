There are multiple ways to generate the uppercase letter "T" using the given block types. Here is one possible solution:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This solution starts by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2. Then, a horizontal straight block (b31) is placed at position 1, followed by three 1x1 square blocks (b11) placed in a row at positions 2, 1, and 3. Finally, the T shape is completed by placing another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2.
