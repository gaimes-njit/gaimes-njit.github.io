The example provided is not enough to generate the letter "U". Here is a sequence of ab_drop() commands that can be used to create the letter "U" in the defined environment:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',7)
ab_drop('b31',7)
ab_drop('b13',1)
```

This sequence of commands starts by placing a horizontal block type b31 at position 1 to create the top of the letter "U". Then, a vertical block type b13 is placed at position 4 to create the left side of the letter "U". Next, two horizontal block type b31s are placed at position 7 to create the bottom of the letter "U". Finally, another vertical block type b13 is placed at position 1 to complete the right side of the letter "U".
