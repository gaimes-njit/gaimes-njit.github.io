Here is a possible solution to generate the letter "U":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

Explanation:

1. Place a horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block of height 3 at position 1, below the previous block.
3. Place another vertical straight block of height 3 at position 4, to the right of the previous block.
4. Finally, place another horizontal straight block of width 3 at position 4, below the previous block.

The resulting configuration will resemble the letter "U".
