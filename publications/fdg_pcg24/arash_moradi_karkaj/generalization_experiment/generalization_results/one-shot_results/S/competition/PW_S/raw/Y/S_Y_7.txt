Task:
Your task is to generate the uppercase English letter "Y" using the given command and block types in the defined environment. You should construct the letter by dropping each block one by one, ensuring stability with respect to the gravity rules.

Instructions:
To generate the letter "Y", you can use the following stream of commands as an example:

```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "Y" in the grid environment. Each `ab_drop()` command should be consecutively included between three backticks (```). The first parameter in the `ab_drop()` command represents the block type ('b31', 'b13', or 'b11'), and the second parameter indicates the position along the width.

Please make sure to follow the given rules and constraints while constructing the letter "Y".
