To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks carefully. Following are the steps to achieve this:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base of the character "K" using two b11 blocks at slots 8 and 11 to form the bottom horizontal line.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

Step 3: Place the vertical line of the character "K" using a b13 block at slot 15 on top of the base.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 15)
```

Step 4: Place the top horizontal line of the character "K" using two b11 blocks at slots 8 and 11, one layer above the vertical line.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

The resulting structure should resemble the character "K" and meet all the hard constraints. Keep in mind that the dropping positions and order are crucial to ensure stability and no boundary intrusion.
