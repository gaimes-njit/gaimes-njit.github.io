To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided map initialization code. 

2. Start building the structure by first dropping a b13 block at slot 0. Use the ab_drop() function with arguments (b13, 0) to place the block vertically at the leftmost slot.

3. Next, drop a b31 block at slot 1. Use the ab_drop() function with arguments (b31, 1) to place the block horizontally on top of the previously placed b13 block.

4. Drop another b13 block at slot 4. Use the ab_drop() function with arguments (b13, 4) to place the block vertically on top of the b31 block.

5. Now, drop a b31 block at slot 5. Use the ab_drop() function with arguments (b31, 5) to place the block horizontally on top of the previously placed b13 block.

6. Finally, drop a b13 block at slot 8. Use the ab_drop() function with arguments (b13, 8) to place the block vertically on top of the b31 block.

After following these steps, the structure will resemble the character "N" and will meet all the hard constraints regarding stability and boundary intrusion.
