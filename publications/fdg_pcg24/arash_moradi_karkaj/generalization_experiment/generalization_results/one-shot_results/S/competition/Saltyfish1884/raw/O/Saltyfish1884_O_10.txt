To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "O" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the following step-by-step approach:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given Python code:

```python
W = 20  # Map width
H = 16  # Map height

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base block (b13) on the bottom layer (layer 0) to provide a solid foundation:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop b13 at slot 9
```

Step 3: Place the bottom row of blocks (b11) on top of the base block to prevent overhangs:

```python
for i in range(8, 12):
    ab_drop('b11', i)  # Drop b11 at slots 8, 9, 10, 11
```

Step 4: Place the second row of blocks (b11) above the bottom row:

```python
for i in range(8, 12):
    ab_drop('b11', i)  # Drop b11 at slots 8, 9, 10, 11
```

Step 5: Place the third row of blocks (b11) above the second row:

```python
for i in range(8, 12):
    ab_drop('b11', i)  # Drop b11 at slots 8, 9, 10, 11
```

Step 6: Place the top row of blocks (b11) above the third row:

```python
for i in range(8, 12):
    ab_drop('b11', i)  # Drop b11 at slots 8, 9, 10, 11
```

Step 7: Output the final structure:

```python
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "O" and meet all the given requirements. Note that you may need to adjust the slot numbers and block types based on the desired positioning of the blocks.
