To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "W" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully place the blocks using the ab_drop() function. Let's break down the steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Determine the dropping position and order for each block. Since stability is a primary constraint, we need to consider the stability rules mentioned in constraint 5.1. We'll start by dropping the b13 block to create a stable base.

Step 3: Drop the b13 block using the ab_drop() function at slot 9. This will create a stable base for the structure.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Step 4: Drop the b31 block on top of the b13 block to create the middle part of the "W". We'll drop it at slot 8 to align with the bottom center of the b13 block.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

Step 5: Drop the next b31 block on top of the previous one to complete the middle part of the "W". We'll drop it at slot 10 to align with the bottom center of the b13 block.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

Step 6: Drop the b13 block on top of the middle part of the "W" to create the top part. We'll drop it at slot 9 to align with the bottom center of the b13 block.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Step 7: The structure is now complete and resembles the character "W"! You can print the structure to see the final result.
```python
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The code snippet above only provides an example. To generate a new structure that meets all the requirements, you can modify the dropping positions and order of the blocks based on the stability rules and the desired shape.
