To build the capital letter "A" in the grid, we can break it down into two parts: the diagonal strokes and the crossbar.

First, let's build the two diagonal strokes of the "A":

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)  # Place a row block at x_position=7 for the top diagonal stroke
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place a row block at x_position=9 for the bottom diagonal stroke
```

Now, let's build the crossbar of the "A":

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Place a row block at x_position=2 for the left side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b31", 14)  # Place a row block at x_position=14 for the right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Place a column block at x_position=2 to connect the left side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 3)  # Place a column block at x_position=3 to connect the left side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 13)  # Place a column block at x_position=13 to connect the right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 14)  # Place a column block at x_position=14 to connect the right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Place a column block at x_position=4 to connect the left and right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Place a column block at x_position=5 to connect the left and right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 11)  # Place a column block at x_position=11 to connect the left and right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 12)  # Place a column block at x_position=12 to connect the left and right side of the crossbar
```

The complete implementation to build the capital letter "A" would be:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)  # Place a row block at x_position=7 for the top diagonal stroke
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place a row block at x_position=9 for the bottom diagonal stroke
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Place a row block at x_position=2 for the left side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b31", 14)  # Place a row block at x_position=14 for the right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Place a column block at x_position=2 to connect the left side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 3)  # Place a column block at x_position=3 to connect the left side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 13)  # Place a column block at x_position=13 to connect the right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 14)  # Place a column block at x_position=14 to connect the right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Place a column block at x_position=4 to connect the left and right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Place a column block at x_position=5 to connect the left and right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 11)  # Place a column block at x_position=11 to connect the left and right side of the crossbar
ab_drop("b13", 12)  # Place a column block at x_position=12 to connect the left and right side of the crossbar
```
