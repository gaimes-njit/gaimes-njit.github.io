To create the letter "C" using the ab_drop() function, we can start by placing a row block (b31) at the bottom left of the grid. This will serve as the base of the letter "C".

Next, we can place a column block (b13) on top of the row block, centered horizontally. This will form the curve of the letter "C".

Finally, we can place another row block (b31) on top of the column block, positioned to the right. This will complete the letter "C".

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
