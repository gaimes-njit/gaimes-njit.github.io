To generate a structure that looks like the letter "E" in the level, we can follow the hints provided. We will start by dropping the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability and similarity.

First, we will place the base blocks of the letter "E", which are two "b31" blocks stacked on top of each other. We will center each block at x_position = 8 to create stability. This will form the bottom bar of the "E".

Then, we will place the top bar of the "E" using a "b13" block. We will center it at x_position = 8 to align with the bottom bar. This block will complete the shape of the letter "E".

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Place the bottom bar of the "E"
ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Place the second block of the bottom bar of the "E"
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Place the top bar of the "E"

By following this implementation, the structure will resemble the letter "E" and will be stable.
