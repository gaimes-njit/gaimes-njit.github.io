To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "N", we can break it down into three parts: two vertical bars and one horizontal bar connecting them.

Here's the step-by-step implementation to achieve the desired structure while ensuring stability:

1. Drop the first vertical bar on the left side:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

2. Drop the horizontal bar connecting the vertical bars:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

3. Drop the second vertical bar on the right side:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 17)
```

The complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 17)
```
