To generate the structure of the letter "V", we can use the following steps:

Step 1: Place two row blocks (b31) at the bottom to form the base of the "V".
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 13)

Step 2: Place two column blocks (b13) on top of the row blocks to form the sides of the "V".
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 16)

Step 3: Place a square block (b11) in the center to complete the "V".
ab_drop("b11", 10)

The complete implementation code is as follows:

ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 16)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
