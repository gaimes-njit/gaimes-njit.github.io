To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "E", we can use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop blocks and satisfy the given constraints. Here is an algorithm that can be used:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code.

2. Start by dropping the vertical block b13 at slot 0 using `ab_drop('b13', 0)` to form the left vertical stroke of the "E". This block will land on layer 1, as it is the layer on top of the base.

3. Drop the square block b11 at slot 1 using `ab_drop('b11', 1)`. This block will also land on layer 1 and will be placed to the right of the vertical block.

4. Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 1 using `ab_drop('b31', 1)` to complete the top stroke of the "E". This block will land on layer 2, as it is above the previously dropped blocks.

5. Drop the square block b11 at slot 1 using `ab_drop('b11', 1)` to add stability to the structure. This block will land on layer 3, as it is above the previous blocks.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 two more times to create additional stability and complete the lower strokes of the "E".

7. Drop the vertical block b13 at slot 1 using `ab_drop('b13', 1)` to extend the center stroke of the "E". This block will land on layer 4, as it is above the previous blocks.

8. Repeat steps 4 and 5 two more times to create additional stability and complete the center stroke of the "E".

9. Check if the resulting structure meets the stability and boundary intrusion constraints. If not, adjust the positions of the blocks by choosing different slots to drop them until a stable and non-intrusive structure is achieved.

Note: The provided algorithm assumes that the `ab_drop()` function will handle collisions and properly stack the blocks on top of each other. It also assumes that blocks will not overlap or intersect with each other, as this is not specified in the problem statement.

By following this algorithm, a stable structure that looks like the character "E" can be generated while satisfying the given constraints.
