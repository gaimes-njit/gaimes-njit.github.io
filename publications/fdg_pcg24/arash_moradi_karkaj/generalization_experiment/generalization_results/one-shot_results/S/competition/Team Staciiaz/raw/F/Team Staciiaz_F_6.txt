To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty W x H grid using the provided code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in the desired positions:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop the horizontal block to create the top bar of the "F"
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop the horizontal block again to make it stable

ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop the horizontal block to create the vertical part of the "F"
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop the horizontal block again to make it stable

ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop the vertical block to complete the vertical part of the "F"
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Drop the horizontal block to create the bottom bar of the "F"
ab_drop('b31', 6)  # Drop the horizontal block again to make it stable
```

3. Check if the resulting structure meets the stability constraint. We can do this by simulating the stability of the structure. If each block has at least two supporting blocks beneath it, the structure is stable. Otherwise, it is unstable. Here's an example code to check stability:

```python
def check_stability(structure):
    for y in range(H-1):
        for x in range(W):
            if structure[y][x] != ' ':
                if (structure[y+1][x] == ' ' and structure[y+1][x-1] == ' ' and structure[y+1][x+1] == ' '):
                    return False
    return True

is_stable = check_stability(structure)
print("Is the structure stable?", is_stable)
```

4. If the structure is stable, print the final structure. Otherwise, adjust the drop positions and order until a stable structure is obtained.

Keep in mind that the above code is just an example and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your problem or implementation.
