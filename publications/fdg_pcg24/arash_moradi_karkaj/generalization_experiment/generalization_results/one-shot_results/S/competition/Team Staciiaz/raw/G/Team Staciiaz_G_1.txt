To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "G" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function and carefully position the blocks to satisfy the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints.

Here's one possible approach to generate the structure:

1. Drop a b31 block at slot 9 and layer 1 using `ab_drop('b31', 9)`.

2. Drop a b11 block at slot 8 and layer 2 using `ab_drop('b11', 8)`.

3. Drop a b13 block at slot 7 and layer 3 using `ab_drop('b13', 7)`.

4. Drop another b13 block at slot 9 and layer 3 using `ab_drop('b13', 9)`.

5. Drop a b11 block at slot 10 and layer 2 using `ab_drop('b11', 10)`.

6. Drop a b13 block at slot 11 and layer 1 using `ab_drop('b13', 11)`.

7. Drop a b11 block at slot 12 and layer 0 using `ab_drop('b11', 12)`.

This arrangement will create a stable structure that resembles the character "G" without intruding on the boundary of the map.

Please note that the slot and layer positions described above are just one possible configuration, and you may need to experiment with different positions to find a stable structure that meets the constraints.
