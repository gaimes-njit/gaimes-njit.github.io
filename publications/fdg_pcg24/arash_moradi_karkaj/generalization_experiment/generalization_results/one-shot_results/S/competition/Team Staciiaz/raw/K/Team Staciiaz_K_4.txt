To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "K", we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner, ensuring stability and meeting all the given constraints.

Here is one possible approach to generate the "K" structure:

1. Start by dropping a b13 block at the center slot (position 9) with its bottom aligned with the base layer (layer 0). This will form the left vertical stroke of the "K".

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

2. Next, drop a b31 block centered at slot 7, two layers above the previously dropped block. This will form the diagonal stroke of the "K".

```
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

3. Finally, drop another b31 block centered at slot 11, two layers above the previously dropped block. This will complete the right vertical stroke of the "K".

```
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

By following these steps, you will have generated a stable structure that looks like the character "K" and meets all the given constraints.
