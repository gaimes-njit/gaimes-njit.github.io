To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "P" and meets all the constraints, you can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks strategically and ensure stability while avoiding boundary intrusion. Here is one possible approach:

1. Start by initializing the structure grid using `structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. To create the vertical part of the "P", drop a b13 block vertically from the bottom layer at an appropriate slot. Choose a slot number that ensures stability and avoids boundary intrusion. For example, you can start by dropping the b13 block at slot 2. Use the `ab_drop('b13', 2)` function to drop the block and update the structure grid.

3. To create the horizontal part of the "P", drop a b31 block horizontally on top of the vertical part. Choose a slot number that ensures stability and avoids boundary intrusion. For example, you can drop the b31 block at slot 3, aligning its center with the vertical block. Use the `ab_drop('b31', 3)` function to drop the block and update the structure grid.

4. Finally, drop a b11 block vertically on top of the horizontal part of the "P" at an appropriate slot to complete the structure. Choose a slot number that ensures stability and avoids boundary intrusion. For example, you can drop the b11 block at slot 4, aligning its center with the horizontal block. Use the `ab_drop('b11', 4)` function to drop the block and update the structure grid.

Make sure to consider stability and boundary intrusion at each step to ensure the structure remains stable while meeting the constraints. Adjust the slot numbers as needed to achieve stability and avoid boundary intrusion.
