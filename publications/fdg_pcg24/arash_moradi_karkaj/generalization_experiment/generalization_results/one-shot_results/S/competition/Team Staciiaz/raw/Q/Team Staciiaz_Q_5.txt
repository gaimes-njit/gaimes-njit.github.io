To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Q" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we need to carefully select the dropping positions and order of the blocks.

Here is one possible approach to achieve this:

1. Place the bottom horizontal block `b31` at slots 5-7 to form the base of the "Q". This ensures stability and avoids boundary intrusion.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

The structure now looks like this:

```
      x   x   x      
```

2. Place the two vertical blocks `b13` on top of the base to form the vertical lines of the "Q". The slots for these blocks should be chosen carefully to maintain stability and avoid boundary intrusion.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

The structure now looks like this:

```
   x   x   x   x   x
   x             
   x             
   x   x   x   x   x
```

3. Place the top horizontal block `b31` to complete the loop of the "Q". Again, choose the dropping positions carefully to maintain stability and avoid boundary intrusion.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

The final structure looks like this:

```
   x   x   x   x   x
   x             x
   x             x
   x   x   x   x   x
      x   x   x      
```

This structure resembles the character "Q" and meets all the constraints, including stability and no boundary intrusion.

Note: The specific dropping positions mentioned here are just an example. The exact positions may vary as long as the constraints are satisfied.
