To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "R" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a strategic order.

First, we need to drop the vertical block `b13` at slot 5 to form the right leg of the "R". This will satisfy the stability constraint as the block will be supported by the bottom layer. We can call `ab_drop('b13', 5)` to achieve this.

Next, we can drop the square block `b11` at slot 6 to form the connecting part of the "R". Again, this will satisfy the stability constraint as the block will be supported by the previously dropped vertical block. We can call `ab_drop('b11', 6)` to achieve this.

Finally, we can drop the horizontal block `b31` at slots 6, 7, and 8 to form the top part of the "R". This will satisfy the stability constraint as the block will be supported by the previously dropped blocks. We can call `ab_drop('b31', 6)` for the first block, `ab_drop('b31', 7)` for the second block, and `ab_drop('b31', 8)` for the third block.

After executing these function calls, we will have a stable structure that looks like the character "R" and meets all the constraints.

Here is the code to accomplish this:

```python
# initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # code for ab_drop function mentioned in the question

# drop the vertical block for the right leg of the "R"
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# drop the square block for the connecting part of the "R"
ab_drop('b11', 6)

# drop the horizontal blocks for the top part of the "R"
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

Please note that depending on the specific requirements and constraints, you may need to adjust the slot positions and the block types. The code provided is an example for generating a stable structure that looks like the character "R".
