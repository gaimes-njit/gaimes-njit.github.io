To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "S" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a strategic manner. 

Here's the algorithm:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code.
2. Drop the horizontal blocks (b31) first to form the bottom part of the "S" shape. We can drop two horizontal blocks in slots 2 and 3 to form the base.
3. Drop a vertical block (b13) above the second horizontal block, aligning its center with the center of the bottom horizontal block.
4. Drop another horizontal block, aligning its center with the center of the vertical block.
5. Drop a vertical block above the second horizontal block, aligning its center with the center of the top horizontal block.
6. Finally, drop a horizontal block above the second vertical block, aligning its center with the center of the top horizontal block.

The resulting structure will form a stable "S" shape, satisfying all the constraints.
