To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Y" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the b11 block at the center slot of the bottom layer:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

This will create the center part of the "Y" shape.

3. Drop the b13 block on top of the b11 block at the center slot:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

This will create the vertical part of the "Y" shape.

4. Drop the b31 block on the left side of the bottom layer, aligned with the left slot:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

This will create the left arm of the "Y" shape.

5. Drop the b31 block on the right side of the bottom layer, aligned with the right slot:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 19)
```

This will create the right arm of the "Y" shape.

The resulting structure will be a stable structure that looks like the character "Y" and meets all the constraints.
