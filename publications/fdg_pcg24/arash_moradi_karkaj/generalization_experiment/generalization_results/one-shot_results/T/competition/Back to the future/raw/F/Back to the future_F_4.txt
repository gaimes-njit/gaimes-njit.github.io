To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "F" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b31 block at the center slot y = W//2 on layer 0 to create a stable base:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

3. Drop the b13 blocks on layers 1 to 4 at slot y = W//2 to create the vertical bar of the "F":
```python
for layer in range(1, 5):
    ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

4. Drop the b31 block on layer 2 at slot y = W//2-1 to create the top horizontal bar of the "F":
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2-1)
```

5. Drop the b11 blocks on layers 5 to 8 at slot y = W//2-1 to create the shorter horizontal bar of the "F":
```python
for layer in range(5, 9):
    ab_drop('b11', W//2-1)
```

6. Drop the b31 block on layer 8 at slot y = W//2-2 to create the bottom left horizontal bar of the "F":
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2-2)
```

7. Drop the b31 block on layer 8 at slot y = W//2 to create the bottom right horizontal bar of the "F":
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

8. Finally, drop the b11 block on layer 9 at slot y = W//2-1 to create the middle horizontal bar of the "F":
```python
ab_drop('b11', W//2-1)
```

Note that the exact coordinates and sequence of dropping blocks may vary, but the above steps ensure that the structure is stable and resembles the uppercase character "F". You can adapt the above code and modify the slots and block types as per your requirements.
