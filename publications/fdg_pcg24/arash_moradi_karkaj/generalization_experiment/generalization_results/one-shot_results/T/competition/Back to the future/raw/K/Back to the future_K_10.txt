To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "K" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code: structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

2. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the b31 block in the middle of the structure (slot 10).

3. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure that the current structure and the resulting structure are stable and do not collapse.

4. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the b13 block above the b31 block, aligned with its center (slot 10).

5. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure that the current structure and the resulting structure are stable and do not collapse.

6. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the b13 block above the previously dropped b13 block, aligned with its center (slot 10).

7. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure that the current structure and the resulting structure are stable and do not collapse.

8. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the b11 block above the b31 block, aligned with its center (slot 10).

9. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure that the current structure and the resulting structure are stable and do not collapse.

10. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the b11 block above the previously dropped b11 block, aligned with its center (slot 10).

11. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure that the current structure and the resulting structure are stable and do not collapse.

12. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the b11 block to the left of the previously dropped b11 blocks, aligned with its center (slot 6).

13. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure that the current structure and the resulting structure are stable and do not collapse.

14. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the b11 block to the right of the previously dropped b11 blocks, aligned with its center (slot 14).

15. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure that the current structure and the resulting structure are stable and do not collapse.

16. The final structure should resemble the uppercase character "K" and meet all the hard constraints.

Note: The specific coordinates and number of drops may vary depending on the stability of the structure and the constraints imposed by the block types. The steps above provide a general guideline to generate a stable structure resembling the uppercase character "K".
