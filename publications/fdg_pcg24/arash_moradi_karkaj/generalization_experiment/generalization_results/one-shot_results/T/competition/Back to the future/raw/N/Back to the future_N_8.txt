To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "N" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) upwards.

3. Create a function to check the stability of the structure after each block drop. This function will check if the block being dropped has stable support below it. If not, it will adjust the drop position until a stable position is found.

```python
def is_stable(drop_pos, block_width):
    stable = True
    
    for i in range(drop_pos[0]+1, H):
        for j in range(drop_pos[1]-block_width//2, drop_pos[1]+block_width//2+1):
            if structure[i][j] == ' ':
                stable = False
                break
        if not stable:
            break
    
    return stable
```

4. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a specific order and position that resembles the "N" shape. Adjust the drop positions based on the stability check.

```python
def build_N_structure():
    # Drop the first vertical block (b13) in the leftmost slot (slot 0)
    ab_drop("b13", 0)
    
    # Drop the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block at slot 1
    ab_drop("b31", 1)
    
    # Drop the second vertical block (b13) on top of the horizontal block at slot 2
    ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

5. Call the `is_stable()` function after each block drop to ensure stability.

```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # check stability before placing the block
    if is_stable(drop_pos, len(x)):
        # place the block on the structure
        structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
        return drop_pos
    else:
        # adjust drop position until a stable position is found
        while not is_stable(drop_pos, len(x)):
            drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]+1, drop_pos[1])
        
        # place the block on the structure
        structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
        return drop_pos
```

6. Continue building the structure by adding more blocks in the appropriate positions to complete the "N" shape.

7. Finally, print the resulting structure to see if it resembles the uppercase letter "N".

```python
def print_structure():
    for row in structure:
        print(' '.join(row))
```

With these steps and functions in place, you can generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "N". The specific positions and order of block drops can be adjusted to meet the constraints and create a diverse set of structures.
