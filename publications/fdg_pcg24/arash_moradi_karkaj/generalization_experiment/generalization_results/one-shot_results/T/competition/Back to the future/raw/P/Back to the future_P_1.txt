To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "P" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b11 block at slot 1 and layer 0 to form the vertical line of the "P". This block will serve as the stable base for the rest of the structure.
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

3. Drop the b31 block at slot 1 and layer 1 to form the top horizontal line of the "P". This block will be supported by the b11 block below it.
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Drop two b31 blocks at slots 0 and 2 and layer 2 to form the middle horizontal line of the "P". These blocks will be supported by the b31 block above them and the b11 block below them.
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

5. Drop the b31 block at slot 1 and layer 3 to form the bottom horizontal line of the "P". This block will be supported by the b31 blocks above it and the b11 block below it.
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

6. Drop the b31 block at slot 1 and layer 4 to form the top vertical line of the "P". This block will be supported by the b31 block below it.
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

7. Drop the b13 block at slots 0 and 2 and layer 4 to form the middle vertical line of the "P". These blocks will be supported by the b31 blocks above them.
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

8. Drop the b31 block at slots 0 and 2 and layer 7 to form the bottom vertical line of the "P". These blocks will be supported by the b31 blocks above them.
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

9. Drop the b31 block at slot 0 and layer 10 to form the top horizontal line of the "P". This block will be supported by the b31 block below it.
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

10. Drop the b31 block at slots 0 and 2 and layer 11 to form the middle horizontal line of the "P". These blocks will be supported by the b31 block above them.
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

11. Drop the b31 block at slot 1 and layer 12 to form the bottom horizontal line of the "P". This block will be supported by the b31 blocks above it.
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

12. Drop the b11 block at slot 1 and layer 15 to complete the structure of the "P". This block will be supported by the b31 blocks above it.
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

After following these steps, the `structure` grid will represent a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "P". The blocks will be dropped in a way that meets all the hard constraints and provides stable support for each other.
