# Below is an example solution for generating a structure resembling the letter "S" using the ab_drop() function:

ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 11)

# Explanation:
# The first ab_drop() function call drops a vertical block ('b13') at column 9, creating the bottom part of the middle curve of the "S".

# The second ab_drop() function call drops a horizontal block ('b31') at column 9, aligning with the vertical block to create the middle part of the "S".

# The third ab_drop() function call drops another vertical block ('b13') at column 11, creating the top part of the right curve of the "S".

# Note: The solution provided is just one example and there may be multiple valid solutions for generating an "S" shape using the ab_drop() function.
