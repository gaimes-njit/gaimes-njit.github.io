First, let's initialize the field:

```python
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

To form the letter "H", we can start by placing a b31 brick at the bottom:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

We can then place a b11 brick on top of the b31 brick to form the vertical part of the "H":

```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

Finally, we'll place another b31 brick next to the previous one to form the horizontal part of the "H":

```python
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

The final code would look like this:

```python
field = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

This code will generate the required "H" shape, satisfying the stability and boundary collision conditions.
