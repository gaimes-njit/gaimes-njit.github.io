To form the shape resembling the letter "H" using the available bricks, we can start by analyzing the structure of the letter.

The letter "H" consists of three vertical rectangular bricks (b13) and two horizontal rectangular bricks (b31). We can visualize it as follows:

```
-----
|   |
-----
| H |
-----
|   |
-----
```

Now let's generate the required structure using the ab_drop(x, y) function to place the bricks on the field:

```python
# Map initialization
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check stability of bricks
def is_stable():
    for y in range(1, 16):
        for x in range(20):
            if field[y][x] != 0 and field[y-1][x] == 0:
                return False
    return True

# Function to check boundary collisions
def is_within_boundaries(x_position, x_length):
    if x_position < 0 or x_position + x_length > 20:
        return False
    return True

# Place b13 bricks
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Upper segment
ab_drop('b13', 5)  # Lower segment

# Place b31 bricks
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 7)

# Check stability and boundary collisions
if not is_stable() or not is_within_boundaries(3, 3) or not is_within_boundaries(7, 3):
    raise Exception("Invalid structure, not satisfying stability or boundary collisions.")

# Display the field
for row in field[::-1]:
    print('|'.join([' ' if cell == 0 else 'H' for cell in row]))
    print('-----')
```

After executing the code above, the output will display the field with the shape of the letter "H" formed by the bricks.

Note: The code provided assumes the existence of the ab_drop() function, but the implementation of this function is not provided. The code only focuses on generating the required structure and checking for stability and boundary collisions.
