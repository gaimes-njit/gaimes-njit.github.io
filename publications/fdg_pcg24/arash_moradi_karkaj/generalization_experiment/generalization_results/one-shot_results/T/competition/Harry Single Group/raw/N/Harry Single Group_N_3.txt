To form the shape resembling the letter "N" using the given bricks, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the field: We need to create a 2D grid with dimensions 20x16 to represent the field. Each cell can be empty or occupied by a brick.

2. Place the first brick (b13): We can drop a b13 brick starting from the x_position = 0 using the ab_drop('b13', x_position) function. This will occupy the cells (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2).

3. Place the second brick (b11): We can drop a b11 brick starting from the x_position = 2. This will occupy the cell (2, 0).

4. Place the third brick (b31): We can drop a b31 brick starting from the x_position = 6. This will occupy the cells (5, 3), (6, 3), and (7, 3).

5. Place the fourth brick (b31): Next, we drop another b31 brick starting from the x_position = 12. This will occupy the cells (11, 6), (12, 6), and (13, 6).

Here is the Python code to generate the required structure:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the field
field = [[False] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Step 2: Place the first brick (b13)
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Step 3: Place the second brick (b11)
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Step 4: Place the third brick (b31)
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Step 5: Place the fourth brick (b31)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

By following these steps, we have formed the shape resembling the letter "N" using the given bricks.
