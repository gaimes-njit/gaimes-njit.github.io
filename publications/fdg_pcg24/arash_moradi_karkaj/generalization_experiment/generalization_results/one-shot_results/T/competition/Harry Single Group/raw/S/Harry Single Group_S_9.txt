First, let's initialize our field with an empty map:

```python
map = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

To create the shape resembling the letter "S", we can start by placing the horizontal brick (b31) at the bottom-left corner of the field. We can do this by calling `ab_drop('b31', 0)` with an x_position of 0. This will place the b31 brick at the bottom of the field, occupying the cells (0, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0):

```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

Next, we need to place the vertical brick (b13) on top of the horizontal brick. We can call `ab_drop('b13', 0)` with an x_position of 1. This will place the b13 brick above the b31 brick, occupying the cells (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3):

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Finally, we need to place another horizontal brick (b31) on top of the vertical brick. We can call `ab_drop('b31', 0)` with an x_position of 2. This will place the b31 brick above the b13 brick, occupying the cells (2, 4), (3, 4), and (4, 4):

```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

With these steps, we have created the shape resembling the letter "S" while satisfying the important notes of stability and avoiding boundary collisions.
