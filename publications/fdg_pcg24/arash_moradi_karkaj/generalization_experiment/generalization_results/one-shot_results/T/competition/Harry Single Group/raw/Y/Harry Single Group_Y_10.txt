To generate the shape resembling the letter "Y" using the available props and function, we need to carefully plan the placement of each brick to ensure stability and avoid boundary collisions.

First, we initialize the field and set it to empty by mapping each cell to 0:

``` python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, we start placing the bricks one by one to form the shape resembling the letter "Y".

Step 1: Place the vertical brick b13 at (5,0):

``` python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

After this step, the cells (5, 0), (5, 1), and (5, 2) will be occupied.

Step 2: Place the horizontal brick b31 at (4,3):

``` python
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

After this step, the cells (4, 3), (5, 3), and (6, 3) will be occupied.

Step 3: Place another horizontal brick b31 at (1,3):

``` python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

After this step, the cells (1, 3), (2, 3), and (3, 3) will be occupied.

Step 4: Place the square brick b11 at (1,4):

``` python
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

After this step, the cell (1, 4) will be occupied.

Finally, we have successfully generated the required structure resembling the letter "Y".

Here is the complete code:

``` python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```
