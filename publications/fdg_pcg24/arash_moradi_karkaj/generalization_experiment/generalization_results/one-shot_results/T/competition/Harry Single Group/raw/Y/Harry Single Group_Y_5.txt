To form a shape resembling the letter "Y", we can start by using the b13 brick to create the vertical stem of the letter. We'll place it with an x_position of 5, starting from the top of the field and dropping it until it contacts the ground. Then, we'll use the b31 brick to create the two horizontal arms of the letter.

```
# Initialize the field with all cells set to "empty"
field = [["empty" for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the b13 brick to form the vertical stem
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Drop the first b31 brick to form the left arm
ab_drop('b31', 4)

# Drop the second b31 brick to form the right arm
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

After executing the code above, the cells occupied by the bricks will be as follows:

For the b13 brick:
(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2)

For the first b31 brick:
(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)

For the second b31 brick:
(7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3)

To ensure stability, we can check the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot point (in this case, the pivot point is the cell at the bottom of the stem where the horizontal arms are attached). Since both arms have the same number of occupied cells on the left and right sides, the structure remains stable.

Additionally, by placing the bricks starting from an x_position of 4 for the left arm and 8 for the right arm, we avoid any boundary collisions and ensure that the occupied cells of the bricks do not exceed the boundaries of the field.
