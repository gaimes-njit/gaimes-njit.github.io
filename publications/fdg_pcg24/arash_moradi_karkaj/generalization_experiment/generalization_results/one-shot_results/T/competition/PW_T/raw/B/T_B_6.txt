Task: Generate uppercase English letter "B" using the mentioned command and Block Types in the defined environment. 

To generate the letter "B", we can break it down into three parts:
1. The vertical stroke on the left side of the letter.
2. The top horizontal stroke of the letter.
3. The bottom horizontal stroke of the letter.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "B":

```
ab_drop('b13',1)  # Place a vertical block at position 1 for the left stroke
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place a horizontal block at position 1 for the top stroke
ab_drop('b31',7)  # Place a horizontal block at position 7 for the bottom stroke
ab_drop('b31',10) # Place a horizontal block at position 10 for the bottom stroke
```

Please note that the commands above assume that the grid is empty before executing the sequence. If there are existing blocks in the grid, the commands should be adjusted accordingly to avoid collision with existing blocks.
