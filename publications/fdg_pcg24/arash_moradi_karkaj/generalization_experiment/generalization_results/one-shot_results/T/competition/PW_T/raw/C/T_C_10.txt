Task Solution:

```
# Place the blocks to form the letter 'C'

ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the horizontal block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # Place the vertical block at position 7
```

Explanation:
To create the letter 'C', we need to use a combination of horizontal and vertical blocks. The letter 'C' has three horizontal segments and two vertical segments. We start by placing a horizontal block at position 1. Then, we place a vertical block at position 1 to form the left vertical segment of the letter 'C'. Next, we place another horizontal block at position 4 to form the top horizontal segment. We continue by placing a horizontal block at position 7 to form the bottom horizontal segment. Finally, we place a vertical block at position 7 to complete the right vertical segment of the letter 'C'.
