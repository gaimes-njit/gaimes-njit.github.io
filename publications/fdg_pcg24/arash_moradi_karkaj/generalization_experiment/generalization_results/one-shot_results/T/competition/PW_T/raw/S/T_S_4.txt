To generate the uppercase letter "S", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "S" using the block types mentioned in the instructions. Each command places a block at a specific position along the width of the grid.
