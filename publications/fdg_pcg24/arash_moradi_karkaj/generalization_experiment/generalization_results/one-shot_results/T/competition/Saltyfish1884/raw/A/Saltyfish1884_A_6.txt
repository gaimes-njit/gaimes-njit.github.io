To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "A" while meeting all hard constraints, we can approach the problem step by step using the ab_drop() function.

Step 1: Create the structure grid
Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base blocks
To meet the stability constraint, we need to start by placing the base blocks on the bottom layer (layer 0). We can use the ab_drop() function to drop b11 blocks at the suitable slot positions. The slots used to represent the character "A" will be the stable base.

Step 3: Determine the shape of the structure
To resemble the character "A", we need to consider the shape of the structure. The "A" character consists of two diagonal lines connected by a horizontal line. We can achieve this shape by using a combination of b13 and b31 blocks.

Step 4: Place the diagonal blocks
To create the diagonal lines of the "A" character, we can use ab_drop() to drop b13 blocks at specific slot positions in a diagonal pattern. These blocks will be dropped above the stable base, following the stability rules.

Step 5: Place the horizontal line
To complete the "A" character, we need to place the horizontal line connecting the two diagonal lines. We can use ab_drop() to drop b31 blocks at specific slot positions, aligning them with the diagonal lines.

Step 6: Finalize the structure
After placing all the blocks, the structure should resemble the character "A". You can print the structure to verify if it meets all the constraints and resembles the given character.

Here's an example implementation to generate a new structure that resembles the character "A":
```python
# Step 1: Create the structure grid
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Step 2: Place the base blocks
for i in range(4, 16):
    ab_drop('b11', 9)
    ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Step 3: Determine the shape of the structure
# Skip this step as we already know the shape should resemble "A"

# Step 4: Place the diagonal blocks
for i in range(0, 8):
    ab_drop('b13', 4+i)
    ab_drop('b13', 15-i)

# Step 5: Place the horizontal line
for i in range(4, 16):
    ab_drop('b31', i)

# Step 6: Finalize the structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Make sure to satisfy the stability constraint by following the stability rules mentioned in step 5.1. Additionally, try to minimize boundary intrusion as much as possible, considering the soft constraint mentioned in 5.2.
