To generate a stable structure resembling the character "A" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base block (b11) at the bottom layer (layer 0) and in the center slot.

```python
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
```

Step 3: Place the two vertical blocks (b13) on top of the base block, aligned with the slots on either side.

```python
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 - 1)  # Left vertical block
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 + 1)  # Right vertical block
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal block (b31) above the center slot, on top of the vertical blocks.

```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```

This structure resembles the character "A" and meets the stability constraint since the blocks are placed on a solid base. 

Additionally, it does not violate the boundary intrusion constraint since the blocks are placed within the map's boundary.

Note: The specific position and order of block placement may vary depending on the implementation of the ab_drop() function and the given starting condition of the structure. The provided steps assume that the initial structure is empty and the ab_drop() function follows the mentioned rules.
