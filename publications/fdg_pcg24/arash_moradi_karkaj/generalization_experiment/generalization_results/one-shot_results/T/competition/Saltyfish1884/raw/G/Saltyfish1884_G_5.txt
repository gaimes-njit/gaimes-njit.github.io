To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "G", we need to follow the given constraints and use the ab_drop() function appropriately. Here's how we can approach it step by step:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b13 block to create the middle part of the "G" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

3. Drop the b11 blocks to create the left and right parts of the "G" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
```

4. Drop the b31 block to create the horizontal part of the "G" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

5. Drop the b13 block to create the bottom part of the "G" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

6. The resulting structure will resemble the character "G" while meeting all the hard constraints.
