To generate a structure that resembles the character "H" while meeting all the given hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given code:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) to form the stable base at the bottom of the structure. This ensures stability and prevents overhangs.

```python
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop('b11', i)
```

3. Place the middle horizontal block (b31) on top of the base blocks to form the middle part of the "H" character. Ensure stability by placing it on a solid base block.

```python
x = int(W/2)  # Center slot for the middle block
ab_drop('b31', x)
```

4. Place the vertical blocks (b13) on both sides of the middle block to complete the "H" character. Ensure stability by placing them on solid base blocks.

```python
ab_drop('b13', x-1)  # Left vertical block
ab_drop('b13', x+1)  # Right vertical block
```

5. The structure should now resemble the letter "H" and meet all the hard stability constraints.

6. To generate the final result, print the structure using the following code:

```python
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

Note: The exact positions and order of block placement may differ based on the specific requirements and any additional constraints not mentioned in the given problem description. Adjustments may be needed to meet any specific boundary constraints or desired aesthetic preferences.
