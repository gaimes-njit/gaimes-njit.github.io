To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I," we need to follow the constraints and use the ab_drop() function to place suitable blocks in the correct slots and layers. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by considering the stability constraint (5.1). Place a b31 block on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Since the character "I" has a vertical shape, we can use a b13 block as the base and place it in the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

3. Next, we need to ensure that the blocks are placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing. We can follow a sequential approach and place b11 blocks on top of the base block. Starting from the left slot, drop b11 blocks evenly spaced across the remaining slots:
```python
for i in range(0, 20):
    ab_drop('b11', i)
```

4. After placing the b11 blocks, we need to make sure that the structure is not separated. To achieve this, we can reinforce the structure by adding b13 blocks on both sides of the base block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Place b13 block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 19)  # Place b13 block on the right side
```

5. Finally, we need to ensure that the structure does not intrude on the map's boundaries, as specified in constraint 5.2. Since we have already placed blocks in the leftmost and rightmost slots, there is no need for any additional adjustments.

The resulting code, considering all the steps above, would look like this:

```python
W = 20
H = 16

def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Place base block in the center

for i in range(0, 20):  # Place b11 blocks evenly spaced
    ab_drop('b11', i)

ab_drop('b13', 0)  # Place b13 block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 19)  # Place b13 block on the right side

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

Please note that the above code assumes that the ab_drop() function and the structure initialization have been provided to you. The code will generate a stable structure resembling the character "I" while meeting all the given constraints.
