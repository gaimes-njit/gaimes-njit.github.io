To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "O" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully place the blocks using the ab_drop() function. Let's break down the steps to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by placing a b11 block at the center bottom of the structure as the base:
```python
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
```

3. Place a b31 block on top of the base to prevent overhangs:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```

4. Place two b13 blocks on either side of the b31 block to complete the lower half of the "O" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 - 1) # Left side
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 + 1) # Right side
```

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 on top of the existing blocks to create the upper half of the "O" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 - 1) # Left side
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 + 1) # Right side
```

6. The resulting structure should resemble the character "O" and meet all hard constraints.

Here is an example of how the final structure could look like:
```
__________
__________
__________
__b11_____
__b31_____
__b13__b13_
__b13__b13_
__b31_____
__b13__b13_
__b13__b13_
__b31_____
__b11_____
__________
__________
__________
__________
```
Note: This is just one possible solution, and there may be multiple valid structures that meet the requirements.
