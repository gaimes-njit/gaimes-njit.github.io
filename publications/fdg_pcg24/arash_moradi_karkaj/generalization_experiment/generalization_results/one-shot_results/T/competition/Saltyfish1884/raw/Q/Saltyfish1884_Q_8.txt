To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q" using the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base block (b11) on layer 0 at the center slot.
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

Step 3: Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the base block, aligned with the left slot.
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block, aligned with the center slot.
```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

Step 5: Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block, aligned with the right slot.
```
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

Step 6: Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the horizontal blocks, aligned with the left slot.
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Step 7: Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the horizontal blocks, aligned with the right slot.
```
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

Step 8: Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical blocks, aligned with the center slot.
```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

Step 9: Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the horizontal block, aligned with the left slot.
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

Step 10: Place the vertical block (b13) on top of the horizontal block, aligned with the right slot.
```
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

Step 11: Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical blocks, aligned with the center slot.
```
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

This sequence of steps will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q" while satisfying all the given hard constraints. The resulting structure will be stored in the `structure` variable.
