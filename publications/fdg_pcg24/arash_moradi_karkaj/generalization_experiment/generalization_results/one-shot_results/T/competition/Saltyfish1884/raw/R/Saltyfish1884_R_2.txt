To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid by creating an empty WxH grid using the provided code:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Determine the dropping position and order of the blocks. Since stability is a crucial constraint, we need to carefully consider the position and order of the blocks. We can start by placing a b11 block at the bottom left corner of the structure to serve as the base.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

Step 3: Using the ab_drop() function, drop a b31 block centered at slot 1 on top of the base block. This will create the vertical part of the character "R".

```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 4: Drop a b13 block centered at slot 2 on top of the vertical part to complete the shape of the character "R".

```python
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Step 5: Check the stability of the structure. Ensure that the b31 block is placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Also, make sure that the blocks are placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.

Step 6: Check and adjust the position of the blocks to meet the no boundary intrusion constraint. Make sure that no blocks extend beyond the boundaries of the map.

Step 7: Print the final structure to check if it resembles the character "R" and meets all the given requirements.

```python
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The above steps outline a general approach to generate a structure resembling the character "R" while meeting the given constraints. However, depending on the specific definitions and constraints of the block-stacking problem, further adjustments may be required to ensure stability and boundary intrusion constraints are satisfied.
