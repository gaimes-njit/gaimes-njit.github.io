To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "V" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with the given dimensions:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b13 block as the base of the structure at the bottom layer (layer 0) and at the center slot (slot 9):
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

3. Place two b31 blocks on top of the base, connecting at their ends to form a "V" shape. Drop the first b31 block at layer 1 and the leftmost slot (slot 0):
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```
Then, drop the second b31 block at the same layer (layer 1) and the rightmost slot (slot 19):
```python
ab_drop('b31', 19)
```

4. Place two b11 blocks on top of the b31 blocks to complete the "V" shape. Drop the first b11 block at layer 2 and the slot next to the leftmost slot (slot 1):
```python
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```
Then, drop the second b11 block at the same layer (layer 2) and the slot next to the rightmost slot (slot 18):
```python
ab_drop('b11', 18)
```

5. The resulting structure should resemble the character "V" and meet all the stability constraints. The structure should not be separated, and the blocks should not intrude on the map's boundary.

Here is an example of how the structure may look like:

```
     b13     
     |      
b31--b31     
|    |      
b11--b11   
```

Note: The specific shape and arrangement of the blocks may vary depending on the exact dropping positions and order determined by the ab_drop() function.
