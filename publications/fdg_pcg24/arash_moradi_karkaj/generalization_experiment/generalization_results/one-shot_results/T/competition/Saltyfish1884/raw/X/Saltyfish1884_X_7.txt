To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to break down the process step by step. Here is an approach:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. First, we need to drop the b13 blocks to form the main diagonal of the "X" shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop b13 blocks at appropriate positions. For example:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Drop the first b13 block at slot position 4
ab_drop('b13', 8)  # Drop the second b13 block at slot position 8
```
This will create a stable diagonal line in the structure.

3. Next, we need to add b31 blocks to form the arms of the "X" shape. Place them on the base or on top of the b13 blocks to ensure stability.
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Drop the first b31 block on the base at slot position 2
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Drop the second b31 block on the base at slot position 10
```
This will create the arms of the "X" shape.

4. Finally, add b11 blocks to fill the gaps and complete the "X" shape.
```
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Drop the first b11 block in the center of the "X"
ab_drop('b11', 12)  # Drop the second b11 block in the center of the "X"
```
This will fill the gaps between the b31 blocks and complete the "X" shape.

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X" while meeting all hard constraints. Keep in mind that the dropping position and order are crucial, and you may need to adjust them to achieve stability and meet all constraints.
