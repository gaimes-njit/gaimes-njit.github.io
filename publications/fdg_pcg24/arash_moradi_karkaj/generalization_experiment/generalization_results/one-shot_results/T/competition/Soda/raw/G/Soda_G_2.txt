To create a structure in the shape of the letter "G", we can break it down into multiple blocks and place them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Place a row block "b31" at the bottom of the grid, centered at x_position = 9:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Place a column block "b13" above the row block, centered at x_position = 10:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

3. Place a row block "b31" above the column block, centered at x_position = 11:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

4. Place a column block "b13" above the row block, centered at x_position = 12:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 12)
```

5. Place a square block "b11" above the column block, centered at x_position = 10:
```python
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

6. Place a row block "b31" above the column block, centered at x_position = 8:
```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

7. Place a column block "b13" above the row block, centered at x_position = 9:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

This implementation will create a structure in the shape of the letter "G" in the grid. Each block is placed in a stable position and follows the bottom-to-top order.
