To generate the structure in the shape of the capital letter "H", we can break it down into three blocks - two vertical bars and one horizontal bar.

First, we will place the two vertical bars. We will start from the left side of the grid and move towards the right side. For stability, we will place the blocks from bottom to top.

We will use the "b31" block type for the vertical bars, as it has a size of 3*1.

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Place first vertical bar at x_position = 2
ab_drop("b31", 17)  # Place second vertical bar at x_position = 17
```

Next, we will place the horizontal bar. We will place it in the middle of the two vertical bars.

We will use the "b13" block type for the horizontal bar, as it has a size of 1*3.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place horizontal bar at x_position = 9
```

The complete implementation, containing only the ab_drop() calls, is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Place first vertical bar at x_position = 2
ab_drop("b31", 17)  # Place second vertical bar at x_position = 17
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place horizontal bar at x_position = 9
```
