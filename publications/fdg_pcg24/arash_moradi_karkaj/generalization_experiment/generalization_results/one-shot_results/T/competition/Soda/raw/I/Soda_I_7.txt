To create a structure in the shape of the capital letter "I" using the ab_drop() function, we need to drop four column blocks vertically and center them at specific slots. The slot positions can be determined based on the width (W) of the grid. 

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Drop the first column block in the center at x_position=9
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Drop the second column block in the center at x_position=10
ab_drop("b13", 11)  # Drop the third column block in the center at x_position=11
ab_drop("b13", 12)  # Drop the fourth column block in the center at x_position=12

This implementation ensures that the blocks are dropped in a bottom-to-top fashion, creating a structure that looks like the letter "I" when the level reaches structural stability.
