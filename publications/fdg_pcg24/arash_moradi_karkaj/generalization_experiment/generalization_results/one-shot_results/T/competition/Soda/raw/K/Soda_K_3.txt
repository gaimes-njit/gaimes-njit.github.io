To create the letter "K" using the ab_drop() function, we can start by dropping the base of the letter, which consists of two blocks placed vertically. Then, we can drop the two diagonal arms of the letter. Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Drop the base blocks
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 12)

# Drop the left arm
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)

# Drop the right arm
ab_drop("b11", 13)
ab_drop("b11", 14)
ab_drop("b11", 15)
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are stacked from bottom to top and creates a structure that resembles the letter "K". Please note that this implementation assumes there are no existing blocks on the grid. If there are other blocks already present, you may need to adjust the x_position value to avoid collision with those blocks.
