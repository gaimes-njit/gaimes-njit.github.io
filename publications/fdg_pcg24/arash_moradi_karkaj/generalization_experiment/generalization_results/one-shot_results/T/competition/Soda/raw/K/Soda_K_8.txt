To create the structure of the letter "K" in the level, we can start by placing the base blocks, followed by the vertical bar, and finally the top bar. We will use the "b31" block for the base, the "b13" block for the vertical bar, and another "b31" block for the top bar.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)  # Place the base block
ab_drop("b13", 6)  # Place the vertical bar
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Place the top bar
```

In this implementation, the base block is centered at x_position=6, so it occupies cells (5, 0), (6, 0), and (7, 0). The vertical bar is also centered at x_position=6, occupying cells (5, 1), (6, 1), and (7, 1). The top bar is centered at x_position=4, occupying cells (3, 2), (4, 2), and (5, 2).

This arrangement should create a structure that resembles the letter "K".
