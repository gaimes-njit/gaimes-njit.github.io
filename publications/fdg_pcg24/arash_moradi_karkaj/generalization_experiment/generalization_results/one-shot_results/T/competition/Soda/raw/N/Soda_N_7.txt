To create a structure that looks like the letter "N", we can break it down into two parts: the left vertical side and the right vertical side. Each side can be created using a column block (b13) and a row block (b31).

Here is the complete implementation to generate the "N" structure:

```python
# Create left side of the "N"
ab_drop("b13", 7)  # Place column block on position 7
ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Place row block on position 8

# Create right side of the "N"
ab_drop("b13", 12)  # Place column block on position 12
ab_drop("b31", 13)  # Place row block on position 13
```

Explanation:
- The first `ab_drop("b13", 7)` call places a column block at x_position=7, which will cover cells (6,0), (7,0), and (8,0).
- The second `ab_drop("b31", 8)` call places a row block at x_position=8, which will cover cells (7,1), (7,0), and (7,-1).
- These two blocks together form the left vertical side of the "N".
- The third `ab_drop("b13", 12)` call places a column block at x_position=12, which will cover cells (11,0), (12,0), and (13,0).
- The fourth `ab_drop("b31", 13)` call places a row block at x_position=13, which will cover cells (12,1), (12,0), and (12,-1).
- These two blocks together form the right vertical side of the "N".

The end result will be a structure that looks like the letter "N", with each side being balanced and well-supported.
