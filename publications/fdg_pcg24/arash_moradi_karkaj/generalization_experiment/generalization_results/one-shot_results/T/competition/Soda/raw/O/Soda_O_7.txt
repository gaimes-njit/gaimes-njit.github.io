To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "O", we can start by placing a row block in the middle of the grid. Then, we can place a column block on top of it, centered in the middle as well. Finally, we can place another row block on top, completing the shape of the letter "O". 

Here is the implementation:

```
# Step 1: Place the base row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
# This will place the row block centered at the 10th column (index 9)

# Step 2: Place the column block on top
ab_drop("b13", 9)
# This will place the column block centered at the 10th column (index 9)

# Step 3: Place the top row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
# This will place the row block centered at the 10th column (index 9)
```

The implementation above follows the bottom-to-top approach and ensures that the blocks are stable and well-supported. The resulting structure should resemble the letter "O" when viewed from the top-down orientation.
