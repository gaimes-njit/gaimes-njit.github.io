To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "O" in a level, we can start by placing a row block (b31) at the center of the bottom row. This will serve as the base of the "O" shape.

Next, we can place a column block (b13) directly above the row block, centered in the same column. This will form the vertical part of the "O" shape.

Finally, we can place another row block (b31) directly above the column block, centered in the same row. This will complete the circular part of the "O" shape.

Here is the code implementation to generate the "O" shape:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place row block at x_position=9
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place column block above the row block
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place another row block above the column block
```

This implementation will create a stable structure that resembles the capital letter "O". The blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability.
