To create the letter "P" in the 2D grid, we can break it down into two blocks: a vertical pipe and a bottom bar. 

Here is the step-by-step implementation to create the letter "P":

1. Place the vertical pipe:
   - Use the "b31" block type to create a vertical pipe.
   - Drop the block at x_position=9 to center it.
   - The vertical pipe will occupy cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).
   ```
   ab_drop("b31", 9)
   ```

2. Place the bottom bar:
   - Use the "b13" block type to create a bottom bar.
   - Drop the block at x_position=9 to center it.
   - The bottom bar will occupy cells (8, 1), (9, 1), and (10, 1).
   ```
   ab_drop("b13", 9)
   ```

Complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
