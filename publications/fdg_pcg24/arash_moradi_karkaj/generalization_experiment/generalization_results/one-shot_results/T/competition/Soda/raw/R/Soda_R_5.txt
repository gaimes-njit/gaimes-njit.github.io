To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "R," we will need to place blocks strategically to form the shape.

1. First, we will start with a row block ("b31") placed at the bottom center of the grid to form the base of the letter.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Next, we will place a column block ("b13") vertically aligned with the right end of the base block to form the vertical line of the letter.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

3. Finally, we will place another row block ("b31") horizontally aligned with the top of the vertical line to form the diagonal line of the letter.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```

This completes the structure that resembles the capital letter "R". The complete implementation would be:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```

By following these steps, we have built a stable structure that resembles the target letter "R".
