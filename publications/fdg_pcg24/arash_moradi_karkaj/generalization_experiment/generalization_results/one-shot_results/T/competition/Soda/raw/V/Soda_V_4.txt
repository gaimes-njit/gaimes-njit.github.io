First, let's create the base of the "V" shape. We can use a row block ("b31") centered at position 9. This will occupy cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, let's add the left side of the "V" shape. We can use a column block ("b13") centered at position 7. This will occupy cells (7, 1), (7, 0), and (7, -1).

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
```

Finally, let's add the right side of the "V" shape. We can use another column block ("b13") centered at position 11. This will occupy cells (11, 1), (11, 0), and (11, -1).

```
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```
