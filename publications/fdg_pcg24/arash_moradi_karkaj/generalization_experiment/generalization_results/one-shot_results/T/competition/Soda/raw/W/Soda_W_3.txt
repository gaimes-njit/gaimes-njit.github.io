To generate the letter "W" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two diagonal blocks and one horizontal block.

1. Diagonal Blocks:
We start by placing the two diagonal blocks of type "b13" at the bottom corners of the level. This will form the two outer edges of the "W" shape.

ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 19)

2. Horizontal Block:
Next, we place the horizontal block of type "b31" at the center of the level. This will connect the two diagonal blocks and complete the "W" shape.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

This completes the implementation to generate the letter "W" in the level. The final code block with the ab_drop() calls is as follows:

ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b13", 19)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
