To generate the structure that looks like a capital "X", we can break it down into two diagonal blocks and a center block. 

Step 1: Drop the diagonal blocks
We start by dropping the two diagonal blocks at the top corners of the grid. Since the blocks are positioned at the top, they will not be affected by gravity.

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 18)
```

Step 2: Drop the center block
Next, we drop the center block between the two diagonal blocks. To achieve stability, we need to ensure that the center block is well-supported by the two diagonal blocks. We can achieve this by positioning the center block slightly above the bottom of the diagonal blocks.

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 18)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```
