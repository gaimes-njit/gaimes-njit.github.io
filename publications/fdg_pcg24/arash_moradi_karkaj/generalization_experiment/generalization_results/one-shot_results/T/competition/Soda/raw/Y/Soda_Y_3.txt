To create the structure of a capital "Y" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical columns and a horizontal bar connecting them. 

First, we will create the two vertical columns using the "b31" block type.

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

Next, we will create the horizontal bar using the "b13" block type. Since the bar needs to be centered between the two vertical columns, we will place it at x_position=9.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

The complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
