To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "D" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to stack blocks in a specific order and position. Here is a suggested approach:

1. Start by dropping a `b31` block vertically at slot 6 using `ab_drop('b31', 6)`. This block will serve as the vertical part of the "D" character.

2. Next, drop a `b11` block vertically at slot 8 using `ab_drop('b11', 8)`. This block will serve as the top-left part of the "D" character.

3. Drop another `b11` block vertically at slot 10 using `ab_drop('b11', 10)`. This block will serve as the bottom-left part of the "D" character.

4. Finally, drop a `b13` block vertically at slot 8 using `ab_drop('b13', 8)`. This block will serve as the horizontal part of the "D" character.

The resulting structure should resemble the character "D" and meet all the constraints.
