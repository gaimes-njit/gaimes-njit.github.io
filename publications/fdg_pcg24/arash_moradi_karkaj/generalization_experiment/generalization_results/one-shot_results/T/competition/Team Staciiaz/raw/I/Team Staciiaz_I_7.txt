To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "I" and meets all the given constraints, we will use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop blocks in a strategic order and position.

Here's the approach we can follow:

1. Start by dropping a b13 block at slot 9 to create the vertical part of the "I" character. This is stable because the block's weight is evenly distributed around the center.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

2. Next, drop a b31 block at slot 8 to create the top horizontal part of the "I" character. This block will rest on the top of the b13 block.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

3. Finally, drop another b31 block at slot 9 to create the bottom horizontal part of the "I" character. This block will rest on the base layer (layer 0) and connect the vertical and top horizontal parts.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

After executing these steps, the `structure` will represent a stable structure that looks like the character "I" while meeting all the constraints.

Note: The order and position of the block drops are crucial to ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion. By carefully dropping the blocks in a strategic manner, we can achieve the desired structure.
