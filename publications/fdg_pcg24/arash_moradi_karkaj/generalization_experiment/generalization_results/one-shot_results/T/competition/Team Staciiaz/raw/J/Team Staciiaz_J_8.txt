To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "J" and meets all the constraints, the `ab_drop()` function can be used as follows:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop a b11 block at slot 6:
```
ab_drop('b11', 6)
```
This will place a 1x1 block at layer 0 and slot 6.

3. Drop a b11 block at slot 7:
```
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```
This will place another 1x1 block at layer 0 and slot 7.

4. Drop a b11 block at slot 8:
```
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```
This will place another 1x1 block at layer 0 and slot 8.

5. Drop a b11 block at slot 9:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
This will place another 1x1 block at layer 0 and slot 9.

6. Drop a b31 block at slot 8:
```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```
This will place a 3x1 block on top of the 1x1 blocks, spanning slots 7, 8, and 9 in layer 1.

7. Drop a b13 block at slot 9:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
This will place a 1x3 block on top of the 3x1 block, centered at slot 9 in layer 2.

The resulting structure will be a stable "J" shape that satisfies all the constraints.
