To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "N" while satisfying all the constraints, we can utilize the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in the appropriate positions and order.

For the "N" character shape, we can start by dropping a `b13` vertical block at slot 3, followed by a `b31` horizontal block at slot 6, and finally another `b13` vertical block at slot 11.

Here's the step-by-step process to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure grid:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first vertical block `b13` at slot 3:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

3. Drop the horizontal block `b31` at slot 6:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

4. Drop the second vertical block `b13` at slot 11:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "N" and meet the stability constraint since each block is properly placed to distribute the weight evenly. The constraint of no boundary intrusion is also satisfied since the blocks are dropped within the map boundaries.

You can further modify the position and order of the blocks by adjusting the slot numbers in the `ab_drop()` function calls, as long as the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints are maintained.
