To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "O", we can use the `ab_drop()` function and apply the following steps:

1. First, we need to drop a horizontal block (`b31`) at slot 8. This will serve as the base of the structure.
   `ab_drop('b31', 8)`

2. Next, we need to drop two vertical blocks (`b13`) on both sides of the base to form the vertical sides of the "O".
   `ab_drop('b13', 6)` # Drops the left vertical block
   `ab_drop('b13', 10)` # Drops the right vertical block

3. Finally, we need to drop a horizontal block (`b31`) on top of the vertical blocks to complete the "O" shape.
   `ab_drop('b31', 8)` # Drops the top horizontal block

After executing these steps, the `structure` grid will represent a stable structure that looks like the character "O" and meets all the constraints.

Note: The order in which the blocks are dropped is important to ensure stability. The `ab_drop()` function automatically handles the dropping order based on the center positions of the blocks and their sizes.
