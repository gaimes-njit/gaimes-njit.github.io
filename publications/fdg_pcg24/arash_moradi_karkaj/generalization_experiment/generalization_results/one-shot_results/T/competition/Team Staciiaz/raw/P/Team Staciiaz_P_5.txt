To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "P" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we need to carefully place the blocks to ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieving this goal:

1. Initialize the structure grid: 
   ```
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Start by dropping the vertical block (`b13`) at slot 1 to create the base of the "P" shape:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

3. Drop the horizontal block (`b31`) at slot 1 and layer 1 to create the upper part of the "P":
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

4. Drop the vertical block (`b13`) at slot 4 and slot 5 to create the vertical stroke of the "P":
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 4)
   ab_drop('b13', 5)
   ```

5. Drop the square block (`b11`) at slot 4 and layer 4 to complete the "P":
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 4)
   ```

6. The final structure should resemble the character "P" and meet all the constraints.

Note: The above instructions assume that the `ab_drop()` function is already defined and can be called with the specified arguments. Also, make sure to adjust the slot positions and the order of block dropping as needed to meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
