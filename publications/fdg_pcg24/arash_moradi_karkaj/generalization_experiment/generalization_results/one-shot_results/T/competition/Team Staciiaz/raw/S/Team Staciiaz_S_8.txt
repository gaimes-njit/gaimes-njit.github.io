To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "S" and meets all the constraints, you can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided map initialization code.
2. Drop the b31 block at slot 2 using `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.
3. Drop the b31 block at slot 4 using `ab_drop('b31', 4)`.
4. Drop the b31 block at slot 6 using `ab_drop('b31', 6)`.
5. Drop the b31 block at slot 10 using `ab_drop('b31', 10)`.
6. Drop the b31 block at slot 12 using `ab_drop('b31', 12)`.
7. Drop the b31 block at slot 14 using `ab_drop('b31', 14)`.
8. Drop the b31 block at slot 16 using `ab_drop('b31', 16)`.
9. Drop the b13 block at slot 3 using `ab_drop('b13', 3)`.
10. Drop the b13 block at slot 5 using `ab_drop('b13', 5)`.
11. Drop the b13 block at slot 7 using `ab_drop('b13', 7)`.
12. Drop the b13 block at slot 11 using `ab_drop('b13', 11)`.
13. Drop the b13 block at slot 13 using `ab_drop('b13', 13)`.
14. Drop the b13 block at slot 15 using `ab_drop('b13', 15)`.
15. The resulting structure will resemble the character "S" and meet all the constraints.

Note: The exact slot positions and block types used may vary, as long as the resulting structure is stable and resembles the character "S".
