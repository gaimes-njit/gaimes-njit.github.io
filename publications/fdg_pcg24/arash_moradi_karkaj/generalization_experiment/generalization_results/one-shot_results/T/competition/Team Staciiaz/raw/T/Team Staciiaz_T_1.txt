To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "T" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function as follows:

1. First, drop the vertical block `b13` at slot 9 to form the vertical part of the "T" shape. This block should be dropped from layer H (the top layer) to ensure stability.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

2. Next, drop the horizontal block `b31` at slots 7, 8, and 9 to form the horizontal part of the "T" shape. These blocks should be dropped from layer H and placed below the vertical block to ensure stability.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Finally, drop the square block `b11` at slot 9 on the layer below the horizontal blocks. This will complete the structure of the "T" shape. The `ab_drop()` function will automatically determine the appropriate layer and position for this block based on the already dropped blocks, ensuring stability.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

The above set of `ab_drop()` function calls will create a stable structure that looks like the character "T" and meets all the constraints.
