First, we need to determine the necessary placement of blocks to form the letter "W". Here is one possible solution:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
```

In this solution, we start by placing three vertical blocks (`b13`) in slots 0, 1, and 2 to form the left side of the "W". Next, we place a square block (`b11`) on top of the middle vertical block to create the center of the "W". Finally, we place two horizontal blocks (`b31`) in slots 1 and 3 to complete the right side of the "W".

This is just one possible solution, and there are many creative ways to construct the letter "W" using the provided blocks.
