Steps:
1. Drawing the letter "B" with asterisks:
```
*****
*    *
*    *
*****
*    *
*    *
*****
```
2. Verbal listing of asterisks and spaces in each row:
Row 1: 5 asterisks
Row 2: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 3: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 4: 5 asterisks
Row 5: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 6: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 7: 5 asterisks

3. Asterisks = x, Spaces = y:
Row 1: 5x
Row 2: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 3: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 4: 5x
Row 5: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 6: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 7: 5x

4. Writing x and y side-by-side:
Row 1: xxxxx
Row 2: xyxyx
Row 3: xyxyx
Row 4: xxxxx
Row 5: xyxyx
Row 6: xyxyx
Row 7: xxxxx

5. Position of each variable:
Row 1: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
Row 2: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; x-5
Row 3: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; x-5
Row 4: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
Row 5: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; x-5
Row 6: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; x-5
Row 7: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5

6. Sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```
Note: The position "b11" is assumed based on the given instructions, but it can be adjusted accordingly.
