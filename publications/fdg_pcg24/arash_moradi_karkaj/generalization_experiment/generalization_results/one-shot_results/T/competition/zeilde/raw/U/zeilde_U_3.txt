Step 1: Drawing the letter "U" with asterisks

```
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****
```

Step 2: Listing the asterisks and spaces generated in each row:

Row 1: 5 asterisks
Row 2: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 3: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 4: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 5: 5 asterisks

Step 3: Replacing asterisks with "x" and spaces with "y":

Row 1: "xxxxx"
Row 2: "xyyxy"
Row 3: "xyyxy"
Row 4: "xyyxy"
Row 5: "xxxxx"

Step 4: Writing out each "x" and "y" for each row:

Row 1: "xxxxx"
Row 2: "xxyyx"
Row 3: "xxyyx"
Row 4: "xxyyx"
Row 5: "xxxxx"

Step 5: Indicating the position of each variable:

Row 1: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5"
Row 2: "x-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; x-5"
Row 3: "x-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; x-5"
Row 4: "x-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; x-5"
Row 5: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5"

Step 6: Returning a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
