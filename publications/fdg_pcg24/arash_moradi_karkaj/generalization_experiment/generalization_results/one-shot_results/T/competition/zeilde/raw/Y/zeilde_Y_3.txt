1. The letter "Y" can be drawn with asterisks as follows:

```
   *   *  
    * *   
     *    
     *    
     *    
```

2. Line-by-line, the asterisks and spaces generated in each row are as follows:

- Row 1: 3 asterisks, 3 spaces
- Row 2: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
- Row 3: 1 space, 1 asterisk, 1 space
- Row 4: 1 space, 1 asterisk, 1 space
- Row 5: 1 space, 1 asterisk, 1 space

3. Replacing the asterisks with "x" and spaces with "y", the new representation becomes:

- Row 1: 3x, 3y
- Row 2: 1x, 3y, 1x
- Row 3: 1y, 1x, 1y
- Row 4: 1y, 1x, 1y
- Row 5: 1y, 1x, 1y

4. Writing out each x and y side-by-side for each row:

- Row 1: "xxxyyy"
- Row 2: "xyyyx"
- Row 3: "yxy"
- Row 4: "yxy"
- Row 5: "yxy"

5. Indicating position of each variable for each row:

- Row 1: "x-1 x-2 x-3 y-4 y-5 y-6"
- Row 2: "x-1 y-2 y-3 y-4 x-5"
- Row 3: "y-1 x-2 y-3"
- Row 4: "y-1 x-2 y-3"
- Row 5: "y-1 x-2 y-3"

6. The sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row becomes:

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
