Here is an example solution to generate the structure resembling "N":

```python
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the bottom horizontal block (base)
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# Drop the vertical block on the left side
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Drop the top horizontal block (connecting the vertical block and the base)
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# Drop the vertical block on the right side
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Drop the bottom horizontal block (connecting the vertical block and the base)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This solution follows the given constraints and builds the "N" structure from the bottom layer to the top layer, drop by drop. The blocks are positioned in the desired shape and the gravity is taken into account.
