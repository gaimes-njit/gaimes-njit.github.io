To create a stable structure resembling "P" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block horizontally to create the top part of the "P" shape:

```python
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
```

3. Drop the second block vertically to create the stem of the "P" shape:

```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

4. Drop the third block horizontally to complete the bottom part of the "P" shape:

```python
ab_drop('b11', W//2 + 1)
```

Combining these steps, the code block for generating the structure resembling "P" is:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b11', W//2)
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
ab_drop('b11', W//2 + 1)
```

Note: Ensure that the `W` and `H` values are correctly set to 20 and 16, respectively, to match the given constraints.
