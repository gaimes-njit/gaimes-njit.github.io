Here is the proposed solution to generate the structure resembling "Q" while adhering to the given constraints:

```python
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Bottom-left corner square block
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Vertical block on top of the square block
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Horizontal block on top of the vertical block
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Vertical block on top of the horizontal block
ab_drop('b11', 1)

# Vertical block on top-left of the vertical block
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Top horizontal block
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Top-right corner square block
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Top vertical block
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Please note that the positioning of the blocks is crucial in order to satisfy the given constraints. The shape of the "Q" structure is achieved by carefully dropping the blocks in the specified order and positions.
