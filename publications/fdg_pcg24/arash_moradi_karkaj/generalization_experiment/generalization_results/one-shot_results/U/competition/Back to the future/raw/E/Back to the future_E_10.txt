To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "E" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet.
2. Drop the first b31 block at the center slot of the bottom layer (layer 0) using the ab_drop() function. This will provide a stable base for the rest of the structure.
3. Drop two b13 blocks, one on each side of the b31 block, on layer 1 to provide support for the upper part of the "E" shape.
4. Drop another b31 block above the first one, but shifted to the right by 2 slots. This will create the horizontal line of the "E".
5. Drop two more b13 blocks above the previous b13 blocks, aligned with the b31 blocks, on layer 2 to continue the vertical lines of the "E".
6. Drop a b31 block above the third b13 block, but shifted to the left by 2 slots. This will complete the horizontal line of the "E".
7. Finally, drop two more b13 blocks above the fourth b13 blocks, aligned with the b31 block, on layer 3 to complete the vertical lines of the "E".

The resulting structure will resemble the uppercase character "E" and meet all the hard constraints. Please note that the order and position of the block drops are crucial for stability and meeting the constraints.
