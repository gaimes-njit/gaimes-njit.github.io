To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "I" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping the b13 block at the center slot (y = W/2) using the ab_drop() function:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```
This will position the block in the middle and provide a stable base for the rest of the structure.

3. Next, drop four b11 blocks centered on top of the b13 block, forming the vertical stroke of the "I":
```python
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
```
These blocks will stack on top of each other and create a stable structure.

4. Lastly, drop the b31 block centered on top of the last b11 block, completing the horizontal stroke of the "I":
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

The final structure will meet all the hard constraints and resemble the uppercase character "I". To ensure stability, the ab_drop() function checks for support before each drop, preventing the structure from collapsing. The coordinates of each block drop are also provided.
