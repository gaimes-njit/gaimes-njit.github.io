To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "J" using the ab_drop() function, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b13 block to form the vertical part of the "J" shape. This block should be dropped in the middle slot (y = (W-1)//2) so that it aligns with the center of the structure.

```
ab_drop('b13', (W-1)//2)
```

3. Drop the b31 block to form the horizontal part of the "J" shape. This block should be dropped one layer above the base layer (H-2) and aligned with the bottom of the vertical block (y = (W-1)//2).

```
ab_drop('b31', (W-1)//2)
```

4. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure it remains stable and does not collapse. To do this, iterate over the layers from top to bottom, and for each layer and slot, check if the current structure or any previous structure already dropped below it provides support.

```
for i in range(H-1, -1, -1):
  for j in range(W):
    if structure[i][j] != ' ':
      is_supported = False
      if i < H-1 and structure[i+1][j] != ' ':
        is_supported = True
      if j > 0 and structure[i][j-1] != ' ':
        is_supported = True
      if j < W-1 and structure[i][j+1] != ' ':
        is_supported = True
  
      if not is_supported:
        print("Error: Structure is not stable")
        return
```

5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each subsequent layer until the top layer (H-1) is reached.

```
for i in range(H-3, -1, -1):
  ab_drop('b31', (W-1)//2)
```

6. Finally, check if the generated structure resembles the uppercase character "J". We can do this by comparing the structure with a reference template of the "J" shape.

```
reference_j = [
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', 'b31', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']
]

for i in range(H):
  for j in range(W):
    if structure[i][j] != reference_j[i][j]:
      print("Error: Structure does not resemble 'J'")
      return
```
7. If all checks pass, the generated structure is valid and resembles the uppercase character "J".
