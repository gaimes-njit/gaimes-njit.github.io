To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "L" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow the approach outlined below:

1. Determine the base of the structure by dropping a b31 block at the middle slot (y = W/2) using the ab_drop() function.
   - ab_drop(b31, W/2)

2. Add support to the base by dropping two b11 blocks on each side of the base at the same level as the center slot using the ab_drop() function.
   - ab_drop(b11, W/2-1)
   - ab_drop(b11, W/2+1)

3. Drop a b13 block on top of the base at the center slot using the ab_drop() function.
   - ab_drop(b13, W/2)

4. Add support to the b13 block by dropping two b11 blocks on each side at the same level as the center slot using the ab_drop() function.
   - ab_drop(b11, W/2-1)
   - ab_drop(b11, W/2+1)

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to build the vertical part of the "L" structure. Each time, increase the height of the b13 block by one layer and add support with two b11 blocks on each side.
   - ab_drop(b13, W/2)
   - ab_drop(b11, W/2-1)
   - ab_drop(b11, W/2+1)

6. To complete the horizontal part of the "L" structure, drop a b31 block on top of the vertical part using the ab_drop() function.
   - ab_drop(b31, W/2)

7. Add support to the upper part of the "L" structure by dropping two b11 blocks on each side of the b31 block at the same level as the center slot using the ab_drop() function.
   - ab_drop(b11, W/2-1)
   - ab_drop(b11, W/2+1)

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 until the desired height of the structure is reached, ensuring stability and adding support as necessary.

By following this approach and using the ab_drop() function, you can generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "L" and meets all the hard constraints.
