To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "M" and meets all the hard constraints, we need to strategically place the blocks in a way that ensures stability and resembles the desired shape. We will use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks into the structure.

Here is a step-by-step approach to generating the structure:

1. Start with an initialized empty structure:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. First, drop a b31 block in the center of the structure to form the center of the "M":
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Next, drop a b13 block on both sides of the center block to form the two outer vertical lines of the "M":
```
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
```

4. To complete the top part of the "M", drop a b11 block above each vertical line at the top:
```
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 12)
```

5. Now, we need to create the downward strokes of the "M" using b31 and b11 blocks. Drop a b31 block above the center block, but one slot to the left or right to maintain stability:
```
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

6. Drop a b11 block above each b31 block to complete the downward strokes of the "M":
```
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 13)
```

7. Finally, we need to ensure stability for the lower part of the "M". Drop a b31 block on top of each b11 block in the center line:
```
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
```

After following these steps, the `structure` will contain a stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "M". It is important to note that stability checks should be performed before each call to `ab_drop()` to ensure the entire structure remains stable throughout the generation process.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:
```python
W = 20
H = 16

def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
            
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    return drop_pos

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 13)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 13)
```

By following the above steps, you will generate a stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "M". Remember to perform stability checks before each call to `ab_drop()` to ensure the structure remains stable.
