To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "M" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a `drop()` function that checks for stability before calling the `ab_drop()` function. This function will iterate through the layers of the structure from bottom to top and check if a drop position is stable by verifying that the structure has support below it. If stability is not found, the function will return `False`, indicating that a stable drop position could not be found.

2. Define the main algorithm to build the structure. Start by initializing an empty 2D grid called `structure` with dimensions `W` x `H`. This grid will represent the structure being built.

3. Create a function called `build_m_structure()` that will be responsible for constructing the "M" structure. This function will first call the `drop()` function to find a stable drop position for the first block, which will be a `b31` block placed vertically. After dropping the block, update the `structure` grid accordingly.

4. Place the remaining blocks. To create the "M" shape, we will drop a `b13` block on top of each of the outer slots of the `b31` block, creating the two side columns. Finally, we will drop a `b31` block on top of the middle slot of the `b31` block, creating the middle column.

5. Implement the `drop()` function to check for stability. This function will iterate through the layers from bottom to top, and for each layer, it will check if the current slot has a block below it or is at the boundary of the structure. If a stable drop position is found, it will return `True`, indicating stability. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

6. Call the `build_m_structure()` function to generate the "M" structure. This function will handle the entire construction process by calling the `ab_drop()` function for each block type and updating the `structure` grid.

Here is a possible implementation of the algorithm:

```python
import random

# Constants
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Drop block vertically and update structure grid
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    
    # Return drop coordinates
    return drop_pos

def build_m_structure():
    # Drop the base b31 block
    stable = drop('b31', 9)
    if not stable:
        return False
    
    # Drop the outer b13 blocks
    drop('b13', 8)
    drop('b13', 10)
    
    # Drop the middle b31 block
    drop('b31', 9)
    
    return True

def drop(x, y):
    # Check stability for given block and slot position
    for layer in range(1, H):
        if structure[layer][y] != ' ' or (y == 0 and x == 'b31') or (y == W-1 and x == 'b31'):
            return True
    return False

def generate_structure():
    random.seed(0)  # Set seed for reproducibility
    success = build_m_structure()
    
    if success:
        print("Structure generated successfully:")
        for row in structure:
            print(''.join(row))
    else:
        print("Failed to generate the structure.")

generate_structure()
```

Please note that this is just one possible approach to generate the "M" structure and meet all the hard constraints. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints, the algorithm may need to be adjusted.
