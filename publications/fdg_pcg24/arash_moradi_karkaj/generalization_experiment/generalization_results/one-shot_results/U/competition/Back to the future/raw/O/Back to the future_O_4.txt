To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "O" and meets all the hard constraints using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
   ```
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. To meet the stability constraint, we need to ensure that each dropped block has proper support. We can start by dropping the blocks that provide the base support:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 9) # Drop a vertical block at slot 9
   ab_drop('b13', 10) # Drop a vertical block at slot 10
   ```

3. Next, we can start building the outer ring of the uppercase "O" shape using horizontal blocks (`b31`):
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 6) # Drop a horizontal block at slot 6
   ab_drop('b31', 7) # Drop a horizontal block at slot 7
   ab_drop('b31', 8) # Drop a horizontal block at slot 8
   ab_drop('b31', 11) # Drop a horizontal block at slot 11
   ab_drop('b31', 12) # Drop a horizontal block at slot 12
   ab_drop('b31', 13) # Drop a horizontal block at slot 13
   ```

4. Now, we can fill in the inside of the "O" shape using vertical blocks (`b13`):
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 7) # Drop a vertical block at slot 7
   ab_drop('b13', 12) # Drop a vertical block at slot 12
   ```

5. To satisfy the boundary intrusion constraint, we can drop additional blocks to fill the empty slots on the boundaries:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 0) # Drop a square block at the leftmost slot (slot 0)
   ab_drop('b11', 19) # Drop a square block at the rightmost slot (slot 19)
   ```

6. Finally, we can perform a stability check to ensure that the entire structure is stable before generation.
