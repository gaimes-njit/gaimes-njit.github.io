# Solution: Generating a Structure Resembling the Letter "G"

# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the initial blocks to form the base of the structure
ab_drop('b31',7)
ab_drop('b31',9)

# Drop blocks to form the middle section of the letter "G"
ab_drop('b13',6)
ab_drop('b13',13)
ab_drop('b31',10)

# Drop blocks to form the top section of the letter "G"
ab_drop('b13',7)
ab_drop('b13',9)
ab_drop('b13',11)

# Drop final blocks to complete the structure
ab_drop('b31',7)
ab_drop('b31',9)
ab_drop('b13',8)

# The resulting code uses the ab_drop() function to generate a stable structure that resembles the letter "G". The blocks are dropped in a specific order to ensure stability and proper weight distribution. The code does not contain any loops or recursion, as per the constraints.
