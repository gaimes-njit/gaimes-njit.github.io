The code to generate a stable structure that looks like the capital letter "U" can be achieved using a series of `ab_drop()` function calls. Here is the code:

# Initialize the structure
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop blocks to form the letter U
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)

This code will drop the blocks in the following sequence:
1. Drop a horizontal block ('b31') with the center at index 9. This forms the top of the letter U.
2. Drop a vertical block ('b13') with the center at index 8. This forms the left vertical line of the letter U.
3. Drop another vertical block ('b13') with the center at index 10. This forms the right vertical line of the letter U.

The resulting structure will resemble the capital letter "U".
