To form the letter "H" shape using the given bricks, we can break it down into two separate parts: the vertical line and the horizontal line.

First, we will generate the vertical line using the b13 brick. We will start by executing `ab_drop('b13', 7)` to place the b13 brick with an x_position of 7. This will occupy the cells (7, 0), (7, 1), and (7, 2).

Next, we will generate the horizontal line using the b31 brick. We will execute `ab_drop('b31', 3)` to place the b31 brick with an x_position of 3. This will occupy the cells (2, 3), (3, 3), and (4, 3).

Finally, we need to ensure stability and avoid boundary collisions. We can achieve stability by making sure that the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot (cell (3, 3)) are the same. In this case, we have one occupied cell on the left and one occupied cell on the right. 

To avoid boundary collisions, we need to make sure that the occupied cells of both bricks do not exceed the boundaries of the field, which is from (0, 0) to (19, 15). In this case, both bricks are within the boundaries and we have satisfied this condition.

The final structure representing the letter "H" will have the following occupied cells:

(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2) - Vertical line
(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3) - Horizontal line

Please note that the code to be executed should be written between the last 2 pairs of three backticks(```).
