To form a shape resembling the letter "J", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() function calls:

1. Place a b31 brick at x_position 9:
ab_drop('b31', 9)
This will occupy the cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).

2. Place a b13 brick at x_position 9:
ab_drop('b13', 9)
This will occupy the cells (9, 1), (9, 0), and (9, 2).

3. Place a b11 brick at x_position 8:
ab_drop('b11', 8)
This will occupy the cell (8, 3).

By following this sequence, we have formed a shape resembling the letter "J" while satisfying the stability and boundary collision conditions.
