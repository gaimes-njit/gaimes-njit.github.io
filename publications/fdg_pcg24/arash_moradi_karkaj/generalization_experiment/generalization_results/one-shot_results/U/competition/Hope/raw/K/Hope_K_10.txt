To create a "K" structure inside a 20*16 box using ab_drop function, we can follow these steps:

1. Place the first vertical line of the "K" using a 3*1 block at position (0,0).
ab_drop('b31', 0)

2. Place the horizontal line of the "K" using a 1*3 block starting from position (2,0).
ab_drop('b13', 2)

3. Place the second vertical line of the "K" using a 3*1 block at position (5,0).
ab_drop('b31', 5)

Note: The numbering in x position starts from 0, so we increment the x position based on the previous block's width.

This will create a structure exactly like the letter "K" inside a 20*16 box.
