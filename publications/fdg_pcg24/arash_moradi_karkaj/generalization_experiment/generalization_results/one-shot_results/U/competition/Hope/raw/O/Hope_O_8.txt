To create the structure "O" inside a 20*16 box, you would need to use the ab_drop() function to drop blocks at specific x positions. Here is the sequence of commands:

1. Drop a 3*1 block at x=2:
ab_drop('b31', 2)

2. Drop a 1*3 block at x=2:
ab_drop('b13', 2)

3. Drop a 3*1 block at x=18:
ab_drop('b31', 18)

4. Drop a 1*3 block at x=18:
ab_drop('b13', 18)

This will create an "O" shape inside the box.
