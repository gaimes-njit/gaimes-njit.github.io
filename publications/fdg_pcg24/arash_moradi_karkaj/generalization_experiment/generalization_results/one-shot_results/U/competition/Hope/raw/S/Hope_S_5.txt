First, we need to determine the positions where each block will be dropped.

To create the "S" structure, we can start by dropping a b31 block at position (0, 0). This will be the top-left corner of the "S".

Next, we drop a b13 block at position (2, 1). This will be the middle part of the "S".

Finally, we drop another b31 block at position (5, 2). This will be the bottom-right part of the "S".

Here is the code to create the "S" structure using the ab_drop function:

ab_drop('b31', 0)     # drop a b31 block at position (0, 0)
ab_drop('b13', 2)     # drop a b13 block at position (2, 1)
ab_drop('b31', 5)     # drop a b31 block at position (5, 2)
