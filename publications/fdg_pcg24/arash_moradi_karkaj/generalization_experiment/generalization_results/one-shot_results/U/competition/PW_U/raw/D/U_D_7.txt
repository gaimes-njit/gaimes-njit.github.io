To generate the uppercase letter "D", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

This will create the shape of the letter "D" in the grid using the provided block types. The blocks are placed consecutively from left to right, starting from the X position 1, while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
