To generate the uppercase letter "F" using the given block types and environment, you can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. Start by dropping a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. This forms the top part of the letter "F".
2. Drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1. This forms the left vertical stroke of the letter "F".
3. Drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position 2. This forms the right vertical stroke of the letter "F".
4. Finally, drop a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 2 to complete the bottom part of the letter "F".

By following these commands, you will construct the letter "F" in the Tetris-like environment while ensuring stability and fitting within the allowed space boundaries.
