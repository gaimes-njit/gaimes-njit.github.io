To generate the uppercase English letter "F", we need to stack the blocks in a specific way. Below is the sequence of ab_drop() commands that will generate the letter "F":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b11',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b11',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
```

These commands will place the blocks in the correct order and position to form the letter "F" within the allowed space boundaries.
