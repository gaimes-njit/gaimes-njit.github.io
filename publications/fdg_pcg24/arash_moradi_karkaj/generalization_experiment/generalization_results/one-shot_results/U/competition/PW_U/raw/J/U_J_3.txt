To generate the uppercase letter "J", we can use a combination of block types b31 and b13. Here's the stream of commands to construct the letter "J":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first two commands `ab_drop('b31', 1)` place two horizontal straight blocks next to each other, creating the top part of the letter "J".
- The next three commands `ab_drop('b13', 2)` place three vertical straight blocks one below the other, creating the vertical line of the letter "J".
