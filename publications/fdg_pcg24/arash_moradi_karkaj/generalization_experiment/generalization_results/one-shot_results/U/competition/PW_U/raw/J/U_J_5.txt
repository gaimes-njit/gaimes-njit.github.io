To generate the uppercase letter "J" using the given block types and environment:

```
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop('b31',2)` places a horizontal straight block (b31) with a width of 3 units at position 2 along the width. This forms the top horizontal part of the letter "J".
- The second command `ab_drop('b13',1)` places a vertical straight block (b13) with a height of 3 units at position 1 along the width. This forms the long vertical part of the letter "J".
- The third command `ab_drop('b13',3)` places another vertical straight block (b13) with a height of 3 units at position 3 along the width. This completes the long vertical part of the letter "J".
- The fourth, fifth, and sixth commands repeat the placement of vertical straight blocks at positions 1, 2, and 3 to make the vertical part of the letter "J" more stable and solid.
