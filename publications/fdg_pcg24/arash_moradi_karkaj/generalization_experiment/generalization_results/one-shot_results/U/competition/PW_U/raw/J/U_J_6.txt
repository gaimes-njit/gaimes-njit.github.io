To generate the uppercase letter "J" using the given block types and gravity rules, you can follow these steps:

```python
ab_drop('b13',1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13',2)   # Place another vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31',3)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b11',3)   # Place a square block on top of the horizontal straight block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "J" within the allowed space boundaries.
