To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This series of commands will place the blocks in the Tetris-like environment to form the shape of the letter "J".
