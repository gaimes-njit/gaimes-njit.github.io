To generate the uppercase letter "K" in the given environment, we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical block (b13) at position 1.
3. Place a single block (b11) at position 2.
4. Place a vertical block (b13) at position 2.
5. Place another vertical block (b13) at position 3.

These commands will create the uppercase letter "K" in the Tetris-like environment, following the gravity rules and within the specified boundaries.
