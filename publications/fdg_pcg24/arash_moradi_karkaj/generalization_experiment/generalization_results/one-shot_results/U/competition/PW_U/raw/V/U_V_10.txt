To generate the uppercase letter "V", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

This will create a vertical straight block on the left side of the grid, followed by another vertical straight block on the right side, and finally a horizontal straight block in the middle, forming the letter "V" shape.
