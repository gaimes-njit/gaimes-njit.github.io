To generate the uppercase letter "V" using the given block types and rules, you can follow these commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

This sequence of commands will first create two vertical straight blocks ('b31') horizontally aligned at positions 1 and 3. Then, a horizontal straight block ('b13') will be placed in the middle (position 2) to complete the "V" shape.
