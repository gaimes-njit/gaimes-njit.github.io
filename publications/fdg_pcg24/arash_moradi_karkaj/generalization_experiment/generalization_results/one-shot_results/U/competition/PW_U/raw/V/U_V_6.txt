To generate the uppercase English letter "V", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2 and 4 along the width. This forms the two sides of the letter "V".
- Then, we place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1 and 5 along the width. This forms the connecting bottom part of the letter "V".
- Finally, we place a square block ('b11') at position 3 along the width. This forms the tip of the letter "V".

The resulting formation resembles the uppercase English letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries.
