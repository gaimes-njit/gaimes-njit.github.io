To create the uppercase English letter "V", we can use the following commands:

``` 
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',3)
```

These commands will place the blocks in a way that creates a "V" shape, starting from the X position 1 and using the specified block types. The vertical blocks are placed first, followed by the horizontal block to form the letter "V".
