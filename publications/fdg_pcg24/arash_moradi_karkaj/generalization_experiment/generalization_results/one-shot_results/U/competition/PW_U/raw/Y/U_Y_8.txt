To generate the uppercase English letter "Y", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This sequence places the blocks in the correct positions to form the letter "Y" within the allowed space boundaries.
