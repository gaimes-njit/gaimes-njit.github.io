To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "B" using the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the bottom of the "B" structure. In this case, we can use a b31 block as the base and place it on layer 0.
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 3: Place the left vertical part of the "B" structure. We can use a b13 block and place it on the left side of the base block, on the same layer.
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

Step 4: Place the top horizontal part of the "B" structure. Again, we can use a b31 block and place it above the base block, ensuring it is aligned with the left vertical part.
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 5: Place the right vertical part of the "B" structure. Use a b13 block and place it on the right side of the base block, aligned with the left vertical part.
```
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

After executing these steps, the structure generated will resemble the character "B" and will meet all the stated hard constraints of stability and boundary intrusion.

Please note that the specific slot and slot order chosen for each block placement can vary based on the technique used and the desired result. The example provided is one possible solution, but you can experiment with different placements to achieve alternative stable structures resembling the character "B".
