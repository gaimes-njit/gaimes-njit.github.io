To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "C" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b31 block first to create the base of the structure. To meet stability rule 1, we need to ensure that the b31 block is placed on a solid base. We can achieve this by dropping a b11 block first, followed by the b31 block. We can choose the appropriate slots to align the blocks using the ab_drop() function.

```python
ab_drop("b11", 8)  # Drop b11 block at slot 8
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Drop b31 block at slot 9
```

3. Next, drop the b13 block to complete the vertical part of the structure. To meet stability rule 1, we need to drop the b13 block on top of the b31 block. We can choose the appropriate slot using the ab_drop() function.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Drop b13 block at slot 9
```

4. Finally, drop the b31 block again, but this time at a higher position to complete the horizontal part of the structure. We can choose the appropriate slot using the ab_drop() function.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 6)  # Drop b31 block at slot 6
```

5. The resulting structure should resemble the character "C" and satisfy all hard constraints. You can display the structure to verify the result.

```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The above code will generate a new structure that meets all the given requirements and resembles the character "C". Remember to adjust the slot positions and order based on the desired shape and stability constraints.
