To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "J" using the ab_drop() function, we need to carefully consider the constraints and the shape of the structure.

First, let's address the stability constraint. According to the stability rules:
1) A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
2) Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
3) Structure should not be separated.

Based on these rules, we can determine that the base of the structure should be a b11 block. We will place it at the bottom layer, centered at slot 9 (W/2 = 20/2 = 10), as it provides a stable foundation for the rest of the structure.

Next, we can proceed with the shape of the structure. The character "J" consists of a b31 block stacked on top of a b13 block. We will place the b13 block on top of the b11 block, centered at slot 9, and drop it using the ab_drop() function. Then, we will place the b31 block on top of the b13 block, also centered at slot 9, and drop it using the ab_drop() function.

Here is the code to generate the desired structure:

``` python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop b11 block at the base
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Drop b13 block on top of b11 block
ab_drop('b13', 9)

# Drop b31 block on top of b13 block
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "J" and meets all the hard constraints.
