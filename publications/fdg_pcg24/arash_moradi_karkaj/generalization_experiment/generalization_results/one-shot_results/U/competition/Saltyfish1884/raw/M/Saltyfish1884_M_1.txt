To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base of the structure using b11 blocks on layer 0:
```
for i in range(6, 15):
    ab_drop('b11', i)
```

3. Place the side legs of the "M" shape using b31 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 15)
```

4. Place the middle part of the "M" shape using b13 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

5. Place the top part of the "M" shape using b11 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```

6. Place additional b11 blocks to connect the side legs with the middle and top parts:
```
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 15)
```

After executing these steps, the structure variable will contain the stable structure that resembles the character "M" and meets all the hard constraints.

Note: The specific order and position of the blocks may vary as long as the resulting structure is stable and satisfies all the constraints.
