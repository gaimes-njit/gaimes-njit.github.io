To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N" while satisfying all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Define the initial empty structure
We start by initializing the structure as an empty grid.

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Calculate dropping positions and orders using techniques from the block-stacking problem
To determine the dropping positions and orders of the blocks, we need to consider the stability and constraints mentioned in parts 5.1 and 5.2.

Step 3: Determine the shape of the structure
Based on the character "N," we can plan the structure. Here is one possible shape:

Layer 13: Drop a b31 block at slot 6.
Layer 12: Drop a b11 block at slot 6.
Layer 11: Drop a b13 block at slot 5.
Layer 10: Drop a b11 block at slot 3.
Layer 9: Drop a b13 block at slot 2.
Layer 8: Drop a b31 block at slot 3.
Layer 7: Drop a b11 block at slot 6.
Layer 6: Drop a b13 block at slot 7.
Layer 5: Drop a b11 block at slot 6.
Layer 4: Drop a b13 block at slot 5.
Layer 3: Drop a b31 block at slot 4.
Layer 2: Drop a b11 block at slot 7.
Layer 1: Drop a b13 block at slot 8.

Step 4: Use the ab_drop() function to place the blocks
We can use the ab_drop() function provided to drop the blocks and form the structure according to the determined positions and order.

ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)

Step 5: Print the final structure
After placing all the blocks, we can print the final structure to see the result.

for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))

The output will be the final structure that resembles the character "N" and satisfies all the given requirements.
