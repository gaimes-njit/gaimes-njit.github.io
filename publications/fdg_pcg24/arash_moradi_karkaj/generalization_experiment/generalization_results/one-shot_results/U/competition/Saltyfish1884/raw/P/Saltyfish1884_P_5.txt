To generate a structure that resembles the character "P" and meets all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b13 block (vertical block) on the left side of the structure to form the vertical stroke of the "P". Use the ab_drop() function to drop the block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the b13 block at slot 1
```

3. Place a b31 block (horizontal block) on top of the b13 block to form the top part of the "P". Use the ab_drop() function to drop the block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the b31 block at slot 1
```

4. Place a b11 block (square block) on top of the b31 block to complete the main structure of the "P". Use the ab_drop() function to drop the block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Place the b11 block at slot 1
```

5. To meet the stability constraint, make sure that the structure is stable. In this case, the structure is already stable because the b31 block is placed on top of the b13 block which serves as a solid base.

6. To meet the no boundary intrusion constraint, ensure that the blocks do not intrude on the map's boundary. In this case, the structure does not intrude on the boundary.

After following these steps, the final structure will resemble the character "P" and meet all the given constraints.
