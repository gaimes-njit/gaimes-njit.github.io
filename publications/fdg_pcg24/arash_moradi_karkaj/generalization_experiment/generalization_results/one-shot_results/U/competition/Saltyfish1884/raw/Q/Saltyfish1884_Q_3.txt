To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q", we can approach it as follows:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the given code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base of the structure by dropping a b11 block at a suitable slot. This will act as the foundation for the rest of the structure.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop a b11 block at slot 9
```

3. Add the upper part of the "Q" shape by dropping a b31 block on top of the base. The b31 block should be placed on a solid base to prevent overhangs.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop a b31 block at slot 9
```

4. Place the tail of the "Q" shape by dropping a b13 block next to the b31 block. This will complete the shape.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 12)  # Drop a b13 block at slot 12
```

5. Ensure that all stability rules are met, such as placing blocks as low as possible and ensuring the structure is not separated.

```python
# Check for stability and adjust the placement of blocks if necessary
# Perform additional ab_drop() calls as needed
```

6. Finally, print the structure to see the resulting "Q" shape.

```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This step-by-step approach ensures that a stable structure resembling the character "Q" is generated while meeting all the given constraints. Keep in mind that additional adjustments may be required to fine-tune the placement of blocks for optimal stability.
