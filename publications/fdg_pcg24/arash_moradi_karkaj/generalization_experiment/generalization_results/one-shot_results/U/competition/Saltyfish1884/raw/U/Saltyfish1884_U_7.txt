To generate a structure that resembles the character "U" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the base blocks (b11 or b13) at the bottom of the structure to provide a stable foundation:
```
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```

3. Drop a b31 block on top of the base blocks to form the horizontal part of the "U" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

4. Drop two b13 blocks on top of the b31 block to form the vertical parts of the "U" shape:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

5. Drop another b31 block on top of the vertical blocks to form the top of the "U" shape:
```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

6. The resulting structure will resemble the character "U" and meet all the hard constraints. Print the structure to see the final result:
```
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Note: The specific slot and layer numbers used in the ab_drop() function calls may need to be adjusted based on the desired positioning of the "U" shape within the structure.
