To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Z" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the b11 blocks to form the horizontal base.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Step 3: Drop the b31 block on top of the base.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

Step 4: Drop the b13 block next to the b31 block.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Step 5: Drop the second b31 block on top of the base, but shifted by one slot to the right.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

Step 6: Drop the second b13 block next to the second b31 block, but shifted by one slot to the right.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

Step 7: The resulting structure should resemble the character "Z" and meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is the final code:
```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop b11 blocks for the horizontal base
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Drop b31 block on top of the base
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Drop b13 block next to the b31 block
ab_drop('b13', 3)

# Drop the second b31 block on top of the base, but shifted by one slot to the right
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Drop the second b13 block next to the second b31 block, but shifted by one slot to the right
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

The resulting structure should resemble the character "Z" and meet all the given requirements.
