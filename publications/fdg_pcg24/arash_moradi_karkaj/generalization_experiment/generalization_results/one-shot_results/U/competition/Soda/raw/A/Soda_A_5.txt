To create the letter "A" in the level, we can use a combination of column and row blocks. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the first column block at the center of the level: (x_position = 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)

2. Drop the second column block slightly to the left of the first block: (x_position = 7)
ab_drop("b13", 7)

3. Drop the row block on top of the two column blocks: (x_position = 8)
ab_drop("b31", 8)

4. Drop the row block above the first column block: (x_position = 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

5. Drop the row block above the second column block: (x_position = 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will create a structure that resembles the letter "A".
