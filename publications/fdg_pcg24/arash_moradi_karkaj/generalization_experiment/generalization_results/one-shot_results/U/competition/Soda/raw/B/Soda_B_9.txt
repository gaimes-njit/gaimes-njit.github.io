To generate a structure in the level that looks like the letter "B", we can break it down into two blocks: a vertical pipe and two horizontal bars. We will start by dropping the vertical pipe.

1. Drop the vertical pipe:
We will use the block type "b13" to create a vertical pipe. We will drop it at the center position of the leftmost column (x_position = 0).

```python
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

2. Drop the top horizontal bar:
We will use the block type "b31" to create the top horizontal bar. We will drop it at the center position of the second column (x_position = 1).

```python
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

3. Drop the bottom horizontal bar:
We will use the block type "b31" to create the bottom horizontal bar. We will drop it at the center position of the second column (x_position = 1).

```python
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

This implementation will create a structure that looks like the letter "B" when viewed from the top.
