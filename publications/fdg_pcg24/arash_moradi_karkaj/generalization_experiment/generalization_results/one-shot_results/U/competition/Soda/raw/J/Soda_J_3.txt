To create the letter "J" in the level, we need to drop three blocks in a specific order. 

The first block is a vertical column block "b13". We will drop this block in the center of the grid.

The second block is a horizontal row block "b31". We will drop this block so that it is positioned just above the top of the vertical column block.

The third block is another vertical column block "b13" that is rotated 180 degrees. We will drop this block so that it is positioned just above the horizontal row block.

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b13", 9)  
ab_drop("b31", 9)  
ab_drop("b13", 9)
