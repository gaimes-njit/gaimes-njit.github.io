To generate a structure that looks like the letter "K", we can break it down into three parts: two vertical bars and one diagonal bar. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. Drop the first vertical bar:
   - ab_drop("b31", 4)

2. Drop the second vertical bar:
   - ab_drop("b31", 7)

3. Drop the diagonal bar:
   - ab_drop("b13", 6)

Complete implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```
