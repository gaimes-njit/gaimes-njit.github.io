To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "O", we can start by placing a square block in the center of the grid. This will serve as the base of our structure.

Next, we can place two column blocks on top of the square block, aligned with its sides. This will create the top and bottom "extensions" of the letter "O".

Finally, we can place two row blocks on either side of the square block, aligned with its top and bottom. This will create the left and right "extensions" of the letter "O".

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Place the square block at the center of the grid
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# Place the top and bottom column blocks
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)

# Place the left and right row blocks
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation ensures that the structure is stable and resembles the letter "O".
