To create the capital letter "Q" in the level, we need to build it using blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion. We will start by building the base of the letter and then add the upper part.

Step 1: Build the base of the letter "Q"
To build the base of the letter "Q", we will start from the bottom-left corner and build towards the right side. We will use a row block (b31) with its center pivot at the leftmost column of the grid. We will also use a square block (b11) to fill the first cell of the row block.

ab_drop("b31", 0)  # drop the row block with pivot at the leftmost column
ab_drop("b11", 0)  # drop the square block to fill the first cell of the row block

Next, to complete the base of the letter "Q", we will add another row block (b31) to the right of the existing row block. We will use a square block (b11) to fill the first cell of this row block as well.

ab_drop("b31", 2)  # drop the row block with pivot at the third column
ab_drop("b11", 2)  # drop the square block to fill the first cell of the row block

Step 2: Build the upper part of the letter "Q"
To build the upper part of the letter "Q", we will start from the top-right corner of the base and build towards the left side. We will use a column block (b13) with its center pivot at the rightmost cell of the grid.

ab_drop("b13", 19)  # drop the column block with pivot at the rightmost column

Finally, to complete the letter "Q", we will add a square block (b11) above the column block to fill the top-right cell of the grid.

ab_drop("b11", 19)  # drop the square block to fill the top-right cell

Complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b11", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 19)
ab_drop("b11", 19)
