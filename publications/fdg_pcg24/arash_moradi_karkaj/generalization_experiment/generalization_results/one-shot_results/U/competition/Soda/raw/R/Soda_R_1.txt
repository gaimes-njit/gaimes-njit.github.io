To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "R" in the game of Tetris, we can break it down into three separate blocks: a column block, a row block, and another column block. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the first column block (b13) at the leftmost position (x_position = 0). This will form the left side of the letter "R".
```python
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

Step 2: Place the row block (b31) right above the column block. This will form the middle part of the letter "R".
```python
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Step 3: Place the second column block (b13) right next to the row block. This will form the right side of the letter "R".
```python
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

The complete implementation:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

This implementation ensures the stability of the structure and creates a structure that looks like the capital letter "R".
