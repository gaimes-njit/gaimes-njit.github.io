To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "R", we will need to use the ab_drop() function to drop and position blocks in the level. We will start by creating the base of the letter "R" and then add the vertical pillar and the diagonal line.

Here is the step-by-step implementation to create the letter "R":

1. Place the base of the letter "R" using a row block ("b31") at position x=7.
ab_drop("b31", 7)

2. Place the vertical pillar of the letter "R" using a column block ("b13") at position x=9.
ab_drop("b13", 9)

3. Place the diagonal line of the letter "R" using a row block ("b31") at position x=12.
ab_drop("b31", 12)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```
