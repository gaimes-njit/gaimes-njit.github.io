To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "S", we can first create the base of the letter, which consists of three blocks arranged horizontally. We will use the "b31" block type for this.

Then, we can add the upper part of the letter "S" by stacking two "b13" blocks vertically on top of each other, slightly shifted to the right.

Finally, we can add the middle part of the letter "S" by placing a single "b11" block above the gap between the upper and lower parts.

Here is the complete implementation to generate the letter "S" structure:

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)   # Create the base of the letter "S"
ab_drop("b13", 5)   # Add the upper part of the letter "S"
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 4)   # Add the middle part of the letter "S"
```

This implementation ensures stability by creating a balanced structure and enforces the best similarity by matching the shape of the letter "S".
