To generate a structure in the shape of the capital "W", we can break it down into three separate blocks - two column blocks and one row block. We will start building the structure from the bottom and work our way up.

First, we will place the two column blocks at the bottom corners of the grid. These blocks will form the outer edges of the "W".

```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 18)
```

Next, we will place the row block above the two column blocks, in the center of the grid. This block will form the middle section of the "W".

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Finally, we will place another row block above the first one, but slightly offset to the left. This block will complete the top section of the "W".

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

The complete implementation, without any errors, is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 18)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```
