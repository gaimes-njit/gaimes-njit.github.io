To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "R" using the `ab_drop()` function, we will need to carefully drop the blocks in a specific order and position. The following steps outline the process:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code.
2. Drop a `b31` block at slot 2 using the `ab_drop('b31', 2)` function.
3. Drop a `b13` block at slot 1 using the `ab_drop('b13', 1)` function.
4. Drop a `b11` block at slot 0 using the `ab_drop('b11', 0)` function.
5. Drop a `b13` block at slot 1 using the `ab_drop('b13', 1)` function.
6. Drop a `b13` block at slot 2 using the `ab_drop('b13', 2)` function.
7. Drop a `b11` block at slot 0 using the `ab_drop('b11', 0)` function.
8. Drop a `b11` block at slot 2 using the `ab_drop('b11', 2)` function.

After following these steps, the structure will resemble the character "R" and meet the stability constraint.
