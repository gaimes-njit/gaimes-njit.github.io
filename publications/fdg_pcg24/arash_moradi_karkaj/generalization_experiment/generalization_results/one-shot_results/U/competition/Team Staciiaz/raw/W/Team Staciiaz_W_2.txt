To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" using the `ab_drop()` function while satisfying all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define the block types and their shapes:
```
block_shapes = {
    'b11': [(0, 0)],
    'b31': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)],
    'b13': [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (-2, 0)]
}
```

3. First, drop the two side legs of the "W":
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Left leg
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Right leg
```

4. Drop the middle part of the "W":
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

The final structure should resemble the character "W" and satisfy all the constraints. Make sure to adjust the slot numbers according to the desired position of the "W" structure.
