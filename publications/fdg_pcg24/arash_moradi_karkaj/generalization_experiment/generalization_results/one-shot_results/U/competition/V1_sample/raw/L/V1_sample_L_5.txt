To generate a stable structure that looks like the "L," we can follow these steps using the ab drop() function:

1. Start by dropping a b11 block at position (y=5, H=15).
2. Then drop a b13 block centered at position (y=5, H=13).
3. Next, drop a b13 block centered at position (y=5, H=10).
4. Finally, drop a b31 block centered at position (y=3, H=7) to complete the "L" shape.

By following these steps and carefully positioning each block, you can create a stable structure that resembles the "L" shape using the ab drop() function.
