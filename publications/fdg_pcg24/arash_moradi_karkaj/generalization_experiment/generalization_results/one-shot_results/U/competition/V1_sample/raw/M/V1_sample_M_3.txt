To create the "M" structure using the `ab drop()` function, follow these steps:

1. First, drop a b13 block centered at slot 5 from layer 15:
```ab drop('b13', 5, 15)```

2. Next, drop a b13 block centered at slot 6 from layer 14:
```ab drop('b13', 6, 14)```

3. After that, drop a b13 block centered at slot 7 from layer 13:
```ab drop('b13', 7, 13)```

4. Now, drop a b31 block centered at slot 6 from layer 13:
```ab drop('b31', 6, 13)```

5. Drop another b13 block centered at slot 8 from layer 13:
```ab drop('b13', 8, 13)```

6. Lastly, drop a b13 block centered at slot 9 from layer 14:
```ab drop('b13', 9, 14)```

By following these steps, you should be able to create a stable structure that resembles the letter "M" using the `ab drop()` function. Adjust the slot positions and block types as needed to achieve the desired result.
