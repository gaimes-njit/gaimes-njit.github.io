To generate a stable structure that looks like the letter "M", you can use the following steps:

1. Drop a b31 block from layer 15 with its center at slot 6.
2. Drop a b13 block from layer 14 with its center at slot 6.
3. Drop a b13 block from layer 13 with its center at slot 5.
4. Drop a b13 block from layer 12 with its center at slot 4.
5. Drop a b13 block from layer 11 with its center at slot 3.
6. Drop a b13 block from layer 10 with its center at slot 2.
7. Drop a b13 block from layer 9 with its center at slot 1.
8. Drop a b11 block from layer 8 with its center at slot 1.
9. Drop a b11 block from layer 8 with its center at slot 7.
10. Drop a b13 block from layer 7 with its center at slot 3.
11. Drop a b13 block from layer 6 with its center at slot 4.
12. Drop a b13 block from layer 5 with its center at slot 5.
13. Drop a b13 block from layer 4 with its center at slot 6.
14. Drop a b13 block from layer 3 with its center at slot 7.
15. Drop a b31 block from layer 2 with its center at slot 7.

Following these steps will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "M" using the ‘ab drop()’ function.
