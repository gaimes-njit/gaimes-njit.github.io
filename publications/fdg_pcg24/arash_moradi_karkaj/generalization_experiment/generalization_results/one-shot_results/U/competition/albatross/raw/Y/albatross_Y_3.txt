The following code sequence can be used to construct a level for Science Birds that resembles the English letter "Y":

ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 12)

Explanation:
- First, we drop a vertical block (b13) in the middle slot (y=9) to form the central stem of the "Y".
- Then, we drop a horizontal block (b31) in the same slot (y=9) to create the top part of the "Y".
- Next, we drop four individual blocks (b11) on both sides of the stem to complete the top portion of the "Y".
- Finally, we drop two more individual blocks (b11) on the outside of the top part to extend the arms of the "Y".

By following this sequence, the resulting structure will resemble the letter "Y" and satisfy all the constraints of the Science Birds game while maintaining stability under gravity.
