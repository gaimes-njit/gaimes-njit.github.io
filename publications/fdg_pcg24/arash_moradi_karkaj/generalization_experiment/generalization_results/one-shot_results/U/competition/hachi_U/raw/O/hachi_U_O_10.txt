Example Solution:

The capital letter "O" can be constructed as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

This solution creates a stable structure resembling the letter "O" by strategically placing the blocks in a circular pattern. The blocks are placed in a way that ensures stability and avoids any boundary intrusion.
