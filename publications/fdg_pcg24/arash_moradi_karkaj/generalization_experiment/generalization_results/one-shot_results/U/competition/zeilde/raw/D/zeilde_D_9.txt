1. To draw the letter "D" with asterisks:

```
****
*   *
*   *
*   *
****
```

2. Line-by-line, verbally listing the asterisks and spaces generated in each row of the drawing:

Row 1: 4 asterisks
Row 2: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 3: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 4: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 5: 4 asterisks

3. Replacing asterisks with "x" and spaces with "y":

Row 1: 4x
Row 2: 1x, 3y, 1x
Row 3: 1x, 3y, 1x
Row 4: 1x, 3y, 1x
Row 5: 4x

4. Writing out each x and y for each row:

Row 1: xxxxx
Row 2: xyxyx
Row 3: xyxyx
Row 4: xyxyx
Row 5: xxxxx

5. Indicating the position of each variable:

Row 1: x-1, x-2, x-3, x-4, x-5
Row 2: x-1, y-2, x-3, y-4, x-5
Row 3: x-1, y-2, x-3, y-4, x-5
Row 4: x-1, y-2, x-3, y-4, x-5
Row 5: x-1, x-2, x-3, x-4, x-5

6. Returning a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

As a result, you would draw the letter "D" with asterisks and indicate the position of each asterisk and space, and you would also generate the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to recreate the visual representation of the letter "D".
