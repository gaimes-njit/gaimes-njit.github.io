1. The letter "E" made with asterisks would look like this:
```
*****
*
*****
*
*****
```
2. Line-by-line, the asterisks and spaces generated in each row of the drawing would be:
```
Row 1: 5 asterisks
Row 2: 1 asterisk
Row 3: 5 asterisks
Row 4: 1 asterisk
Row 5: 5 asterisks
```
3. Replacing asterisks with "x" and spaces with "y", we have:
```
Row 1: xxxxx
Row 2: x
Row 3: xxxxx
Row 4: x
Row 5: xxxxx
```
4. For each row, writing out each x and y side-by-side, we have:
```
Row 1: xxxxx
Row 2: x
Row 3: xxxxx
Row 4: x
Row 5: xxxxx
```
5. The positions of each variable in each row are:
```
Row 1: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
Row 2: x-1
Row 3: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
Row 4: x-1
Row 5: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
```
6. The sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row would be:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1) ab_drop("b11", 2) ab_drop("b11", 3) ab_drop("b11", 4) ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1) ab_drop("b11", 2) ab_drop("b11", 3) ab_drop("b11", 4) ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1) ab_drop("b11", 2) ab_drop("b11", 3) ab_drop("b11", 4) ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
