Here is the solution to create the structure resembling "G" while satisfying all the given constraints:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Dropping the horizontal block at the base
ab_drop('b31', 4)

# Dropping the vertical block below the horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 4)

# Dropping the horizontal block on top of the vertical block
ab_drop('b31', 4)

# Dropping the horizontal block above the first horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Dropping the vertical block to complete the curve of "G"
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` inputs will create a stable structure resembling the letter "G" while satisfying all the given constraints.
