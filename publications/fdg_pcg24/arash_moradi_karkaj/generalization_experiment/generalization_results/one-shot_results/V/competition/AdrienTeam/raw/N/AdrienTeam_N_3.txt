Here is an example solution that generates the structure resembling "N" while satisfying the given constraints:

```python
# Map Initialization
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the first block vertically to create the base
ab_drop('b13', 4)

# Drop the second block vertically to create the vertical line of the "N"
ab_drop('b13', 4)

# Drop the third block vertically to create the horizontal line of the "N"
ab_drop('b31', 4)

# Drop the fourth block vertically to complete the horizontal line of the "N"
ab_drop('b31', 4)

# Output the ab_drop() calls
print("ab_drop('b13', 4)")
print("ab_drop('b13', 4)")
print("ab_drop('b31', 4)")
print("ab_drop('b31', 4)")
```

This solution starts by creating the base of the "N" using two vertical blocks (`'b13'`) dropped on slot 4. Then, it adds the horizontal line of the "N" using two horizontal blocks (`'b31'`) dropped on slot 4. The resulting structure will resemble the letter "N" within the 20x16 grid.
