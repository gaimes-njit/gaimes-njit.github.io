To construct the structure resembling "R" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully plan the order and position at which the blocks are dropped. Here is the code to achieve this:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the map
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Step 2: Drop the blocks to construct "R"
# Drop the first block (b31) in the middle of the map
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the second block (b13) above the first block, slightly to the left
ab_drop('b13', 8)

# Drop the third block (b11) above the first block, slightly to the right
ab_drop('b11', 11)

# Drop the fourth block (b11) above the second block, slightly to the left
ab_drop('b11', 7)

# Drop the fifth block (b11) above the third block, slightly to the right
ab_drop('b11', 12)

# Drop the sixth block (b11) above the fourth block, slightly to the left
ab_drop('b11', 6)

# Drop the seventh block (b11) above the fifth block, slightly to the right
ab_drop('b11', 13)

# Drop the eighth block (b11) above the sixth block, slightly to the left
ab_drop('b11', 5)

# Drop the ninth block (b11) above the seventh block, slightly to the right
ab_drop('b11', 14)

# Drop the tenth block (b11) above the eighth block, slightly to the left
ab_drop('b11', 4)

# Drop the eleventh block (b11) above the ninth block, slightly to the right
ab_drop('b11', 15)

# Drop the twelfth block (b11) above the tenth block, slightly to the left
ab_drop('b11', 3)

# Drop the thirteenth block (b11) above the eleventh block, slightly to the right
ab_drop('b11', 16)

# Drop the fourteenth block (b11) above the twelfth block, slightly to the left
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Drop the fifteenth block (b11) above the thirteenth block, slightly to the right
ab_drop('b11', 17)

# Drop the sixteenth block (b11) above the fourteenth block, slightly to the left
ab_drop('b11', 1)

# Drop the seventeenth block (b11) above the fifteenth block, slightly to the right
ab_drop('b11', 18)

# Drop the eighteenth block (b11) above the sixteenth block, slightly to the left
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Drop the nineteenth block (b11) above the seventeenth block, slightly to the right
ab_drop('b11', 19)

# Step 3: Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This code will initialize a map, drop the blocks in the specified order and positions to form the structure "R", and finally print the resulting structure. Adjust the slots (y-coordinates) as needed to ensure that the blocks align properly to resemble the letter "R".
