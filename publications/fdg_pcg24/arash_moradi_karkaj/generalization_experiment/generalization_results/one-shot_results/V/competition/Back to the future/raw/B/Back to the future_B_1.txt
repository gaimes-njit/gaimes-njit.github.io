To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "B" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the hard constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the vertical block b13 at slot 3 to form the left side of the "B":
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (15, 3).

3. Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 4, aligning it with the top of the previously dropped vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (14, 4).

4. Drop the vertical block b13 at slot 5, aligning it with the bottom of the previously dropped horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (13, 5).

5. Drop another vertical block b13 at slot 5, aligning it with the top of the previously dropped vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (12, 5).

6. Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 4, aligning it with the bottom of the previously dropped vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (11, 4).

7. Drop the vertical block b13 at slot 3, aligning it with the top of the previously dropped horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (10, 3).

8. Drop another vertical block b13 at slot 3, aligning it with the bottom of the previously dropped vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (9, 3).

9. Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 4, aligning it with the top of the previously dropped vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (8, 4).

10. Drop the vertical block b13 at slot 5, aligning it with the bottom of the previously dropped horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (7, 5).

11. Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 4, aligning it with the top of the previously dropped vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (6, 4).

12. Drop the vertical block b13 at slot 3, aligning it with the bottom of the previously dropped horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (5, 3).

13. Drop another vertical block b13 at slot 3, aligning it with the top of the previously dropped vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (4, 3).

14. Drop the horizontal block b31 at slot 4, aligning it with the bottom of the previously dropped vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (3, 4).

15. Drop the square block b11 at slot 5, aligning it with the top of the previously dropped horizontal block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (2, 5).

16. Drop the square block b11 at slot 3, aligning it with the top of the previously dropped vertical block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```
This will result in the block being dropped at coordinates (2, 3).

17. The final structure will look like the uppercase character "B".

You can adjust the slots and coordinates as needed, but make sure to follow the stable structure guidelines and constraints mentioned.
