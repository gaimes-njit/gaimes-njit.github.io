To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "N", we can use the `ab_drop()` function in combination with the hard constraints provided.

First, we need to identify the positions and orders in which we should drop the blocks to form the "N" shape. Based on the given constraints, we can start by dropping the bottom part of the "N" shape, which consists of a b31 block and a b11 block.

To drop the b31 block, we can use the `ab_drop()` function with the block type 'b31' and an appropriate slot number as the block's center alignment. For example, we can drop it at slot 8:

```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

Next, we need to drop the b11 block on top of the b31 block. We can choose to drop it at slot 8 as well:

```
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

To ensure stability, we can check if the positions below the dropped blocks are empty before dropping a new block. We can also check if the positions adjacent to the dropped blocks have support from other blocks. For example, we can check if the positions (7, 8), (6, 8), and (6, 9) are empty and if position (5, 8) or position (5, 9) have support from adjacent blocks before proceeding to the next drop.

Once the bottom part of the "N" shape is stable, we can continue building the top part of the "N" shape. This consists of a b13 block dropped on top of the b31 block and two b31 blocks on both sides of the b13 block.

To drop the b13 block, we can use the `ab_drop()` function with the block type 'b13' and an appropriate slot number. For example, we can drop it at slot 7:

```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

To drop the two b31 blocks on both sides of the b13 block, we can use the `ab_drop()` function twice, each time with the block type 'b31' and an appropriate slot number. For example, we can drop them at slots 5 and 9:

```
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Again, we need to ensure stability by checking the positions below and adjacent to the dropped blocks before proceeding to the next drop.

By following this process, we can continue building the remaining parts of the "N" shape, adjusting the positions and orders of the blocks as necessary to meet the hard constraints and achieve stability.

Keep in mind that the actual coordinates of the ab_drop function should be determined based on the current state of the structure grid, considering the height (H) and width (W) of the grid. The provided example coordinates are only for illustrative purposes.
