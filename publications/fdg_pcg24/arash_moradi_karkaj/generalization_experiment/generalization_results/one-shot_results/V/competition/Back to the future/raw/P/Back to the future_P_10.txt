Possible approach:

1. Create a function, `is_stable()`, to check the stability of the structure after each drop. This function will iterate through each layer from bottom to top and check if there is any unsupported block. If a block is found without any support below it, the structure is considered unstable and the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

2. Create a function, `ab_drop()`, to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "P". This function will make use of the `is_stable()` function to check for stability after each drop.

3. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided initialization code.

4. Start building the structure from bottom to top, following the shape of the uppercase character "P". To ensure stability, drop blocks that require support from the bottom layers before adding blocks on top of them.

5. For each block type (b11, b13, b31), use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block at the appropriate slot. To determine the slot position, start from the center slot and move outward if necessary to avoid boundary intrusion.

6. After each drop, check the stability of the structure using the `is_stable()` function. If the structure becomes unstable, backtrack to the previous stable state and try a different slot position for the block.

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the desired structure resembling the uppercase character "P" is achieved.

8. Ensure that the generated content is diverse by randomizing the block types and slot positions for each drop.

9. Record the coordinates of each drop (x, y) to keep track of the structure's construction.

Note: This is just one possible approach to solve the problem. There may be other variations or optimizations depending on the specific requirements and constraints.
