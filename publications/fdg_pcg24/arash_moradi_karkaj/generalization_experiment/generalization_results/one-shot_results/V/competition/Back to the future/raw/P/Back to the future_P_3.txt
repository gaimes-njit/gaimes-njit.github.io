To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "P" and meets all the hard constraints, I would follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the positions to drop each block in order to form the letter "P" shape. Since the goal is to generate a diverse structure, the positions can vary each time the program is run. However, we need to ensure that the structure remains stable after each drop.

3. Start by dropping the b31 block in the middle of the first layer (layer 0) to form the vertical line of the "P" shape. To ensure stability, we can check if the positions (2,5), (2,4), and (2,6) are empty before dropping the block.

```python
if structure[2][4] == ' ' and structure[2][5] == ' ' and structure[2][6] == ' ':
    ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

4. Next, drop the b31 block one layer above the previous block to provide support. Again, check the stability by verifying that positions (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6) are empty.

```python
if structure[3][4] == ' ' and structure[3][5] == ' ' and structure[3][6] == ' ':
    ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

5. Finally, drop the b13 block on top of the vertical line to form the horizontal line of the "P" shape. Check the stability by ensuring that positions (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5) are empty.

```python
if structure[3][5] == ' ' and structure[4][5] == ' ' and structure[5][5] == ' ':
    ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

By following these steps, we generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "P" and meets all the hard constraints. The positions of the blocks can be adjusted to create different "P" shapes each time the program is run, providing diversity in the generated content.
