To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase letter "U" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the center of the base:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will ensure stability for the subsequent blocks.

3. Drop a b13 block on top of the b31 block at slot 7:
```
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```
This will create the vertical part of the "U" shape.

4. Drop a b13 block on top of the b31 block at slot 11:
```
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```
This will create the other vertical part of the "U" shape.

5. Drop a b31 block on top of the two b13 blocks at slot 9:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will connect the two vertical parts of the "U" shape.

6. Finally, drop a b11 block on top of the b31 block at slot 9:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
This will complete the "U" shape.

The resulting structure should resemble the uppercase letter "U" and satisfy the stability constraints.
