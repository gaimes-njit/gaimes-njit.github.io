To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "V" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully plan the placement of each block to satisfy all the constraints.

Here is a possible approach to achieve this:

1. Start by dropping a b31 block at the center slot (slot 9) using `ab_drop('b31', 9)` to create the bottom part of the "V". This block will provide stability and support for the upper parts.

2. Next, drop a b13 block at slot 7 using `ab_drop('b13', 7)`. This will be the left leg of the "V".

3. Drop another b13 block at slot 11 using `ab_drop('b13', 11)` to create the right leg of the "V".

4. To complete the top part of the "V", drop three b11 blocks at slots 8, 9, and 10 respectively using `ab_drop('b11', 8)`, `ab_drop('b11', 9)`, and `ab_drop('b11', 10)`.

The final structure will resemble the uppercase character "V" and meet all the hard constraints. The stability of the structure is ensured by the careful placement of each block, with the lower blocks providing support for the upper parts. The structure does not intrude on the boundary of the map, and the overall shape consists of b11, b13, and b31 blocks similar to the "V" shape.
