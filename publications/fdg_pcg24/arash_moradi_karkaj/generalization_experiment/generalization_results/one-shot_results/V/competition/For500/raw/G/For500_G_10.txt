Unfortunately, as an AI text-based model, I cannot execute code or perform interactive tasks like playing a game of Tetris. However, I can provide you with a general strategy using the `ab_drop()` function to help you generate a stable structure resembling the letter "G" in the game of Tetris.

Here's a possible series of `ab_drop()` function calls to create a stable structure resembling the letter "G":

1. Drop a 'b13' at index 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
2. Drop a 'b13' at index 2: `ab_drop('b13', 2)`
3. Drop a 'b31' at index 2: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`
4. Drop a 'b11' at index 1: `ab_drop('b11', 1)`
5. Drop a 'b11' at index 1: `ab_drop('b11', 1)`
6. Drop a 'b11' at index 1: `ab_drop('b11', 1)`
7. Drop a 'b11' at index 4: `ab_drop('b11', 4)`
8. Drop a 'b11' at index 5: `ab_drop('b11', 5)`
9. Drop a 'b11' at index 6: `ab_drop('b11', 6)`
10. Drop a 'b11' at index 7: `ab_drop('b11', 7)`
11. Drop a 'b11' at index 8: `ab_drop('b11', 8)`

Please note that this is just a possible solution, and there may be other valid ways to generate a stable structure resembling the letter "G" using the `ab_drop()` function.
