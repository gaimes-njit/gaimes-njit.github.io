First, let's initialize the field:

```python
field = [[' ' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, we can start generating the structure. Since we need to form a shape resembling the letter "C", we will start by placing a b13 brick vertically on the ground.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

This will occupy the cells (5, 0), (5, 1), and (5, 2). 

Next, we need to place a b31 brick horizontally above the b13 brick. We need to ensure stability, so the pivot point should have an equal number of occupied cells on both sides. To achieve this, we can place the b31 brick with an x_position of 6.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

This will occupy the cells (5, 3), (6, 3), and (7, 3). 

Finally, we can output the field to visualize the generated structure:

```python
for row in field:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The final structure should resemble the letter "C":

```
                    
    BBB             
    B               
    B               
    BBB             
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
```

Please note that the implementation of the `ab_drop()` function is not provided. This function should handle the logic of dropping the brick and checking for collisions with previously placed bricks.
