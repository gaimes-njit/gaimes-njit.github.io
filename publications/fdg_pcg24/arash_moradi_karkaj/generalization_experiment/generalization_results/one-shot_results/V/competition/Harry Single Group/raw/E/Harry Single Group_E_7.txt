Based on the provided instructions, let's start generating the structure resembling the letter "E". To ensure stability and avoid boundary collisions, we need to carefully place each brick.

Here is the code to generate the required structure:

```
# Map Initialization
map = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# ab_drop() function calls
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # First vertical line of the "E"
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 12)  # Horizontal line of the "E"
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Second vertical line of the "E"

# Print the final map
for row in map:
    print(row)
```

After executing the above code, the output will be:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
