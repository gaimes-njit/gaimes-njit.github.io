To generate the shape resembling the letter "I", we can use the following steps:

1. Initialize the field with a 2D array of zeros, representing the empty cells.

```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Use the ab_drop() function to place bricks on the field.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)   # Place the first vertical brick at x_position=8
ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Place the horizontal brick on top of the vertical brick at x_position=7
```

3. Verify the stability of the structure by checking the number of occupied cells on each side of the pivot.

```python
def check_stability():
    left_count = sum(field[y][x] == 1 for y in range(16) for x in range(7))
    right_count = sum(field[y][x] == 1 for y in range(16) for x in range(9, 20))
    return left_count == right_count

stability = check_stability()
```

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to complete the structure.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Place another horizontal brick on top of the existing structure at x_position=7
ab_drop('b13', 8)   # Place another vertical brick on top of the existing structure at x_position=8

ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Place another horizontal brick on top of the existing structure at x_position=7
ab_drop('b13', 8)   # Place another vertical brick on top of the existing structure at x_position=8

ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Place another horizontal brick on top of the existing structure at x_position=7
```

5. Verify the stability of the final structure.

```python
final_stability = check_stability()
```

Now, the structure resembling the letter "I" should be generated on the field, satisfying the stability and boundary collision requirements.
