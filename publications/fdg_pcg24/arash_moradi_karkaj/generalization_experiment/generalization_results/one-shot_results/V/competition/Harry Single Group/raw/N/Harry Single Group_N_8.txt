To form a shape resembling the letter "N", we can use the available props b31, b13, and b11. 

To start, let's initialize the 20x16 field with zeros to represent empty cells:

```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Next, we'll use the ab_drop function to place the bricks in the desired formation:

```python
# Place the first vertical brick
ab_drop('b13', 5)

# Place the horizontal brick above the vertical brick
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Place the second vertical brick
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

The ab_drop function will automatically check for stability and boundary collisions, so we don't need to worry about those conditions.

Here's the complete code:

```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

After executing this code, the cells representing the shape resembling the letter "N" will be occupied with the respective bricks.
