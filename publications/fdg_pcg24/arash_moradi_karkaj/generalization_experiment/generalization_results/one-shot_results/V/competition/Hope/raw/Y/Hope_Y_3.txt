The code to create the structure like "Y" inside a 20*16 box using the provided block types and ab_drop function is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

Explanation:
- The first line creates a 1*3 block ('b13') starting from position (3,0) and goes down to position (3,2).
- The second line creates another 1*3 block ('b13') starting from position (6,0) and goes down to position (6,2).
- The third line creates a 3*1 block ('b31') with the center at position (5,1). Therefore, it starts from position (4,0) and goes down to position (6,2).

This arrangement of blocks forms the shape of the letter "Y" within the given 20*16 box.
