To generate the uppercase English letter "C", we can use the following `ab_drop()` commands:

```
ab_drop(b31, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 4)
ab_drop(b13, 4)
ab_drop(b13, 4)
ab_drop(b31, 1)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block `b31` at position 1 to form the top of the letter "C".
2. Place a vertical straight block `b13` at position 4 to form the vertical portion of the letter "C".
3. Repeat step 2 three more times to complete the vertical portion of the letter "C".
4. Place another horizontal straight block `b31` at position 1 to form the bottom of the letter "C".

The resulting letter "C" should be created within the allowed space boundaries and properly stacked according to the gravity rules.
