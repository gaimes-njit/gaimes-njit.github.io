To create the uppercase letter "Y" using the given block types and environment, we will need to strategically place the blocks in a way that resembles the letter shape. Here is a possible solution:

```
ab_drop(b11, 9)
ab_drop(b31, 9)
ab_drop(b13, 11)
ab_drop(b31, 7)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 9 on the grid.
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 9 on the grid, partially overlapping with the previous block.
3. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 11 on the grid, extending downwards from the previous block.
4. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 7 on the grid, partially overlapping with the previous blocks.

This arrangement of blocks should resemble the uppercase letter "Y" within the given environment and gravity rules.
