To generate the uppercase letter Z, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop(b31,1)
ab_drop(b11,4)
ab_drop(b31,5)
ab_drop(b11,8)
ab_drop(b31,9)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop(b31,1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1, creating the top line of the letter Z.
- The second command `ab_drop(b11,4)` places a square block at position 4, filling the gap in the middle of the letter Z.
- The third command `ab_drop(b31,5)` places another horizontal straight block at position 5, creating the bottom line of the letter Z.
- The fourth command `ab_drop(b11,8)` places a square block at position 8, filling the remaining gap in the middle of the letter Z.
- The fifth command `ab_drop(b31,9)` places a final horizontal straight block at position 9, completing the letter Z.

Executing these commands will result in the generated uppercase letter Z within the allowed space boundaries.
