To generate the uppercase letter "A", we can use the following steps:

1. Place two b31 blocks horizontally at positions 1 and 4 to create the two side lines of the letter "A":
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

2. Place a b13 block vertically at position 2 to create the middle line of the letter "A":
```
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

3. Place a b31 block horizontally at position 2, on top of the b13 block, to bridge the two side lines:
```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

4. Place a b31 block horizontally at position 3, on top of the b13 block, to further bridge the two side lines:
```
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "A" would be:
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```
