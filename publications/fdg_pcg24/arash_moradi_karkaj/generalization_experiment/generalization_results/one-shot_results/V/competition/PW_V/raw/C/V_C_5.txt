To generate the uppercase English letter "C", you will need to use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Place the horizontal straight block at the leftmost position
ab_drop('b31', 2)  // Place another horizontal straight block next to the previous one
ab_drop('b31', 3)  // Place a third horizontal straight block next to the previous two
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Place the vertical straight block at the top of the leftmost horizontal block
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Place another vertical straight block at the top of the rightmost horizontal block
```

This will create a stable and accurately represented uppercase letter "C" in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules.
