Explanation: To create the letter "V", we start by placing two vertical straight blocks of width 1 in positions 1 and 2 along the width. Then, we place a horizontal straight block of width 3 in position 2. Finally, we place three 1x1 square blocks in positions 3, 1, and 3 along the width. This forms the letter "V".
