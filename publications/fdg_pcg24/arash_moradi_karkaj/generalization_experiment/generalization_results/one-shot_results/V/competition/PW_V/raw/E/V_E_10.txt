To generate the uppercase English letter "E", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```

This will construct the letter "E" in the Tetris-like environment, while ensuring stability and fitting within the boundaries.
