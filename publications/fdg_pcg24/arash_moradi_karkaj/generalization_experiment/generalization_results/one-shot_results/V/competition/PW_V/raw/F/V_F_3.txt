To generate the uppercase letter "F" in the defined environment, we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

Explanation:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to form the top of the "F".
2. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 2 to form the vertical line in the middle of the "F".
3. Place another 1x1 square block (b11) at position 2 to extend the vertical line in the middle.
4. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 to form the bottom part of the vertical line.
5. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 3 to create the horizontal line at the bottom of the "F".
6. Place another 1x1 square block (b11) at position 2 to complete the horizontal line at the bottom.
7. Place another 1x1 square block (b11) at position 2 to extend the horizontal line at the bottom.
8. Place another 1x1 square block (b11) at position 2 to complete the horizontal line at the bottom.

By following these commands, the letter "F" will be accurately represented and fit within the allowed space boundaries.
