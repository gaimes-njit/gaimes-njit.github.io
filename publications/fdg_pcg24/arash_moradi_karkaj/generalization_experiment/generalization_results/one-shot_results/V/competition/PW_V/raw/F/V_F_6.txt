```
ab_drop("b13",1)
ab_drop("b13",2)
ab_drop("b31",2)
ab_drop("b13",3)
ab_drop("b13",4)
```
In this example, the letter "V" is generated by stacking two vertical blocks (b13) on top of each other, followed by a horizontal block (b31) in the middle, and then stacking two more vertical blocks (b13) on top of each other. This creates the shape of the letter "V".
