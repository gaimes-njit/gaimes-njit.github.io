To generate the uppercase English letter "G", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop(b31, 1)
ab_drop(b31, 2)
ab_drop(b31, 3)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b11, 3)
ab_drop(b11, 4)
ab_drop(b11, 5)
ab_drop(b11, 6)
ab_drop(b11, 7)
ab_drop(b11, 8)
ab_drop(b11, 9)
ab_drop(b13, 10)
ab_drop(b31, 10)
ab_drop(b31, 11)
ab_drop(b31, 12)
ab_drop(b31, 13)
ab_drop(b31, 14)
ab_drop(b31, 15)
ab_drop(b13, 13)
```

This stream of commands will place the blocks in the correct positions to form the uppercase letter "G" within the allowed space boundaries. The blocks are dropped sequentially from left to right, top to bottom, starting from the X position 1.
