To generate the uppercase letter "J" using the given block types and gravity rules, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Place the first block at position 1, creating the vertical line of the letter J
ab_drop('b11', 2)  // Place the second block at position 2, extending the line horizontally
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Place the third block at position 3, creating the bottom of the letter J
ab_drop('b11', 3)  // Place the fourth block at position 3, extending the bottom of the letter J
```

By executing these commands consecutively, we will be able to construct the uppercase letter "J" within the allowed space boundaries while maintaining structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
