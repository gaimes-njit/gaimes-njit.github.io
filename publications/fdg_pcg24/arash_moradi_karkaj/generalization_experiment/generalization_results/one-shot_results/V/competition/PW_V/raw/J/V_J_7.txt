To generate the uppercase letter "J", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

Explanation:
- We start by placing three horizontal straight blocks (b31) at positions 1, 2, and 3 along the width to form the top part of the letter "J".
- Then, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 3 to form the vertical line of the letter "J".
