To generate the uppercase letter "K" in the defined environment using the ab_drop() command and block types, follow the instructions below:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at X position 1
ab_drop("b31", 2)   # Place a horizontal straight block at X position 2
ab_drop("b31", 3)   # Place a horizontal straight block at X position 3
ab_drop("b13", 2)   # Place a vertical straight block at X position 2
ab_drop("b13", 4)   # Place a vertical straight block at X position 4
ab_drop("b11", 3)   # Place a square block at X position 3
```

Executing these commands consecutively will result in the creation of the uppercase letter "K" in the defined environment while ensuring structural stability and following the gravity rules.
