ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Explanation: To generate the letter "V," we start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. Then we place a vertical straight block (b13) at positions 4 and 5. Finally, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 8 and a single square block (b11) at position 9.

P:equal to 'P'
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
```

Explanation: To generate the letter "P," we start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. Then we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4. Next, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 8, followed by another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 10. Finally, we place a single square block (b11) at position 12.

H:equal to 'H'
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
```

Explanation: To generate the letter "H," we start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. Then we place two more horizontal straight blocks (b31) at positions 4 and 8. Next, we place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4 to create the middle section of the letter. Finally, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 12 to complete the letter.

Note: Please ensure that the blocks are placed in the given order and positions to accurately represent the desired letters.
