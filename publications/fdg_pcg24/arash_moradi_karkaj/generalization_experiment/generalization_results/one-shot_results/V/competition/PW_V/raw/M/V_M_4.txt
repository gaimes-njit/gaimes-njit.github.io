```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
```

This would create the letter "V" by stacking three vertical straight blocks (b13) and adding a horizontal straight block (b31) on top. Finally, two 1x1 square blocks (b11) would be placed on the sides to complete the shape.
