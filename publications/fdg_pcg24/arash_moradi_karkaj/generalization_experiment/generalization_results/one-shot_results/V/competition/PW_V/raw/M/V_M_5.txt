Here's how to generate the uppercase letter "M" using the ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at the leftmost position
ab_drop("b31", 5)  # Place the second horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units
ab_drop("b11", 4)  # Place the square block in the middle of the two horizontal blocks
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the third horizontal straight block with a width of 3 units
ab_drop("b31", 13)  # Place the fourth horizontal straight block at the rightmost position
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "M" using the given block types.
