To generate the uppercase English letter "O", we can start by placing two vertical straight blocks (b13) next to each other at the top of the grid. Then, we can place a horizontal straight block (b31) below the two vertical blocks to form the top part of the letter "O". Finally, we can place another two vertical blocks below the horizontal block to complete the letter "O". 

Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the letter "O":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
