To generate uppercase English letter "S", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "S" in the grid.
