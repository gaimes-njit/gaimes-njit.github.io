To generate the uppercase letter "T" using the ab_drop() commands, we can use the following sequence:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1. This forms the top part of the "T".
2. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2. This forms the vertical part of the "T", extending downwards.
3. Place a square block ('b11') at position 2. This completes the vertical part of the "T", creating the letter shape.

By following these instructions, the letters should accurately represent the uppercase letter "T" within the allowed space boundaries.
