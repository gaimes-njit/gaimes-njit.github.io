You can use the following stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "U":

```
ab_drop("b31",1)
ab_drop("b13",1)
ab_drop("b13",4)
ab_drop("b31",4)
ab_drop("b31",7)
ab_drop("b13",7)
```

Please note that you need to execute the above commands consecutively and make sure to place the blocks within the allowed space boundaries.
