To generate the uppercase letter "W", we can use a combination of block types b31 and b13. The letter "W" has four vertical lines, so we can use four b13 blocks stacked on top of each other. Additionally, there are two diagonal lines connecting the vertical lines, which can be created using two b31 blocks placed diagonally.

Here is the sequence of ab_drop() commands to generate the uppercase letter "W":

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
ab_drop("b13", 15)
ab_drop("b13", 16)
```

Once you execute these commands in the specified environment, you should see the uppercase letter "W" formed by the stacked blocks.
