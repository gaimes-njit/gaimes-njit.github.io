To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we can use a combination of block types b31 and b13. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to create the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

Explanation:
- The first three ab_drop() commands create the three horizontal lines of the letter "W" using block type b31.
- The fourth ab_drop() command creates the first vertical line of the letter "W" using block type b13.
- The fifth ab_drop() command creates the second vertical line of the letter "W" using block type b13.

The resulting shape will resemble the uppercase letter "W" within the allowed space boundaries.
