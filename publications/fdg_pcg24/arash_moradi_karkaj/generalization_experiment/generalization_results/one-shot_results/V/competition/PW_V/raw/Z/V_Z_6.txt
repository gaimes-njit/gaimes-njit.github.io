To generate the uppercase letter "Z", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

Explanation:

1. Place a horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 1. This forms the top part of the letter "Z".
2. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 2. This connects the top and bottom parts of the letter "Z".
3. Place another horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 4. This forms the bottom part of the letter "Z".
4. Place a 1x1 square block (`b11`) at position 4. This completes the middle part of the letter "Z".
5. Place another horizontal straight block (`b31`) at position 7. This extends the bottom part of the letter "Z".
6. Place a vertical straight block (`b13`) at position 7. This connects the bottom part of the letter "Z" to the ground.

By following these commands, you will be able to generate the uppercase letter "Z" within the defined environment while adhering to the gravity rules.
