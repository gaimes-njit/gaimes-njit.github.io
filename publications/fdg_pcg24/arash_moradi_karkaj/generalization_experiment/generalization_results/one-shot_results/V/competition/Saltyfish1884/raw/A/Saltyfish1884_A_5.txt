Before starting to generate the structure that resembles the character "A", let's analyze the constraints and think about the shape of the structure.

First, let's consider constraint 5.1 which states the stability rules:
1) A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. This means that the b31 block should be placed on the bottom layer or on top of a b11 or b13 block.
2) Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing. This means that the blocks should be placed on the bottom layers whenever possible.
3) The structure should not be separated. This means that there should not be empty layers between blocks.

Considering these stability rules, we can determine the shape of the structure that resembles the character "A". It will consist of two b31 blocks placed on the bottom layer, forming the slanted sides of the "A", and a b13 block placed on top of the two b31 blocks, forming the top of the "A".

Now, we can use the ab_drop() function to generate the structure. We will start by dropping the b31 blocks on the bottom layer, aligning them with slots 4 and 15. Then, we will drop the b13 block on top of the two b31 blocks, aligning it with slot 10.

The code to generate the structure that resembles the character "A" can be written as follows:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# drop the two b31 blocks on the bottom layer
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 15)

# drop the b13 block on top of the b31 blocks
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

This will generate a stable structure in the shape of the character "A" while meeting all the hard constraints. The resulting structure will be stored in the `structure` variable.
