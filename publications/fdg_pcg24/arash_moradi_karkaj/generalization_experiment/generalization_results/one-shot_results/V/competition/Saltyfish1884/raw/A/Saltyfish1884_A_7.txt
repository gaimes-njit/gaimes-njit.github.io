To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "A" while meeting all hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here is the step-by-step process:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Start with the bottom layer (layer 0) and place a b11 block at the center slot (slot 10) to form the base.
ab_drop('b11', 10)

Step 3: Place two b13 blocks on top of the base to form the vertical legs of the "A". These blocks should be placed symmetrically on both sides of the base.
ab_drop('b13', 7)  # left leg
ab_drop('b13', 13)  # right leg

Step 4: Place a b31 block on top of the base, aligned with the center slot. This block will form the crossbar of the "A".
ab_drop('b31', 10)

Step 5: Place two b31 blocks on top of the bottom crossbar, aligned with the slots on either side. These blocks will form the slanted parts of the "A".
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # left slant
ab_drop('b31', 13)  # right slant

Step 6: The final structure should resemble the character "A". Print the structure to visualize the result.
