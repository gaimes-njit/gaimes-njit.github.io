To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "C" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
2. Place a b31 block on the base (layer 0) at a suitable slot, ensuring stability.
3. Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with its center, ensuring stability.
4. Place another b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with its center, ensuring stability.
5. Place a b13 block on top of the second b31 block, aligned with its center, ensuring stability.
6. Place a b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with its center, ensuring stability.
7. Place a b13 block on top of the fifth b31 block, aligned with its center, ensuring stability.
8. Place a b31 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with its center, ensuring stability.

The resulting structure will resemble the character "C" and will meet all the hard constraints of stability. To achieve this, we can use the ab_drop() function as follows:

```python
# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Place the blocks using ab_drop() function
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place the first b31 block on the base at slot 3
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place the b13 block on top of the first b31 block
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place the second b31 block on top of the b13 block
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place the second b13 block on top of the second b31 block
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place the third b31 block on top of the second b13 block
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place the third b13 block on top of the third b31 block
ab_drop('b31', 3)   # Place the fourth b31 block on top of the third b13 block
```

After running this code, the structure will resemble the character "C" and meet all the hard constraints of stability.

Note: The specific slot number used may vary depending on the desired position of the structure in the grid.
