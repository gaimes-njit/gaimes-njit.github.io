To generate a stable structure resembling the character "M" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions W (width) and H (height).
2. Place a b31 block at the center of the bottom layer (layer 0) to act as the base.
3. Drop two b13 blocks on either side of the base to form the legs of the "M" shape. These blocks should be placed on top of the base to ensure stability.
4. Drop a b11 block in the center of the structure above the base, forming the middle part of the "M" shape.
5. Drop two b11 blocks diagonally above the legs, forming the upper part of the "M" shape.
6. Drop a b11 block on top of the middle part of the "M" shape, completing the structure.

The code to achieve this using the ab_drop() function would be as follows:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Place base
base_slot = W // 2
ab_drop('b31', base_slot)

# Step 3: Place legs
leg1_slot = base_slot - 2
leg2_slot = base_slot + 2
ab_drop('b13', leg1_slot)
ab_drop('b13', leg2_slot)

# Step 4: Place middle part
middle_slot = base_slot
ab_drop('b11', middle_slot)

# Step 5: Place upper part
upper_slot1 = middle_slot - 2
upper_slot2 = middle_slot + 2
ab_drop('b11', upper_slot1)
ab_drop('b11', upper_slot2)

# Step 6: Place top
top_slot = middle_slot
ab_drop('b11', top_slot)

# Print the structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "M" and will meet all the given requirements.
