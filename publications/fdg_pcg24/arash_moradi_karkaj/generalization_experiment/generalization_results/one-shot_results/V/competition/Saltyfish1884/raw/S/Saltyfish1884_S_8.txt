To generate a stable structure resembling the character "S" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b31 block to create the base:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will drop the b31 block centered at slot 9, creating a stable base at layer 0.

3. Drop the b11 block on top of the base:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
This will drop the b11 block centered at slot 9, on top of the base.

4. Drop the b13 block on top of the b11 block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```
This will drop the b13 block centered at slot 8, on top of the b11 block.

5. Drop the b11 block next to the b13 block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
This will drop the b11 block centered at slot 10, next to the b13 block.

6. Drop the b31 block on top of the b11 and b13 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will drop the b31 block centered at slot 9, on top of the b11 and b13 blocks.

7. Drop the b11 block next to the b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
This will drop the b11 block centered at slot 10, next to the b31 block.

8. Drop the b13 block on top of the b11 and b31 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```
This will drop the b13 block centered at slot 8, on top of the b11 and b31 blocks.

9. Drop the b11 block next to the b13 block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
This will drop the b11 block centered at slot 10, next to the b13 block.

10. Drop the b31 block on top of the b11 and b13 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will drop the b31 block centered at slot 9, on top of the b11 and b13 blocks.

11. Drop the b11 block next to the b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
This will drop the b11 block centered at slot 10, next to the b31 block.

12. Drop the b13 block on top of the b11 and b31 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```
This will drop the b13 block centered at slot 8, on top of the b11 and b31 blocks.

13. Drop the b11 block next to the b13 block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
This will drop the b11 block centered at slot 10, next to the b13 block.

14. Drop the b31 block on top of the b11 and b13 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will drop the b31 block centered at slot 9, on top of the b11 and b13 blocks.

15. Drop the b11 block next to the b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
This will drop the b11 block centered at slot 10, next to the b31 block.

16. Drop the b13 block on top of the b11 and b31 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```
This will drop the b13 block centered at slot 8, on top of the b11 and b31 blocks.

17. Drop the b11 block next to the b13 block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
This will drop the b11 block centered at slot 10, next to the b13 block.

18. Drop the b31 block on top of the b11 and b13 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will drop the b31 block centered at slot 9, on top of the b11 and b13 blocks.

19. Drop the b11 block next to the b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b11', 10)
```
This will drop the b11 block centered at slot 10, next to the b31 block.

20. Drop the b13 block on top of the b11 and b31 blocks:
```
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```
This will drop the b13 block centered at slot 8, on top of the b11 and b31 blocks.

This series of block dropping steps should generate a stable structure resembling the character "S" while meeting all the hard constraints.
