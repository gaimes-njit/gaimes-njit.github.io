To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "V" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.

2. Place two b31 blocks on the bottom layer (layer 0) to act as the base of the "V". This ensures stability and prevents overhangs.

3. Place two b11 blocks on top of the b31 blocks in the middle slots to form the center of the "V".

4. Place two b13 blocks on top of the b11 blocks to complete the structure of the "V".

5. Check that the structure is stable by iterating through each position in the structure and ensuring that any block is resting on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) and not hanging in mid-air.

6. If the structure is stable, print the resulting structure.

Here's an example implementation in Python:

```python
W = 20
H = 16

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Place the base blocks
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 11)

# Place the center blocks
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# Place the top blocks
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 10)

# Check stability
is_stable = True
for i in range(1, H):
    for j in range(W):
        if structure[i][j] != ' ' and structure[i-1][j] == ' ':
            is_stable = False
            break

# Print the resulting structure if stable
if is_stable:
    for row in structure:
        print(' '.join(row))
else:
    print("Structure is not stable.")
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "V" while meeting all the given constraints. Feel free to modify the slot positions and block types to create different structures.
