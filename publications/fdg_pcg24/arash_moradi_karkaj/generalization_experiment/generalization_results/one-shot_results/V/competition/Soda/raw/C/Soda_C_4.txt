To create a capital "C" in the level, we can use the following steps:

1. Drop the top bar of the "C" using a row block (b31) at x_position=9.
2. Drop the vertical pipe of the "C" using a column block (b13) at x_position=8.
3. Drop the bottom bar of the "C" using a row block (b31) at x_position=9.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
