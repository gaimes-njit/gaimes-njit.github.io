To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "G", we can break it down into three blocks: a row block (b31) for the top horizontal line, a column block (b13) for the vertical line on the left, and a square block (b11) for the bottom horizontal line.

Here is the complete implementation to generate the "G" structure:

```
# Drop the row block (b31) at x_position=9
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Drop the column block (b13) at x_position=7
ab_drop("b13", 7)

# Drop the square block (b11) at x_position=12
ab_drop("b11", 12)
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion and follows the recommended positions for each block type to achieve the desired shape.

Note: The stability of the structure depends on the implementation of the `ab_drop()` function and the underlying physics engine.
