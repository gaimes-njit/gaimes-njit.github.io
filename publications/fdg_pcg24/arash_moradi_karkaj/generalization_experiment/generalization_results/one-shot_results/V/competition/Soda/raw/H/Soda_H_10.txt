To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital "H", we can break it down into three blocks: two vertical bars and one horizontal bar connecting them.

Step 1: Place the two vertical bars

To create the two vertical bars of the "H", we will use the block type "b13" and drop it in the grid at specific positions.

```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
```

Step 2: Place the horizontal bar

To create the horizontal bar of the "H", we will use the block type "b31" and drop it in the grid at the center position.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Complete Implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
