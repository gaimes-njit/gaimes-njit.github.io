To create a structure that looks like the letter "H" in the level, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the horizontal bar of the "H"
We can use the "b31" block to create the horizontal bar of the "H" at the bottom of the level. We can drop it at the center position (x_position = 9):

ab_drop("b31", 9)

Step 2: Place the vertical bars of the "H"
Next, we need to create the two vertical bars of the "H" on both sides of the horizontal bar. We can use the "b13" block to do this.

Place the left vertical bar: 
ab_drop("b13", 7)

Place the right vertical bar:
ab_drop("b13", 11)

Step 3: Place the upper horizontal bar of the "H"
Finally, we need to create the upper horizontal bar of the "H" to complete the structure. We can again use the "b31" block for this.

Place the upper horizontal bar:
ab_drop("b31", 9)

Overall, the complete implementation to build the "H" structure in the level would look like this:

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
