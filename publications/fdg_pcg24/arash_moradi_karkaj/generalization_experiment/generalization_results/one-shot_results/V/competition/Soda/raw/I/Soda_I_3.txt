To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "I", we can start by placing a row block ("b31") at the bottom center of the grid. This will serve as the base of the "I". 

Next, we can place a column block ("b13") on top of the row block, centered horizontally. This will create the vertical bar of the "I".

Finally, we can place another row block on top of the column block, centered horizontally. This will create the horizontal bar of the "I".

The complete implementation, ensuring stability and similarity, is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the base row block at x_position=9
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place the column block on top of the base, centered horizontally
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the top row block on top of the column, centered horizontally

```

After executing the above code, the level will have a structure resembling the capital letter "I", with the bottom row block serving as the base, a column block in the middle, and another row block on top.
