To build the capital letter "M", we can break it down into three parts - the two diagonal lines and the middle column. 

To start, we will build the two diagonal lines of the "M". We will use the b31 block for this.

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)  # Drop the block type "b31" at x_position=6
ab_drop("b31", 14)  # Drop the block type "b31" at x_position=14
```

Next, we will build the middle column of the "M". We will use the b13 block for this.

```
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Drop the block type "b13" at x_position=10
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to build the letter "M" is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)  # Drop the block type "b31" at x_position=6
ab_drop("b31", 14)  # Drop the block type "b31" at x_position=14
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Drop the block type "b13" at x_position=10
```
