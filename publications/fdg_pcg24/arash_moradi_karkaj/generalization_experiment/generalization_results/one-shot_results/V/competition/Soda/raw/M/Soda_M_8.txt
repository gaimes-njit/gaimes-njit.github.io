To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "M" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can follow the approach below:

Step 1: Place the middle column block (b13) at the center of the grid:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Step 2: Place the two side row blocks (b31) on each side of the middle column block:
```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Step 3: Place the top row block (b31) centered above the middle column block:
```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

Complete implementation:
```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

This implementation will generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "M" in a bottom-to-top fashion, while ensuring stability and similarity to the target character.
