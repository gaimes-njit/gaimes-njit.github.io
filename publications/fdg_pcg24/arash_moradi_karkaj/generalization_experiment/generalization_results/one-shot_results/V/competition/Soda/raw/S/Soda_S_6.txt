First, let's start by creating the base of the letter S. We will use the "b31" block type to create a row block at the bottom of the grid.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, let's create the curves of the letter S. We will use the "b13" block type to create two column blocks.

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

Finally, let's complete the letter S by adding the middle bar. We will use the "b31" block type again.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This completes the implementation. The final code block with the series of ab_drop() calls is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
