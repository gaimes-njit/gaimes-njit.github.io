To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "Z" in Tetris, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a row block (b31) at the leftmost position (x_position = 0):

ab_drop("b31", 0)

2. Drop a square block (b11) at the position to the right of the previous row block (x_position = 1):

ab_drop("b11", 1)

3. Finally, drop another row block (b31) at the position to the right of the previous square block (x_position = 2):

ab_drop("b31", 2)

Complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
