To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "E" and meets all the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define the block shapes:
```python
block_shapes = {
    'b11': [(0, 0)],
    'b31': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)],
    'b13': [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (-2, 0)]
}
```

3. Drop the blocks to create the structure:
```python
# First, drop b31 block to form the left vertical line of "E"
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Next, drop b13 block to form the left horizontal line of "E"
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Then, drop b31 block to form the middle horizontal line of "E"
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Finally, drop b31 block to form the right vertical line of "E"
ab_drop('b31', 11)
```

4. Check the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints:
```python
# Check stability constraint
# Iterate through each layer from bottom to top
for y in range(1, H):
    # Iterate through each slot
    for x in range(W):
        if structure[y][x] == 'x':
            # Check if there is an empty slot below the current block
            if structure[y-1][x] == ' ':
                print("Stability constraint violated!")
                break

# Check no boundary intrusion constraint
invasion_area = 0
# Iterate through each layer
for y in range(H):
    # Check left boundary
    if structure[y][0] == 'x':
        invasion_area += 1
    # Check right boundary
    if structure[y][W-1] == 'x':
        invasion_area += 1

# Iterate through each slot on the top layer
for x in range(1, W-1):
    # Check top boundary
    if structure[H-1][x] == 'x':
        invasion_area += 1

if invasion_area > 0:
    print("No boundary intrusion constraint violated!")
```

5. Output the generated structure:
```python
for row in structure:
    print("".join(row))
```

This approach uses the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a sequential order to create a stable structure that resembles the character "E". It also checks the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints to ensure the generated structure is valid.
