To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and meets all the constraints, the following steps can be followed:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the vertical block (b13) at the slot 0 and layer 0 to form the base of the "F" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

3. Drop the horizontal block (b31) at the slot 0 and layer 1 to form the vertical line of the "F" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   ```

4. Drop the horizontal block (b31) at the slot 1 and layer 2 to form the horizontal line of the "F" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

5. Drop the square block (b11) at the slot 0 and layer 2 to complete the top of the "F" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 0)
   ```

By following these steps, a stable structure that looks like the character "F" can be generated while satisfying all the constraints. The blocks are dropped in a sequence that ensures stability and avoids any boundary intrusion.
