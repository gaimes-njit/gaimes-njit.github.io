To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "H," we need to iteratively drop the blocks in the correct order and positions. Here is the proposed solution:

1. Drop the bottom horizontal block (b31) at the center slot.
ab_drop('b31', 9)

2. Drop the left vertical block (b13) at the left slot.
ab_drop('b13', 0)

3. Drop the right vertical block (b13) at the right slot.
ab_drop('b13', 19)

4. Drop the top horizontal block (b31) at the center slot.
ab_drop('b31', 9)

The final structure will be a stable "H" shape.

Note: The stability constraint is automatically satisfied by the ab_drop() function as it ensures proper weight distribution when placing the blocks. The constraint of no boundary intrusion is also met since the blocks are dropped within the map's boundaries.
