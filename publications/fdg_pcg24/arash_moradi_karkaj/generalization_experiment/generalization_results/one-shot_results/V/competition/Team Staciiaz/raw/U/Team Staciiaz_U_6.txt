To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "U" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the base of the "U" by calling `ab_drop('b31', 9)`, which will drop a 3x1 block at the center slot (slot 9) on layer 0.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Drop the left vertical block of the "U" by calling `ab_drop('b13', 4)`, which will drop a 1x3 block at slot 4 on the layer above the base.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

4. Drop the right vertical block of the "U" by calling `ab_drop('b13', 14)`, which will drop a 1x3 block at slot 14 on the layer above the base.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```

5. The resulting structure should now resemble the character "U" and meet the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints.

Note: The order in which the blocks are dropped is crucial to ensure stability. By dropping the base block first, followed by the vertical blocks, we can create a stable structure that resembles the character "U" and satisfies all the constraints.

```python
# Step 1: Initialize structure
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Drop base of "U"
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Step 3: Drop left vertical block of "U"
ab_drop('b13', 4)

# Step 4: Drop right vertical block of "U"
ab_drop('b13', 14)
```
