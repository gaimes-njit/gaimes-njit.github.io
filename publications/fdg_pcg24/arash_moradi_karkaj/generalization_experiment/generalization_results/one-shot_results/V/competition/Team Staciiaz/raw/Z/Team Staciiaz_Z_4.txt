To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Z" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet:
   ```
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. First, we need to drop a vertical block `b13` at slot 0 (x position) to construct the vertical line of the "Z" shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

3. Next, drop a horizontal block `b31` at slot 1 (x position) to form the top line of the "Z" shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

4. To form the diagonal line of the "Z" shape, we need to drop three square blocks `b11`. Start from slot 1 (x position) and iterate up to slot 3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop each block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 1)  # Drop the first square block
   ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Drop the second square block
   ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Drop the third square block
   ```

5. Next, drop a horizontal block `b31` at slot 4 (x position) to form the bottom line of the "Z" shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 4)
   ```

6. Finally, drop a vertical block `b13` at slot 7 (x position) to complete the vertical line of the "Z" shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 7)
   ```

By following these steps, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Z" and meets all the given constraints.
