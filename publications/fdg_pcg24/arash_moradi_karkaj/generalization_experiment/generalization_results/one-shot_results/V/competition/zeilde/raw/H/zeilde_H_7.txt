1. Here is the drawing of the letter "H" with asterisks:
```
*     *
*     *
******
*     *
*     *
```
2. Line-by-line, verbally listing the asterisks and spaces generated in each row:
- Row 1: 1 asterisk, 5 spaces, 1 asterisk
- Row 2: 1 asterisk, 5 spaces, 1 asterisk
- Row 3: 6 asterisks
- Row 4: 1 asterisk, 5 spaces, 1 asterisk
- Row 5: 1 asterisk, 5 spaces, 1 asterisk
3. The asterisks are now referred to as "x" and the spaces as "y". Repeat step #2 with the new rules:
- Row 1: 1x, 5y, 1x
- Row 2: 1x, 5y, 1x
- Row 3: 6x
- Row 4: 1x, 5y, 1x
- Row 5: 1x, 5y, 1x
4. For each row, writing out each x and y side-by-side:
- Row 1: xyyyyyx
- Row 2: xyyyyyx
- Row 3: xxxxxxx
- Row 4: xyyyyyx
- Row 5: xyyyyyx
5. For each row, indicating the position of each variable:
- Row 1: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; y-5; y-6; y-7; x-8
- Row 2: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; y-5; y-6; y-7; x-8
- Row 3: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5; x-6; x-7
- Row 4: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; y-5; y-6; y-7; x-8
- Row 5: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; y-5; y-6; y-7; x-8
6. For each row, returning the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:
ab_drop("b11", 1)ab_drop("b11", 2)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 4)ab_drop("b11", 5)ab_drop("b11", 6)ab_drop("b11", 7)ab_drop("b11", 8)ab_drop("b11", 9)ab_drop("b11", 10)ab_drop("b11", 11)ab_drop("b11", 12)ab_drop("b11", 13)ab_drop("b11", 14)ab_drop("b11", 15)ab_drop("b11", 16)ab_drop("b11", 17)ab_drop("b11", 18)ab_drop("b11", 19)
