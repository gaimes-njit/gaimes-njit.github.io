1. Here is the drawing of the letter "L" with asterisks:

```
*****
*
*
*
*
```

2. Line-by-line, the asterisks and spaces generated in each row are:

- Row 1: 5 asterisks
- Row 2: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces
- Row 3: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces
- Row 4: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces
- Row 5: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces

3. Using "x" for asterisks and "y" for spaces, the representation of each row would be:

- Row 1: "xxxxx"
- Row 2: "xyyyy"
- Row 3: "xyyyy"
- Row 4: "xyyyy"
- Row 5: "xyyyy"

4. For each row, the sequence of "x" and "y" would be:

- Row 1: "xxxxx"
- Row 2: "xyyyy"
- Row 3: "xyyyy"
- Row 4: "xyyyy"
- Row 5: "xyyyy"

5. The position of each variable in each row would be:

- Row 1: x-1, x-2, x-3, x-4, x-5
- Row 2: x-1, y-2, y-3, y-4, y-5
- Row 3: x-1, y-2, y-3, y-4, y-5
- Row 4: x-1, y-2, y-3, y-4, y-5
- Row 5: x-1, y-2, y-3, y-4, y-5

6. The `ab_drop` function calls for each row would be:

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
