The steps to draw the letter "V" with asterisks and convert it to an `ab_drop` function call sequence are as follows:

1.  Draw the letter "V" with asterisks:
```
    *       *
   * *     * *
  *   *   *   *
 *     * *     *
*       *       *
```

2.  Line-by-line, verbally list the asterisks and spaces generated in each row of the drawing:
```
Row 1: 1 asterisk, 6 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 2: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk, 2 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 3: 1 asterisk, 2 spaces, 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 4: 1 asterisk, 1 space, 1 asterisk, 6 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 5: 1 asterisk, 0 space, 1 asterisk, 6 spaces, 1 asterisk
```

3.  Replace asterisks with "x" and spaces with "y":
```
Row 1: 1x, 6y, 1x
Row 2: 1x, 4y, 1x, 2y, 1x
Row 3: 1x, 2y, 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 4: 1x, 1y, 1x, 6y, 1x
Row 5: 1x, 0y, 1x, 6y, 1x
```

4.  Write out each "x" and "y" side-by-side for each row:
```
Row 1: x6x
Row 2: x4x2x
Row 3: x2x4x
Row 4: x1x6x
Row 5: x0x6x
```

5.  Indicate the position of each variable in each row:
```
Row 1: x-1; y-2; x-3
Row 2: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; x-5
Row 3: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; x-5
Row 4: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; x-5
Row 5: x-1; y-2; x-3; y-4; x-5
```

6.  Convert the position information to a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```

So, the final `ab_drop` function call sequence is:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
