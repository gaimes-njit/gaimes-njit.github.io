To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` list.

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b13 block in the center of the bottom layer (layer 0) to form the base of the structure. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the block.

```
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```
(Note: The `W//2` gives the center slot of the structure.)

3. Next, drop two b31 blocks on top of the base, aligned with the left and right slots of the base. These blocks will form the sides of the "A" structure.

```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
ab_drop('b31', W-1)
```

4. Drop a b31 block on top of the previously dropped blocks, aligned with the center slot, to form the horizontal line of the "A" structure.

```
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

5. Finally, drop a b11 block on top of the horizontal line, aligned with the center slot, to complete the "A" structure.

```
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
```

After following these steps, the `structure` list will represent a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A".
