To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "J" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the `structure` variable.
2. Start by dropping a b31 block at the center slot (y = 10) using `ab_drop('b31', 10)`.
3. Drop a b11 block on top of the b31 block at slot 10 using `ab_drop('b11', 10)`.
4. Drop a b13 block at slot 11 using `ab_drop('b13', 11)`.
5. Drop a b13 block at slot 12 using `ab_drop('b13', 12)`.
6. Drop a b13 block at slot 13 using `ab_drop('b13', 13)`.

The resulting structure will resemble the letter "J" and satisfy all the given hard constraints.
