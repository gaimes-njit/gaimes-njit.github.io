To generate the shape resembling the letter "A", I will use the available props and the ab_drop() function. Here's the code:

```
# Map Initialization
field = []
for _ in range(16):
    field.append([0]*20)

# Drop b31 brick
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Check stability and collision
if field[3][5] != 0:
    ab_drop('b11', 8)
else:
    ab_drop('b11', 10)

# Drop b13 brick
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

Explanation:
1. I initialize the field as a 2D list with dimensions 16x20. Each cell will be represented by a numeric value, where 0 represents an empty cell and any other value represents an occupied cell.
2. I drop the b31 brick with an x_position of 9. This will occupy the cells (8, 0), (9, 0), and (10, 0).
3. I check if the cell (5, 3) (the pivot point) is occupied. If it is, I drop a b11 brick to the left of the pivot at x_position 8. Otherwise, I drop the b11 brick to the right of the pivot at x_position 10. This will occupy the cells (9, 1) or (11, 1) respectively.
4. I drop two b13 bricks at x_positions 8 and 10. These will occupy the cells (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2) and (10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 2).

This completes the generation of the shape resembling the letter "A" while satisfying the important notes of stability and avoiding boundary collisions.
