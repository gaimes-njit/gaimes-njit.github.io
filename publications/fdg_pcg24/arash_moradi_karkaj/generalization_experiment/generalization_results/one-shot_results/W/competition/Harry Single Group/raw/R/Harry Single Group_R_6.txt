To form the shape resembling the letter "R", we can start by placing a b13 brick vertically at the bottom-left corner of the field.

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

Now, let's add the horizontal part of the letter "R" using a b31 brick. We can place it on top of the vertical brick, making sure it remains stable.

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

To complete the shape, let's add another vertical part of the letter "R" using a b13 brick. We can place it to the right of the horizontal part, again making sure it remains stable.

```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

This will form the shape resembling the letter "R". The final code would look like:

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```
