To create the uppercase letter "E" using the given block types and environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a vertical block ('b13') at position (2,1).
2. Place a square block ('b11') at position (3,1).
3. Place a square block ('b11') at position (4,1).
4. Place a square block ('b11') at position (4,1).
5. Place a square block ('b11') at position (5,1).
6. Place a vertical block ('b13') at position (6,1).

Here's the stream of ab_drop commands to generate the letter "E":

```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b11',3)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',5)
ab_drop('b13',6)
```

By executing these commands consecutively, the letter "E" will be constructed within the allowed space boundaries while maintaining structural stability with gravity rules.
