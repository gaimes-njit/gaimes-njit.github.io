To create the uppercase letter "I" using the block types, follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 along the width:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Place a square block (b11) at position 3:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```
3. Place another square block (b11) at position 4:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```
4. Place another square block (b11) at position 4:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```
5. Place another square block (b11) at position 5:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
6. Finally, place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 6:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

The above commands will result in the formation of the uppercase letter "I" within the given Tetris-like environment.
