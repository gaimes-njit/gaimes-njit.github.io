To generate the uppercase letter "Q" using the given block types and gravity rules, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2:
````
ab_drop('b13',2)
````

2. Place a square block (b11) at position 3:
````
ab_drop('b11',3)
````

3. Place three square blocks (b11) consecutively at positions 4, 5, and 6:
````
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b11',5)
ab_drop('b11',6)
````

4. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at positions 4, 5, and 6 (covering the previously placed square blocks):
````
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b31',5)
ab_drop('b31',6)
````

5. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 6, overlapping the right side of the previously placed horizontal straight blocks:
````
ab_drop('b13',6)
````

After following these steps, you should have generated the uppercase letter "Q" using the given block types and gravity rules.
