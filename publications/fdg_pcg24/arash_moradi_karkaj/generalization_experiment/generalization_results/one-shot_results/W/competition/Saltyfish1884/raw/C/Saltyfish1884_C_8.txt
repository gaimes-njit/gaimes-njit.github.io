To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "C" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Define the goal structure that resembles the character "C". Since the width of the character "C" is 3 units and the height is 5 units, we can represent it as follows:
goal_structure = [
    ['C', 'C', ' '],
    ['C', ' ', ' '],
    ['C', ' ', ' '],
    ['C', ' ', ' '],
    ['C', 'C', ' ']
]

2. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

3. Determine the dropping position and order for each block to achieve stability and meet the constraints. 

- First, we need to drop a b13 block to serve as the base of the structure. We can drop it at slot 9 to ensure stability and weight distribution:
ab_drop('b13', 9)

- Next, we can drop a b31 block on top of the base. Since the block should be placed as low as possible, we can drop it at slot 8:
ab_drop('b31', 8)

- Now, we can drop two b11 blocks to form the upper part of the character "C". We can drop the first b11 block at slot 9 and the second one at slot 10:
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)

- Finally, we can drop another b11 block at slot 9 to form the lower part of the character "C":
ab_drop('b11', 9)

4. After following these steps, the final structure should resemble the character "C" while meeting all hard constraints. You can print the resulting structure by executing the following code:
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))

The output will be a representation of the structure formed by the dropped blocks, resembling the character "C" while satisfying the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.
