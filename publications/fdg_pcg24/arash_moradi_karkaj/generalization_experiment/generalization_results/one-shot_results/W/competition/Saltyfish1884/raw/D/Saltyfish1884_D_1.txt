To generate a stable structure resembling the character "D" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b13 block at the bottom-left corner of the structure to serve as the base:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

3. Place a b31 block on top of the base to form the vertical stem of the "D":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Place another b13 block on top of the stem to complete the vertical stroke of the "D":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

5. Place a b31 block horizontally above the vertical stroke to form the curve of the "D":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

6. Place a b13 block above the curve to close the loop and complete the structure:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "D" and meet all the given constraints. Note that the specific y-values used in the ab_drop() function calls may need to be adjusted to ensure stability and meet the boundary intrusion constraint.
