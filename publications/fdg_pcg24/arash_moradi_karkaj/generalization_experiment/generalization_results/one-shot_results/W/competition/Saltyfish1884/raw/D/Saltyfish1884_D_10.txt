To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "D" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base block (b11) at the bottom of the structure to create a solid base for stability. This can be done using the ab_drop() function with x = 'b11' and y = W//2.

```
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
```

3. Place two vertical blocks (b13) on top of the base block to form the vertical sides of the "D" character. These blocks should be placed on slots adjacent to the base block. We can use the ab_drop() function to drop each block individually at the appropriate slots.

```
ab_drop('b13', W//2 - 1)  # Left vertical block
ab_drop('b13', W//2 + 1)  # Right vertical block
```

4. Place a horizontal block (b31) on top of the two vertical blocks to form the top of the "D" character. This block should be centered horizontally and aligned with the top of the vertical blocks. We can use the ab_drop() function to drop this block at the appropriate slot.

```
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

5. (Optional) If there are remaining empty spaces above the top of the "D" character, fill them with b11 blocks to prevent the structure from being separated. We can use the ab_drop() function to drop these blocks individually at random empty slots.

```
# Calculate the number of empty slots above the top of the "D" character
empty_slots = sum([row.count(' ') for row in structure[:W]])

for _ in range(empty_slots):
    # Find a random empty slot and drop a b11 block
    random_slot = random.choice([i for i in range(W) if structure[0][i] == ' '])
    ab_drop('b11', random_slot)
```

6. Finally, we can print the resulting structure to visualize the generated "D" character.

```
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Note: This is just one possible solution to generate a structure resembling the character "D" while meeting the given constraints. The exact arrangement of blocks may vary depending on the specific implementation and random choices made.
