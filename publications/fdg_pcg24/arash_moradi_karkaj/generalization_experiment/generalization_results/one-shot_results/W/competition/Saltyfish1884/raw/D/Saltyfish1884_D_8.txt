To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "D" using the ab_drop() function and meeting all the hard constraints, follow these steps:

1) Define the shape of the structure: Based on the character "D," we need to use a b31 block for the base and then two b13 blocks on top to form the vertical lines of the character.

2) Start by dropping the b31 block on the base: Use the ab_drop() function to drop a b31 block at a suitable slot on the base layer (layer 0) to ensure stability. The center of the block should be aligned with the desired slot.

3) Drop the first b13 block on top of the b31 block: Use the ab_drop() function to drop a b13 block on a suitable slot above the b31 block. The center of the b13 block should be aligned with the desired slot.

4) Drop the second b13 block next to the first one: Use the ab_drop() function to drop another b13 block on a suitable slot next to the first b13 block. The center of the b13 block should be aligned with the desired slot.

5) Check stability and adjust if necessary: After each block is dropped, check if the structure is stable and make adjustments if necessary. If the structure becomes unstable, try adjusting the dropping positions and slots for the blocks until a stable structure is achieved.

6) Once the structure resembles the character "D" and meets all the hard constraints, the code should display the final result.

Sample code:

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the b31 block on the base
ab_drop('b31', 8) # Adjust the slot number (y) according to the desired position

# Drop the first b13 block on top of the b31 block
ab_drop('b13', 8) # Adjust the slot number (y) according to the desired position

# Drop the second b13 block next to the first one
ab_drop('b13', 11) # Adjust the slot number (y) according to the desired position

# Check stability and make adjustments if necessary

# Display the final result
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
