To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "J" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop a b31 block at slot 6 to form the left side of the "J" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```
This will result in the following structure:
```
     b31
     b31
     b31
```

Step 3: Drop a b11 block at slot 7 to form the bottom part of the "J" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```
This will result in the following structure:
```
     b31
     b31
     b31
        b11
```

Step 4: Drop a b13 block at slot 8 to complete the "J" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```
This will result in the following structure:
```
     b31
     b31
     b31
        b11
        b13
        b13
        b13
```

The final structure resembles the character "J" and meets all the hard constraints.
