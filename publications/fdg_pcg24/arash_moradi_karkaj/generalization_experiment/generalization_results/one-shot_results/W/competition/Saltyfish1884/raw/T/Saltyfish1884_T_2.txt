To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all the given constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks.

Let's break down the problem into steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid
We start by initializing the structure grid as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Determine the dropping positions and order
Based on the stability rules and the shape of the character "T," we can plan the dropping positions and order of the blocks as follows:

1) Drop a b11 block at slot 9 and layer 0 as the base.
2) Drop a b31 block at slot 8 and layer 1 above the base.
3) Drop a b13 block at slot 9 and layer 1 above the base.
4) Drop a b11 block at slot 9 and layer 2 above the base.

Step 3: Use the ab_drop() function to place the blocks in the determined positions
Using the provided ab_drop() function, we can place the blocks in the determined positions as follows:

ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop the b11 block at slot 9 and layer 0 as the base
ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Drop the b31 block at slot 8 and layer 1 above the base
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop the b13 block at slot 9 and layer 1 above the base
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop the b11 block at slot 9 and layer 2 above the base

Step 4: Resulting structure
The final structure grid after placing the blocks should resemble the character "T."

Here's the updated code with the new result:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the structure grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Determine the dropping positions and order
# (dropping positions and order in accordance with the steps above)

# Step 3: Use the ab_drop() function to place the blocks
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Step 4: Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all the given constraints.
