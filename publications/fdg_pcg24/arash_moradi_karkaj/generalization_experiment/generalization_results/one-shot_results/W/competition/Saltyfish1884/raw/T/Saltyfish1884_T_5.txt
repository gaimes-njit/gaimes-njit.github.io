To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T", we need to carefully consider the constraints and plan the placement of the blocks.

First, let's consider the stability constraint (5.1):
- A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs.
- Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing.
- The structure should not be separated.

Based on these rules, we can plan the structure as follows:
- Place a b31 block at the bottom layer, with its center aligned in the middle slot (y = W // 2).
- Place two b11 blocks on top of the b31 block, one on each side of the center slot. This will form the horizontal line of the "T".
- Place a b13 block on top of the b31 block, centered in the same slot as the b31 block. This will form the vertical line of the "T".

Now we can use the ab_drop() function to put the suitable blocks in the structure to form the desired shape:

```python
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
W = 20  # width of the map
H = 16  # height of the map
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Define the block types
b11 = 'b11'
b31 = 'b31'
b13 = 'b13'

# Function to drop a block on the structure
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# Drop the blocks to form the "T" structure
ab_drop(b31, W // 2)
ab_drop(b11, (W // 2) - 1)
ab_drop(b11, (W // 2) + 1)
ab_drop(b13, W // 2)

# Print the structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This code will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T" while meeting all the hard constraints. You can modify the code to generate a different structure by carefully considering the constraints and adjusting the placement of the blocks.
