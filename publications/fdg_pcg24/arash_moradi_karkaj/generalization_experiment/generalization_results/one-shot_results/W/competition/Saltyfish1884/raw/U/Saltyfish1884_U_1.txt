To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "U" and meets all the hard constraints, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with W slots and H layers.
2. Place a b31 block centered at the leftmost slot (slot 0) on the bottom layer (layer 0) using the ab_drop() function.
3. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block, centered at the leftmost slot, to create the left vertical part of the "U" shape.
4. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block, centered at the rightmost slot (slot 19), to create the right vertical part of the "U" shape.
5. Place a b31 block centered at the rightmost slot (slot 19) on the bottom layer to create the bottom part of the "U" shape.
6. Place a b11 block on top of the bottom b31 block, centered at the rightmost slot, to create the right bottom corner of the "U" shape.
7. Place a b13 block centered at the rightmost slot on the second layer (layer 1) to create the right vertical part of the "U" shape.
8. Place a b13 block centered at the leftmost slot on the second layer to create the left vertical part of the "U" shape.
9. Place a b13 block centered at the slot just to the right of the left vertical b13 block on the third layer (layer 2) to create the top horizontal part of the "U" shape.
10. Finally, place a b11 block on top of the top horizontal b13 block, centered at the slot just to the right of it, to create the top right corner of the "U" shape.

The resulting structure should resemble the character "U" and meet all the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is the example code to generate the structure:
```
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Place a b31 block centered at the leftmost slot (slot 0) on the bottom layer (layer 0)
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block, centered at the leftmost slot
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block, centered at the rightmost slot (slot 19)
ab_drop('b11', 19)

# Place a b31 block centered at the rightmost slot (slot 19) on the bottom layer
ab_drop('b31', 19)

# Place a b11 block on top of the bottom b31 block, centered at the rightmost slot
ab_drop('b11', 19)

# Place a b13 block centered at the rightmost slot on the second layer (layer 1)
ab_drop('b13', 19)

# Place a b13 block centered at the leftmost slot on the second layer
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Place a b13 block centered at the slot just to the right of the left vertical b13 block on the third layer (layer 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)

# Place a b11 block on top of the top horizontal b13 block, centered at the slot just to the right of it
ab_drop('b11', 2)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

The resulting structure, printed row by row, will resemble the character "U".
