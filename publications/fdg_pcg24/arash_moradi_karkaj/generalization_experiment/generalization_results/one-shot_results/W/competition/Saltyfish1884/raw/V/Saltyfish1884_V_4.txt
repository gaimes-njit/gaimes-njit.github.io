To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "V" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base block (b11 block) at the bottom center of the structure to provide a solid foundation for the V shape:
```python
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)
```

3. Place two b13 blocks vertically on top of the base block to form the two sides of the V shape. Choose the slots symmetrically from the left and right sides to ensure stability:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 - 2)
ab_drop('b13', W // 2 + 2)
```

4. Place a b31 block horizontally at the top of the structure, centered between the two b13 blocks, to complete the V shape:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```

5. The resulting structure should resemble the character "V", with the base block at the bottom and the two sides and middle formed by the b13 and b31 blocks.

6. To view the generated structure, you can print the content of the `structure` variable:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

Make sure to replace the contents of the `ab_drop()` function accordingly in your code to actually place the blocks on the structure.
