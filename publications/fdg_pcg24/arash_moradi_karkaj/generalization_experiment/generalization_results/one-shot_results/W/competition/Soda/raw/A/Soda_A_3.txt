To create the letter A using the block-stacking technique, we can start by placing the two side columns (b13) and then place the top bar (b31) on top of them. Here is the code to achieve this:

```
# Place the left side column
ab_drop("b13", 4)

# Place the right side column
ab_drop("b13", 14)

# Place the top bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This code will create a stable structure that resembles the letter A.
