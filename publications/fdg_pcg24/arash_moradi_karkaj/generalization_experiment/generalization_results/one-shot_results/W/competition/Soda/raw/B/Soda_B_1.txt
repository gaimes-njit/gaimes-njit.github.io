To build the structure that looks like the capital letter "B" (TARGET), we can break it down into several blocks and stack them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Place the base of the "B" structure
Since the "B" structure has a width of 3 blocks, we can start by placing a b31 block at the bottom-left corner of the grid.
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
```

Step 2: Place the middle section of the "B" structure
Next, we need to place a b31 block above the base block, centered horizontally. This will form the middle section of the "B" structure.
```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Step 3: Place the top section of the "B" structure
To complete the "B" structure, we need to place a b13 block above the middle section, centered horizontally. This will form the top section of the "B" structure.
```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

Step 4: Stability check and adjustments
After placing all the blocks, we need to ensure that the structure is stable and won't collapse due to gravity. If necessary, we can adjust the placement of the blocks slightly to improve stability. Here's an example of adjusting the position of the bottom block:
```
ab_drop("b31", 0.5)
```
This adjustment centers the bottom block better and increases stability.

Final Implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 0)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 0.5)
```

This implementation should generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "B" (TARGET) in the level, and it should be stable with no errors.
