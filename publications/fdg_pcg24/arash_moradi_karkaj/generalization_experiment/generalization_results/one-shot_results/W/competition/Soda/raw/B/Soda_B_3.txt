To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "B", we can break it down into two blocks - a square block for the top part and a column block for the bottom part. We will start by placing the square block at the center of the grid vertically and at an appropriate horizontal position.

Here is the first code block that drops the square block:

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Next, we will drop the column block below the square block. Since the column block has a size of 1 * 3, we need to find a position that allows it to fit under the square block without intruding on the boundary of the grid.

Here is the next code block that drops the column block:

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

By dropping these two blocks, we have created a structure that resembles the capital letter "B" in the natural orientation.

Please note that additional adjustments may be required to improve stability or similarity based on the evaluation of the resulting structure.
