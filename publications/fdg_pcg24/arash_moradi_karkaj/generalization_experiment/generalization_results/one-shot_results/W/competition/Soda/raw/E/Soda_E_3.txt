To create the letter E in the level, we can start by placing a row block in the bottom left corner. This will act as the base for the E shape. Then we can place a column block on top of the row block, centered at the middle of the grid. Finally, we can place another row block on top of the column block, centered at the middle of the grid.

Here is the complete implementation:

ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place the base row block at x_position=1
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place the column block on top, centered at x_position=9
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the top row block on top, centered at x_position=9
