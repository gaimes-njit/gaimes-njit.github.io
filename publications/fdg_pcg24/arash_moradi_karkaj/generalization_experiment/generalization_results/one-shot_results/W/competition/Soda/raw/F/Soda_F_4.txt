To create a structure in the shape of the capital letter "F" in the Tetris game, we can break it down into three blocks: a vertical pipe, a horizontal bar, and a smaller horizontal bar.

Here is the code to achieve this structure step by step, ensuring stability and similarity:

1. Drop the vertical pipe at the center of the grid:
ab_drop("b13", 9)

2. Drop the large horizontal bar connecting to the bottom of the vertical pipe:
ab_drop("b31", 9)

3. Drop the smaller horizontal bar connecting to the upper part of the vertical pipe:
ab_drop("b31", 8)

The complete implementation is as follows:

ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
