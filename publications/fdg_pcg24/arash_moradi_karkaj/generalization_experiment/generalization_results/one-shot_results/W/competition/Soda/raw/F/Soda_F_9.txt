To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "F", we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping the bottom bar of the letter "F". We can use the "b31" block type and place it at the center of the grid with x_position = 10.
2. Next, drop the vertical pipe of the letter "F". Again, we can use the "b31" block type and place it at x_position = 10.
3. Finally, drop the top bar of the letter "F". For this, we can use the "b13" block type and place it at x_position = 10.

The complete implementation code is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

This code will drop the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, creating a structure that looks like the capital letter "F".
