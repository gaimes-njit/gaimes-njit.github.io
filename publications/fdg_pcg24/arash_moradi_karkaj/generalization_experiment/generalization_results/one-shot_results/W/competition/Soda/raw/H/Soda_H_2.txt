First, we need to create the base of the letter "H". The base of the letter "H" consists of three blocks: two square blocks ("b11") on the sides and a row block ("b31") in the middle.

To create the base, we will drop the two square blocks first at the sides of the grid, and then drop the row block in the middle.

```
ab_drop("b11", 2)   # left square block
ab_drop("b11", 17)  # right square block
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # middle row block
```

Next, we need to create the vertical bars of the letter "H". The vertical bars consist of two column blocks ("b13") placed on top of the square blocks of the base.

To create the vertical bars, we will drop the column blocks on top of the square blocks at their respective positions.

```
ab_drop("b13", 2)   # left column block
ab_drop("b13", 17)  # right column block
```

Finally, we need to create the horizontal bar of the letter "H". The horizontal bar consists of a row block ("b31") placed above the vertical bars.

To create the horizontal bar, we will drop the row block on top of the column blocks at its position.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # horizontal row block
```

The complete implementation to create the letter "H" structure in the level while maintaining stability and similarity is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b11", 2)   # left square block
ab_drop("b11", 17)  # right square block
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # middle row block
ab_drop("b13", 2)   # left column block
ab_drop("b13", 17)  # right column block
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # horizontal row block
```
