First, we need to create the base of the "K" structure. We can achieve this by placing a row block ("b31") at the center of the bottom row (y=0) of the grid, at x_position=9 (center of the grid). 

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we need to add the vertical bar of the "K" structure. We can do this by placing a column block ("b13") at x_position=9 and y=1, which is just above the base row block.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Finally, we need to add the diagonal/angled part of the "K" structure. We can achieve this by placing another row block ("b31") at x_position=6 (left of the vertical bar) and y=2.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```
