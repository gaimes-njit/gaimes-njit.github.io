To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "N" (TARGET) in the level, we can follow the hints provided and build the structure in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability and similarity.

Step 1: Create the base
The base of the "N" character is formed by a row block (b31) placed in the middle of the level. We can drop this block at the center position in the first row.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 2: Create the vertical stroke
The vertical stroke of the "N" character is formed by a column block (b13) placed adjacent to the base. We can drop this block at the center position right next to the base.

```
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```

Step 3: Create the diagonal stroke
The diagonal stroke of the "N" character is formed by a row block (b31) placed diagonally above the vertical stroke. We can drop this block at the position just above the base, at the same horizontal position.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 4: Create the top connection
To complete the "N" character, we need to create a connection between the diagonal stroke and the vertical stroke. This can be done by placing a row block (b31) diagonally above the vertical stroke, starting from the top of the diagonal stroke. We can drop this block at the position above the diagonal stroke, at the same horizontal position.

```
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```

This completes the structure that looks like the capital letter "N" (TARGET) in the level.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 13)
```
