To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital character "Q" (TARGET), we can break it down into smaller blocks and stack them in a bottom-to-top fashion. Here is the step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Build the base of the "Q" shape using a row block (b31).
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Step 2: Add the vertical bar of the "Q" shape using a column block (b13).
```
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

Step 3: Add the curved part of the "Q" shape using two row blocks (b31).
```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 4: Add the middle bar of the "Q" shape using a column block (b13).
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Step 5: Add the top bar of the "Q" shape using a row block (b31).
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Complete Implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```
