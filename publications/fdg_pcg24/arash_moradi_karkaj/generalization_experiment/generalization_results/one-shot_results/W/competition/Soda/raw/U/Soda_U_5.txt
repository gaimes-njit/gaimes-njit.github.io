To build the capital letter "U" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can start by placing the base of the letter first. The base of the "U" will be formed by two row blocks (b31) placed horizontally. Let's place the blocks at the 7th and 12th columns:

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
```

Next, we can place the two vertical bars of the "U". These bars will be formed by two column blocks (b13) placed vertically. Let's place the blocks at the 2nd and 17th columns:

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 16)
```

Finally, we can place the horizontal bar of the "U". This bar will be formed by a row block (b31) placed horizontally. Let's place the block at the 7th column again, but this time on the second row:

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 16)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```
