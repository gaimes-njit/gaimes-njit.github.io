To build a structure that looks like the letter "W" in the Tetris game, we can approach it in the following steps:

Step 1: Build the base of the "W"
To create the base, we need two row blocks ("b31") placed horizontally next to each other. We will center them in the grid by dropping them at positions 9 and 10. 

ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

Step 2: Build the upper arms of the "W"
Next, we will add the upper arms of the "W". Each arm is made up of a column block ("b13") and a row block ("b31"). We will place them symmetrically on both sides of the base blocks.

ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 12)

Step 3: Build the center of the "W"
Finally, we will add the center block of the "W" using a square block ("b11"). We will place it just above the base blocks and centered between the upper arms.

ab_drop("b11", 9)

The complete implementation of the code to generate the "W" structure is as follows:

```
# Step 1: Build the base of the "W"
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 10)

# Step 2: Build the upper arms of the "W"
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 7)

ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 12)

# Step 3: Build the center of the "W"
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

By following these steps, the resulting structure will resemble the letter "W" and be stable under gravity.
