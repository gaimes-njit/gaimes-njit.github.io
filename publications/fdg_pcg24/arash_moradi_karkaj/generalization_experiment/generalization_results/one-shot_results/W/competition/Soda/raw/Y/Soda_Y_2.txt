To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Y" in the Tetris game, we can break it down into three blocks: a vertical column block in the middle, and two row blocks on either side. We can start by placing the vertical column block, and then place the row blocks on top of it.

The following is the complete implementation:

```
# Step 1: Place the vertical column block
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Step 2: Place the row blocks on either side
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

In this implementation, the first block placed is the vertical column block ("b13") centered at x_position=9. Then, the two row blocks ("b31") are placed on either side of the column block, centered at x_position=8 and x_position=10.

This implementation ensures stability as each block is well-supported by the blocks below it. It also creates a structure that resembles the letter "Y" when viewed in the natural orientation.
