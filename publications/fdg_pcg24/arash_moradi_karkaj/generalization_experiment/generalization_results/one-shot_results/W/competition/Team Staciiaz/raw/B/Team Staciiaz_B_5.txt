To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "B" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the given constraints, we need to carefully drop the blocks in a strategic order and position.

Here is the step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. Drop the first block (b13) at slot 4 (x_position=4) using `ab_drop('b13', 4)`. This block will form the left vertical part of the "B".

2. Drop the second block (b31) at slot 5 (x_position=5) using `ab_drop('b31', 5)`. This block will form the horizontal top part of the "B".

3. Drop the third block (b13) at slot 7 (x_position=7) using `ab_drop('b13', 7)`. This block will form the right vertical part of the "B".

After following these steps, the resulting structure will resemble the character "B" and meet the stability constraint. The blocks will not intrude on the boundary of the map as well.

Note: The specific positions and order of block dropping may vary depending on the exact weight and size of the blocks used in the implementation of the `ab_drop()` function. The above steps are a general guideline to generate the desired structure.
