To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a specific order and position.

To satisfy the stability constraint, we should start by dropping the bottom part of the F shape first. We can achieve this by dropping a b31 block at slot 0, aligning its center with the bottom layer. This will create a stable base for the rest of the structure to be built on.

Next, we need to drop the vertical part of the F shape. To meet the no boundary intrusion constraint, we can drop a b13 block at slot 0, aligning its center with the layer above the base. This will ensure that the vertical part of the F shape does not intrude on the boundary.

Finally, we can drop the top part of the F shape. We can drop a b31 block at slot 1, aligning its center with the layer above the vertical block. This will complete the structure and create the desired F shape.

The code implementation to generate this structure would be as follows:

```
# Step 1: Drop the bottom part of the F shape
ab_drop('b31', 0)

# Step 2: Drop the vertical part of the F shape
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Step 3: Drop the top part of the F shape
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` function calls will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and satisfies all the constraints.
