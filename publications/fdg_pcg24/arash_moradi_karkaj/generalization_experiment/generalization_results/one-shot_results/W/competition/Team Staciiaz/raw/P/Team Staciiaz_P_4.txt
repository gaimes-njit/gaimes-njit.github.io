To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "P" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we need to carefully consider the dropping position and order of the blocks. The following steps outline the process:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
   ```
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Determine the dropping positions and order for the blocks to form the shape of the character "P". Since stability is crucial, start by dropping the bottom-most blocks first, followed by the blocks above them.

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks at their respective positions. The dropping positions should be chosen in a way that ensures stability and does not intrude on the boundary of the map. For each block, specify its type (`'b11'`, `'b31'`, or `'b13'`) and the desired x-position (slot number) where its center should be aligned.

4. Repeat step 3 for all the blocks required to form the shape of the character "P". Adjust the dropping positions as necessary to achieve stability and ensure no boundary intrusion.

5. After dropping all the blocks, the final structure will resemble the character "P" and meet all the constraints.

Note: The precise dropping positions and order will depend on the specific requirements of the character "P" and the stability constraints. It may require some trial and error to find the optimal solution.
