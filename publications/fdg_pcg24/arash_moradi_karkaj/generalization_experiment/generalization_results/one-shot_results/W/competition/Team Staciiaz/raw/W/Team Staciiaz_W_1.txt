To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" using the `ab_drop()` function while satisfying all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Define the W and H slots for the map's width and height, respectively. These values are already given as W = 20 and H = 16.

3. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in the desired pattern to form the character "W". The drop positions and order are crucial to ensure stability and satisfying the constraints.

4. Plan the drop positions for each block type ('b11', 'b31', 'b13') to form the character "W":
   - Drop the 'b31' block at the center of the map, spanning slots 8, 9, and 10, starting from layer 10.
   - Drop the 'b11' block below the 'b31' block at slot 9, starting from layer 11.
   - Drop another 'b31' block above the 'b31' and 'b11' blocks at slots 8, 9, and 10, starting from layer 12.
   - Drop the 'b13' block below the top 'b31' block at slot 9, starting from layer 9.

5. Call the `ab_drop()` function with the appropriate parameters to drop each block type at the planned positions:
```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

6. The resulting structure should resemble the character "W" and meet all the constraints.

Here is the complete code to generate the stable "W" structure:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # Implementation of ab_drop function as provided

ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

By following these steps, the `ab_drop()` function can be used to generate a stable structure resembling the character "W" while satisfying all the constraints.
