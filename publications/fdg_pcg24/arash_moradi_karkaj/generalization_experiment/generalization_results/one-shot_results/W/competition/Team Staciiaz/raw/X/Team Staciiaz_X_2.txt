To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "X" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is an algorithm to achieve this:

1. Initialize the empty structure using the Map Initialization code provided.
2. Drop two vertical blocks (b13) at the center slots (slots 9 and 10) on the bottom layer (layer 0). These blocks will form the bottom part of the "X" structure.
    - Use the `ab_drop('b13', 9)` and `ab_drop('b13', 10)` functions.
3. Drop a horizontal block (b31) at the center of the row above the bottom layer (layer 1) and at the slots corresponding to the bottom vertical blocks' centers (slots 9 and 10). This block will connect the two vertical blocks.
    - Use the `ab_drop('b31', 9)` and `ab_drop('b31', 10)` functions.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the next 2 layers to create the middle part of the "X" structure.
5. Drop two vertical blocks (b13) at the center slots (slots 9 and 10) on the top layer (layer 15). These blocks will form the top part of the "X" structure.
    - Use the `ab_drop('b13', 9)` and `ab_drop('b13', 10)` functions.
6. Drop a horizontal block (b31) at the center of the row above the top layer (layer 14) and at the slots corresponding to the top vertical blocks' centers (slots 9 and 10). This block will connect the two vertical blocks.
    - Use the `ab_drop('b31', 9)` and `ab_drop('b31', 10)` functions.

By following this algorithm, we can create a stable structure that looks like the character "X" and meets all the constraints.
