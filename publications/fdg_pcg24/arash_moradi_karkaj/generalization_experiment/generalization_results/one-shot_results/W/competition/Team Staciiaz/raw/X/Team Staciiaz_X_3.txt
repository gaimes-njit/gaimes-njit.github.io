To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "X" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically place the blocks. Here's an approach to achieve this:

1. Start by initializing the structure grid using the given code snippet:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the bottom horizontal block (b31) such that its center is aligned with the middle slot (slot 9) by calling the `ab_drop()` function:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

3. Place the top vertical block (b13) above the horizontal block, centered on slots 8, 9, and 10:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

4. Place the remaining blocks to complete the structure. Start by placing the diagonal blocks from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, and then the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner:
```python
# Top-left to bottom-right diagonal blocks (b11)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Top-right to bottom-left diagonal blocks (b11)
ab_drop('b11', 11)
ab_drop('b11', 12)
ab_drop('b11', 13)
ab_drop('b11', 14)
ab_drop('b11', 15)
ab_drop('b11', 16)
ab_drop('b11', 17)
ab_drop('b11', 18)
```

Now, you will have a stable structure that resembles the character "X" and meets all the constraints. The placement of blocks ensures stability, as the weight is distributed symmetrically. The structure does not intrude on the boundary of the map, satisfying the no boundary intrusion constraint.
