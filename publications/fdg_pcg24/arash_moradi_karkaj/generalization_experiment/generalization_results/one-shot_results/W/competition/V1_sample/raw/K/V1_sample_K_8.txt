Here is the code snippet to generate a stable structure like the letter "K" using the 'ab drop()' function:

```python
from ansystulu import ab

# Function to drop blocks
def drop_block(block_type, layer, slot):
    ab.drop(block_type, layer, slot)

# Define the structure of the letter "K"
structure = [
    (0, 'b13'), (1, 'b31'), (1, 'b31'), (2, 'b13'),
    (4, 'b13'), (5, 'b13'), (6, 'b11'), (7, 'b13'),
    (9, 'b13'), (10, 'b13'), (11, 'b13'), (13, 'b13'),
    (14, 'b13')
]

# Drop blocks to build the letter "K" structure
for layer, block_type in structure:
    drop_block(block_type, 15, layer)

# Display the generated structure
ab.display()
```

This code will drop blocks of different types in the specified slots and layers to create a stable structure that looks like the letter "K". Adjust the structure list as needed to change the shape of the generated structure.
