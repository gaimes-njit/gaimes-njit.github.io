Step 2: Listing asterisks and spaces in each row of the letter "L" with asterisks:
Row 1: * 
Row 2: * 
Row 3: * 
Row 4: * 
Row 5: * * * 

Step 3: Replacing asterisks with "x" and spaces with "y" in each row of the letter "L":
Row 1: x 
Row 2: x 
Row 3: x 
Row 4: x 
Row 5: x x x 

Step 4: Writing out "x" and "y" for each row:
Row 1: x 
Row 2: x 
Row 3: x 
Row 4: x 
Row 5: x x x 

Step 5: Indicating the position of each variable:
Row 1: x-1 
Row 2: x-1 
Row 3: x-1 
Row 4: x-1 
Row 5: x-1; x-3; x-5 

Step 6: Returning a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row:
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
