1. Here is the drawing of the letter "Q" with asterisks:
```
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****
  *
```

2. Line-by-line list of asterisks and spaces generated in each row:
- 1st Row: 5 asterisks
- 2nd Row: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
- 3rd Row: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
- 4th Row: 1 asterisk, 3 spaces, 1 asterisk
- 5th Row: 5 asterisks
- 6th Row: 2 spaces, 1 asterisk

3. Using "x" for asterisks and "y" for spaces, the new representation becomes:
- 1st Row: 5x
- 2nd Row: 1x, 3y, 1x
- 3rd Row: 1x, 3y, 1x
- 4th Row: 1x, 3y, 1x
- 5th Row: 5x
- 6th Row: 2y, 1x

4. Writing out each x and y for each row:
- 1st Row: xxxxx
- 2nd Row: xyyyx
- 3rd Row: xyyyx
- 4th Row: xyyyx
- 5th Row: xxxxx
- 6th Row: yyyx

5. Indicating the position of each variable:
- 1st Row: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
- 2nd Row: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; x-5
- 3rd Row: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; x-5
- 4th Row: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; x-5
- 5th Row: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
- 6th Row: y-1; y-2; y-3; x-4

6. Sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)ab_drop("b11", 2)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 4)ab_drop("b11", 5)ab_drop("b11", 2)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 1)ab_drop("b11", 2)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 4)ab_drop("b11", 5)ab_drop("b11", 2)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 3)
```
