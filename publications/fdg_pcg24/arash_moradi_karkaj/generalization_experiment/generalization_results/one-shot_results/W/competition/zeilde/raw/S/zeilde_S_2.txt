Step 2:
The letter "S" with asterisks is represented as follows:

*****
*     
***** 
    *
*****

Line-by-line, the asterisks and spaces generated in each row are as follows:
- Row 1: 5 asterisks, 0 spaces
- Row 2: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces
- Row 3: 5 asterisks, 0 spaces
- Row 4: 3 spaces, 1 asterisk, 3 spaces
- Row 5: 5 asterisks, 0 spaces

Step 3:
Replacing asterisks with "x" and spaces with "y" in each row, we have:
- Row 1: "xxxxx"
- Row 2: "xyyyy"
- Row 3: "xxxxx"
- Row 4: "yyyxyyy"
- Row 5: "xxxxx"

Step 4:
Writing out each "x" and "y" side-by-side for each row, we get:
- Row 1: "x5" (5 "x")
- Row 2: "x1y4" (1 "x", 4 "y")
- Row 3: "x5" (5 "x")
- Row 4: "y3x1y3" (3 "y", 1 "x", 3 "y")
- Row 5: "x5" (5 "x")

Step 5:
Indicating the position of each variable, we have:
- Row 1: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5"
- Row 2: "x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; y-5"
- Row 3: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5"
- Row 4: "y-1; y-2; y-3; x-4; y-5; y-6; y-7"
- Row 5: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5"

Step 6:
Returning a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
