To create the structure resembling "R" using the `ab_drop()` function and satisfying all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure using the given code:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Drop the first block, which is a vertical block (b13), at the center of the structure:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

3. Drop the second block, which is a horizontal block (b31), slightly shifted to the left of the center:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 8)
   ```

4. Drop the third block, which is a horizontal block (b31), aligned with the first block:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 10)
   ```

5. Drop the fourth block, which is a vertical block (b13), slightly shifted to the right of the center:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 11)
   ```

6. Drop the fifth block, which is a horizontal block (b31), aligned with the fourth block:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 12)
   ```

The complete code block for generating the structure resembling "R" would be:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```
