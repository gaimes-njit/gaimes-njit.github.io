To use the ab_drop() function to generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "B," you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Use the ab_drop() function to drop the blocks in the desired order and positions, taking into account stability and the shape of the letter "B." The exact positioning and order of the drops will depend on your specific solution approach.

Here is an example of how you can use the ab_drop() function to create a stable "B" structure with the given constraints:

```python
# Drop the bottom part of the "B" shape
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the middle part of the "B" shape
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Drop the top part of the "B" shape
ab_drop('b31', 11)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b13', 12)

# Resulting structure will resemble the uppercase letter "B"
```

Note: This is just one possible arrangement of the blocks to form the letter "B." There can be multiple valid solutions that meet the constraints. The specific arrangement will depend on the approach and strategy you choose to solve the block-stacking problem.
