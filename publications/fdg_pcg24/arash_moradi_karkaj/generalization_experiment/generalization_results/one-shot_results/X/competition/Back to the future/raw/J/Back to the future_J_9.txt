To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "J" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Next, we will drop the b13 block at the bottom left corner of the grid to form the vertical part of the "J" shape. We can do this by calling the `ab_drop()` function like this:
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```
This will drop the b13 block at slot 1, aligning its center.

3. After dropping the b13 block, we will drop the b31 block above it to form the horizontal part of the "J" shape. To ensure stability, we need to drop it at slot 1 or 2, aligning its center. We can choose randomly between these two slots. The code will look like this:
```
import random

slot = random.randint(1, 2)
ab_drop('b31', slot)
```

4. Finally, we can drop the b11 block above the b31 block to complete the "J" shape. We will drop it at the same slot as the b31 block to ensure stability. The code will look like this:
```
ab_drop('b11', slot)
```

By following these steps, we will generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "J" and meets all the hard constraints.
