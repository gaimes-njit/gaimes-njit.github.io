To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase letter "M" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start building the structure from the bottom layer (layer 0) to the top layer (layer 15) using the `ab_drop()` function. Place each block type (b11, b13, b31) at the appropriate slot to ensure stability and meet the goal.

3. Follow the block-stacking problem techniques to determine the dropping position and order. Move from left to right to fill the slots and ensure stability at each step.

4. Place the blocks for the letter "M" in the following pattern:
```
   b31      b31
   b13  b11  b13
```

5. Check the stability of the structure after each block placement to ensure it does not collapse. Use the condition `if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ': break` in the `ab_drop()` function to detect if a block is already present below the current position.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 as necessary to build the entire structure and meet the goal.

7. Record the coordinates of each `ab_drop()` call to list the coordinates of the block placements.

8. Ensure that the generated structure is diverse and not always the same by varying the order of block placement and positions.

It is important to note that the code to generate the structure will depend on the specific implementation of the system, including any additional functions, data structures, or algorithms used.
