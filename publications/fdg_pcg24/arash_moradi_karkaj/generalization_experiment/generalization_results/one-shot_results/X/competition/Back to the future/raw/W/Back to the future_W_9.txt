To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "W" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at the center slot (y = W // 2) using the `ab_drop()` function.
```python
ab_drop('b13', W // 2)
```
This will form the middle vertical line of the "W".

3. Drop two b31 blocks on either side of the b13 block to form the top sloping lines of the "W". Calculate the slot numbers for dropping these blocks based on the position of the b13 block.
```python
ab_drop('b31', (W // 2) - 1)  # Drop left b31 block
ab_drop('b31', (W // 2) + 1)  # Drop right b31 block
```

4. Drop two b11 blocks above the b31 blocks to complete the top part of the "W".
```python
ab_drop('b11', (W // 2) - 1)  # Drop left b11 block
ab_drop('b11', (W // 2) + 1)  # Drop right b11 block
```

5. Create a support structure for the bottom part of the "W" by dropping a b31 block on top of the existing b13 block.
```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)  # Drop bottom b31 block
```

6. Drop two b11 blocks on either side of the bottom b31 block to form the bottom sloping lines of the "W". Calculate the slot numbers for dropping these blocks based on the position of the bottom b31 block.
```python
ab_drop('b11', (W // 2) - 1)  # Drop left b11 block
ab_drop('b11', (W // 2) + 1)  # Drop right b11 block
```

7. Finally, drop a b11 block on top of the existing b31 block to complete the bottom part of the "W".
```python
ab_drop('b11', W // 2)  # Drop center b11 block
```

By following these steps, you will generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "W" and meets all the hard constraints. Remember to check for stability after each block drop and adjust the coordinates accordingly.
