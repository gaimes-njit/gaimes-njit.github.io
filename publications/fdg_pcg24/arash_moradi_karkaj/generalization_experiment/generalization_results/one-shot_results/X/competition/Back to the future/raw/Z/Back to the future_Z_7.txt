To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Z" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b31 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and at slot 0 to provide a stable base:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Drop the b13 block above the base block at slot 0 to support the b31 block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Drop the b11 block above the b13 block at slot 0 to complete the first vertical line of the "Z":
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

5. Drop the b31 block next to the first line at slot 1 to create the top horizontal line of the "Z":
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

6. Drop the b11 block above the top horizontal line at slot 1 to complete the diagonal line of the "Z":
```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to create the lower horizontal line of the "Z" and complete the structure:
```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
```

After executing these steps, the `structure` grid will contain a stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "Z" and meets all the hard constraints.

Note: The exact coordinates of each `ab_drop()` call may vary depending on the specific implementation and adjustments made to meet the constraints.
