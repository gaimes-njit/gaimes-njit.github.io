# The generated code creates a structure that looks like the capital English letter "O". It uses the given block types 'b11', 'b31', and 'b13' to drop blocks at specific positions in order to form the desired shape. The structure is formed from the bottom layer upwards, ensuring stability and weight distribution. The code avoids exceeding the map boundary and follows the constraints given in the prompt. The resulting code does not contain any loops or recursion.
