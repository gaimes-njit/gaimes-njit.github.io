To form a shape resembling the letter "G" using the available bricks and the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the field with all cells as empty.

2. Generate and drop the b13 brick at x_position = 5, using the ab_drop('b13', 5) function. This will occupy cells (5, 0), (5, 1), and (5, 2).

3. Generate and drop the b31 brick at x_position = 6, using the ab_drop('b31', 6) function. This will occupy cells (5, 3), (6, 3), and (7, 3).

By following these steps, we will have formed a shape resembling the letter "G" on the field while satisfying the stability and boundary collision requirements.

Here is the code to generate the required structure:

```python
# Initialize the field
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check stability of the bricks
def is_stable(field):
    for y in range(1, 16):
        for x in range(1, 19):
            if field[y][x] != 0:
                if (field[y][x-1] != 0 and field[y][x] != field[y][x-1]) or (field[y][x+1] != 0 and field[y][x] != field[y][x+1]):
                    return False
    return True

# Function to check boundary collision
def is_colliding(field, brick, x_position):
    for x in range(x_position, x_position + brick['width']):
        if x < 0 or x >= 20 or field[0][x] != 0:
            return True
    return False

# Function to drop brick on the field
def ab_drop(x, y):
    brick = {}
    if x == 'b31':
        brick = {'width': 3, 'height': 1}
    elif x == 'b13':
        brick = {'width': 1, 'height': 3}
    elif x == 'b11':
        brick = {'width': 1, 'height': 1}
    
    if not is_colliding(field, brick, y):
        for i in range(brick['width']):
            field[0][y + i] = 1             # Occupying the cells on the ground
            for j in range(1, 16):
                if field[j][y + i] != 0:    # Stopping the brick when an occupied cell is detected
                    return
                if i == 0:
                    field[j][y + i] = 1     # Occupying the cells during the descent

# Generate the required structure
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)

# Print the final field
for row in field[::-1]:
    print(row)
```

The output will be:
```
