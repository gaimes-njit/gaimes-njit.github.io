To create the structure "L" inside a 20*16 box, you can use the following commands:

1. Drop a 1*3 block (b13) starting from position (0, 0):
ab_drop('b13', 0)

2. Drop a 3*1 block (b31) starting from position (0, 3):
ab_drop('b31', 0)

Now, you will have the "L" shape structure inside the 20*16 box.
