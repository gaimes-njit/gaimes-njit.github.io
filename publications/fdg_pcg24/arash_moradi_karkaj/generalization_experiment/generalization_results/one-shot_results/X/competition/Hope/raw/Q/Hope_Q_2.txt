To create the structure "Q" using only the ab_drop('blocktype', x position) command, within a 20*16 box, you can follow these steps:

1. Drop the top horizontal line of the "Q" using a 1*3 block (b13) starting at position (0, 0). To do this, use the command: ab_drop('b13', 0)

2. Drop the vertical line of the "Q" using a 3*1 block (b31) starting at position (0, 2). To do this, use the command: ab_drop('b31', 2)

3. Drop the bottom horizontal line of the "Q" using a 1*3 block (b13) starting at position (0, 4). To do this, use the command: ab_drop('b13', 4)

Here's how the final structure will look like:

```
bb
bb
bb
b
b
bbb
```

Note: Each "b" represents a block placed using the ab_drop('blocktype', x position) command. The "Q" structure has a width of 2 blocks and a height of 6 blocks.
