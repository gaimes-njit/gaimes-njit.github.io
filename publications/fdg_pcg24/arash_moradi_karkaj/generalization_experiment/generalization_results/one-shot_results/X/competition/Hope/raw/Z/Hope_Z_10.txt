To create the structure of the letter "Z" inside a 20*16 box, you would need to use the ab_drop('blocktype', x position) command with the following coordinates:

1. Place a b13 block at position (0,0):
   ab_drop('b13', 0)

2. Place a b11 block at position (2,0):
   ab_drop('b11', 2)

3. Place a b13 block at position (3,1):
   ab_drop('b13', 3)

4. Place a b31 block at position (6,2):
   ab_drop('b31', 6)

5. Place a b13 block at position (9,3):
   ab_drop('b13', 9)

6. Place a b11 block at position (11,3):
   ab_drop('b11', 11)

Note: The x position denotes the starting column of each block within the 20*16 box. The blocks will automatically drop vertically from top to bottom and fill in the designated area.
