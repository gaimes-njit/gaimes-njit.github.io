To create a structure like "Z" inside a 20*16 box using the given block types and the ab_drop command, you can follow these steps:

1. Create the first horizontal line of the "Z" shape using a b13 block type. Starting from position (0,0), use the ab_drop command to drop the block at position (0,0). This will create a horizontal line of length 3.

```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

2. Next, create the vertical line of the "Z" shape using a b31 block type. Starting from position (2,2), use the ab_drop command to drop the block at position (2,2). This will create a vertical line of length 3.

```
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
```

3. Finally, create the second horizontal line of the "Z" shape using a b13 block type. Starting from position (4,0), use the ab_drop command to drop the block at position (4,0). This will create a horizontal line of length 3.

```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

This will create a "Z" shape inside the 20*16 box exactly as required.
