Here is an example stream of commands that will generate the uppercase English letter "A" in the defined environment:

```
ab_drop('b11',5)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b31',7)
ab_drop('b11',5)
ab_drop('b11',4)
ab_drop('b13',5)
ab_drop('b13',3)
ab_drop('b13',7)
```

Please note that this is just one possible solution. There may be other valid sequences of commands that can generate the letter "A" as well.
