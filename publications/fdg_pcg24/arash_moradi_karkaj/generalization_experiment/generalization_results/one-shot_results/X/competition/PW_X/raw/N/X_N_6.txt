Based on the given instructions, here is a stream of commands that generates the uppercase English letter "N":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b13',7)
ab_drop('b31',11)
ab_drop('b31',14)
```

This sequence of commands constructs the letter "N" by placing blocks in the specified positions within the allowed space. It starts with a horizontal block at the first position, followed by two vertical blocks at positions 4 and 7, and ends with two horizontal blocks at positions 11 and 14.
