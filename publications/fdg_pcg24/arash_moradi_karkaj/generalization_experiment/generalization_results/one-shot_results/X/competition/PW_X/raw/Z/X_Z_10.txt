To generate the uppercase English letter "Z", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "Z" within the allowed space and with structural stability based on the gravity rules.
