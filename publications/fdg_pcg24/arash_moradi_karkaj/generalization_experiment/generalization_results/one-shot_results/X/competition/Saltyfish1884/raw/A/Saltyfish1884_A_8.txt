To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "A" using the ab_drop() function while meeting all hard constraints, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid with W slots and H layers:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Place the bottom block (b11) on the stable base (layer 0):
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 9)
   ```

3. Place the left and right base blocks (b11) for the "A" shape on layers 1 and 2:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b11', 8)
   ab_drop('b11', 10)
   ```

4. Place the horizontal block (b31) on the middle layer (layer 3):
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

5. Place the top vertical block (b13) on the top layer (layer 4):
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the remaining layers (5-15) to complete the "A" shape:
   ```python
   # Layers 5-7
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   
   # Layers 8-10
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   
   # Layers 11-13
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   
   # Layers 14-15
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

7. The final structure will resemble the character "A" and meet all stability and boundary constraints.

Note: The exact slot and layer positions may vary based on the specific requirements and desired appearance of the "A" structure. Adjust the coordinates accordingly to achieve the desired result.
