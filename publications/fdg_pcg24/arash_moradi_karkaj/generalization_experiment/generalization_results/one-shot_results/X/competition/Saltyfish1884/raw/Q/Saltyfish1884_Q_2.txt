To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Q", we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
W = 20  # width of the map
H = 16  # height of the map
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]  # empty WxH grid
```

Step 2: Place the solid base for stability:
```python
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop('b11', i)
```

Step 3: Place the vertical block on the left side:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal block on top of the vertical block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This will create a structure that resembles the character "Q" while satisfying the stability constraints.

Note: The specific slots and layers used above are just an example. You can adjust them according to your desired placement.
