To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "S" using the ab_drop() function and meet all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Determine the dropping position and order for each block.

For the "S" character, we can start by dropping the first b31 block on the base (layer 0) at a suitable slot position to form the bottom part of the structure. Let's choose slot 8 as the center slot for the b31 block.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Next, we can drop another b31 block slightly above the first one, at slot 9. This will create an overhang on the right side of the structure.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Now, we need to drop b13 blocks on the left and right sides of the structure to provide stability and prevent the overhang from collapsing. We can choose slot 7 for the left b13 block and slot 10 for the right b13 block.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
```

Step 3: Adjust the dropping positions of the blocks to meet the stability constraint.

To reduce the risk of collapsing, we can drop two b11 blocks on the base below the b31 blocks. Let's choose slot 6 for the left b11 block and slot 11 for the right b11 block.

```python
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 11)
```

Step 4: Check and adjust the dropping positions to meet the stability constraint.

To ensure that the structure is not separated, we need to fill the gaps between the blocks on the base. We can use b11 blocks to fill the spaces between the b13 blocks and b31 blocks.

```python
ab_drop("b11", 8)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Step 5: Check if the structure meets the no boundary intrusion constraint.

By following the above steps, the structure should not intrude on the map's boundary, as we have aligned the blocks properly within the available slots.

Step 6: Print the final structure.

```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The output should be a stable structure resembling the character "S" and meeting all the given requirements.
