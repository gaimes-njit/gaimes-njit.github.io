To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "W" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.

```python
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers

structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the first block (b31) to form the base of the structure.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Drop b31 at slot 9
```

Step 3: Drop the second block (b13) to the left of the base.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Drop b13 at slot 5
```

Step 4: Drop the third block (b13) to the right of the base.

```python
ab_drop("b13", 13)  # Drop b13 at slot 13
```

Step 5: Drop the fourth block (b31) on top of the base, aligned with the left b13.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 7)  # Drop b31 at slot 7
```

Step 6: Drop the fifth block (b31) on top of the base, aligned with the right b13.

```python
ab_drop("b31", 11)  # Drop b31 at slot 11
```

Step 7: Drop the sixth block (b11) on top of the structure, aligned with the middle slot.

```python
ab_drop("b11", 10)  # Drop b11 at slot 10
```

The resulting structure should resemble the character "W" and meet all hard constraints.

Note: The specific positions and order of block placement may vary depending on the starting conditions and the desired shape of the structure. Adjustments can be made to the slot numbers and block types to achieve different variations of the "W" structure.
