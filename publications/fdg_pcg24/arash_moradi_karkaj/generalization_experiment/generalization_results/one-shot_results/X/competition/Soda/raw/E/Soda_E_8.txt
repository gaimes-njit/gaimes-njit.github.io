First, we will start by creating the base of the "E" by dropping a "b31" block centered at x_position=9.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we will create the top bar of the "E" by dropping a "b11" block centered at x_position=9.

```
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

Finally, we will create the middle bar of the "E" by dropping a "b13" block centered at x_position=9.

```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```
