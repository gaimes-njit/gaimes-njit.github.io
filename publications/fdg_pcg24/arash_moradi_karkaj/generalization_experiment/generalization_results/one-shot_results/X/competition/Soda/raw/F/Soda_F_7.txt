To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "F", we can break it down into three blocks: two blocks that form the vertical pipe and one block that forms the horizontal bar at the top.

First, let's place the two blocks for the vertical pipe:

```
# Place the top block of the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# Place the bottom block of the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b11", 10)
```

Next, let's place the block for the horizontal bar at the top:

```
# Place the block for the horizontal bar at the top
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```

This completes the structure in the shape of the capital letter "F". The blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability. The resulting structure should look similar to the target shape when evaluated.

Complete implementation:

```
# Place the top block of the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b11", 9)

# Place the bottom block of the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b11", 10)

# Place the block for the horizontal bar at the top
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```
