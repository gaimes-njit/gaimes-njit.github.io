To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital character "I", we can start by placing a row block (b31) at the center of the level. This will form the base of the "I". 

Then, we can place a column block (b13) on top of the row block, centered at the same x-position. This will create the vertical part of the "I". 

Finally, we can place another row block (b31) on top of the column block, centered at the same x-position. This will complete the "I" shape.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

By following this sequence of ab_drop calls, we can generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital character "I" with the best stability and similarity.
