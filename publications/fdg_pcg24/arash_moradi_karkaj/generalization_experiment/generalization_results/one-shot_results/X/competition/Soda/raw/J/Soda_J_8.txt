To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "J", we can break it down into three blocks - a top bar, a middle pipe, and the bottom tick. 

First, we need to drop the top bar. We can place it at x_position=9 to center it in the middle. 

Next, we need to drop the middle pipe. Since it is a column block, we can place it at x_position=10. 

Finally, we need to drop the bottom tick. We can place it at x_position=9 to align it with the top bar.

The complete implementation to generate a structure resembling the letter "J" is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Drop the top bar
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Drop the middle pipe
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Drop the bottom tick
```
