To create the letter K, we can break it down into three blocks: two column blocks for the vertical lines and a row block for the connecting horizontal line.

First, we can drop the left column block at position 5. This will occupy cells (4, 0), (5, 0), and (6, 0).

Next, we drop the right column block at position 8. This will occupy cells (7, 0), (8, 0), and (9, 0).

Finally, we drop the row block at position 7. This will occupy cells (6, 1), (7, 1), and (8, 1).

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
```
