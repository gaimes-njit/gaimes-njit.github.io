To create a structure that looks like the letter "L" in the level, we can follow the given hints and build the structure in a bottom-to-top fashion. 

First, we will create the bottom bar of the "L" by dropping a row block (`b31`) at the center of the grid. This will form the base of the structure.

Next, we will create the vertical pipe of the "L" by dropping a column block (`b13`) on top of the bottom bar. We will position the column block in such a way that it is centered above the bottom bar.

Finally, we will drop a square block (`b11`) on top of the vertical pipe to complete the "L" shape. We will position the square block in such a way that it is centered above the vertical pipe.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Bottom bar
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Vertical pipe
ab_drop("b11", 9)  # Square block
```

This implementation follows the given constraints and creates a stable structure that resembles the letter "L" in the level.
