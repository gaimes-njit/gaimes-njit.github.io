First, let's create the base structure of the letter "P" using the bottom bar and the middle pipe blocks. We will place them in the correct positions to form the base of the letter.

```python
# Place the bottom bar block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
# Place the middle pipe block
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Next, we will add the top bar block to complete the letter "P".

```python
# Place the top bar block
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Finally, we will evaluate the stability and similarity of the structure.

```python
# Evaluate stability and similarity
# TODO: Implement stability evaluation and similarity comparison
```

Note: The stability evaluation and similarity comparison are not provided in the response and need to be implemented separately.
