To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "V" in the level, we can use the following steps:

1. Drop the base blocks (row block) at the bottom to form the base of the "V". Place the row block at the center of the grid.
2. Drop the top blocks (column blocks) above the base blocks to form the two sides of the "V". Place each column block at the center of the grid, one on the left and one on the right.

Here's the complete implementation to generate the "V" structure:

ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Drop the row block at the bottom-center
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Drop the column block on the left
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Drop the column block on the right
