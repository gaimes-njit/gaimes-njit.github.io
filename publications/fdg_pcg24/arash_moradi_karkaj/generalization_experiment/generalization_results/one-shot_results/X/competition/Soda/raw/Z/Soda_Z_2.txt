To generate a structure that looks like the letter Z, we can follow the instructions given in the hints. 

First, we need to create the vertical pipe of the Z shape. We can do this by dropping a column block ("b13") at x_position=9. This will create a stable vertical column.

Next, we need to create the horizontal bar of the Z shape. We can do this by dropping a row block ("b31") at x_position=7. This will create a stable horizontal bar.

Finally, we need to create the diagonal bar of the Z shape. We can do this by dropping a column block ("b13") at x_position=5. This will create a stable diagonal column.

The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # creates the vertical pipe of the Z shape
ab_drop("b31", 7)  # creates the horizontal bar of the Z shape
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # creates the diagonal bar of the Z shape
```

This implementation will generate a structure that looks like the letter Z and is stable, meeting both the stability and similarity requirements.
