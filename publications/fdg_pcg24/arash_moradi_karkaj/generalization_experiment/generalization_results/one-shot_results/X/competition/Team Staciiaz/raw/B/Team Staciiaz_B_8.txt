To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "B" while meeting all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop blocks in a certain order and position.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Start by dropping a horizontal block (`b31`) at slot 3 using the `ab_drop('b31', 3)` function. This will form the top curve of the "B".

2. Next, drop a vertical block (`b13`) at slot 3 using the `ab_drop('b13', 3)` function. This will form the vertical line of the "B".

3. Drop another horizontal block (`b31`) at slot 3 using the `ab_drop('b31', 3)` function. This will form the bottom curve of the "B".

4. Finally, drop a square block (`b11`) at slot 7 using the `ab_drop('b11', 7)` function. This will complete the structure and form the center of the "B".

With these steps, the resulting structure will resemble the character "B" and meet all the constraints, including stability and no boundary intrusion.

Note: The specific slot numbers and block types used in the example above can be adjusted based on the initial position of the blocks and desired final structure shape.
