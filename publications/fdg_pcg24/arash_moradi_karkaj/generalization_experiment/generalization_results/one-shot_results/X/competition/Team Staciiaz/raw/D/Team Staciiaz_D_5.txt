To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "D" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the positions to drop the blocks:
- Determine the x position for each block based on the shape of the "D" character.
- Calculate the y position for each block based on the stability constraint and the position of previously dropped blocks.

2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks:
- Use the calculated positions for each block to call the `ab_drop()` function and drop the blocks in the structure.

Here is an example implementation:

```python
# Step 1: Calculate block positions
b11_positions = [
    (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10),
    (5, 2), (5, 10),
    (6, 2), (6, 10),
    (7, 2), (7, 10),
    (8, 2), (8, 10),
]
b13_positions = [
    (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1),
    (3, 11), (2, 11), (1, 11), (0, 11),
]
b31_positions = [
    (9, 2), (10, 2), (11, 2), (12, 2), (13, 2), (14, 2), (15, 2), (16, 2), (17, 2),
    (9, 10), (10, 10), (11, 10), (12, 10), (13, 10), (14, 10), (15, 10), (16, 10), (17, 10),
]

# Step 2: Drop the blocks
for x, y in b11_positions:
    ab_drop('b11', x)
for x, y in b13_positions:
    ab_drop('b13', x)
for x, y in b31_positions:
    ab_drop('b31', x)
```

After executing the code, the `structure` variable will contain a stable structure that looks like the character "D" and meets all the given constraints.
