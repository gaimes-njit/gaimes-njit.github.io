To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "E", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided `structure` variable.
2. Start by dropping the b31 block at slot 2 using the `ab_drop()` function: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.
3. Drop the b31 block at slot 2 on the layer above the previous block: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.
4. Drop the b11 block at slot 2 on the layer above the previous block: `ab_drop('b11', 2)`.
5. Drop the b11 block at slot 1 on the layer above the previous block: `ab_drop('b11', 1)`.
6. Drop the b31 block at slot 2 on the layer above the previous block: `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.
7. Drop the b11 block at slot 2 on the layer above the previous block: `ab_drop('b11', 2)`.

This sequence of block drops will result in a stable structure that looks like the character "E" and satisfies all the constraints.
