To generate a stable structure resembling the character "I" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully drop blocks in a specific order and position to satisfy the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

Here is a step-by-step solution to create the "I" structure:

Step 1: Drop the base block (b31) in the middle slot (slot 9) at layer 0 to form the base of the structure.
`ab_drop('b31', 9)`

Step 2: Drop the vertical blocks (b13) on top of the base block in slots 8, 9, and 10 at layer 1 to create the middle part of the structure.
`ab_drop('b13', 8)`
`ab_drop('b13', 9)`
`ab_drop('b13', 10)`

Step 3: Drop the top horizontal block (b31) in slots 8, 9, and 10 at layer 2 to form the top part of the structure.
`ab_drop('b31', 8)`
`ab_drop('b31', 9)`
`ab_drop('b31', 10)`

The resulting structure will resemble the character "I" with stable blocks and no boundary intrusion.

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

ab_drop('b31', 9)

ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)

ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

Note: The exact positions and order of dropping the blocks may vary, as long as the stability and boundary intrusion constraints are met. The solution provided above is just one possible solution.
