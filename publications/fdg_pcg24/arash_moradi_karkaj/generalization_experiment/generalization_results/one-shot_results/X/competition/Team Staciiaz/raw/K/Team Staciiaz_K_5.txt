To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "K" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is the step-by-step process to achieve the goal:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop a `b31` block at slot 8 to create the vertical line of the "K" character:
```
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

3. Drop a `b11` block at slot 9 and layer 7 to create the diagonal line of the "K" character:
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

4. Drop a `b13` block at slot 11 and layer 6 to create the horizontal line of the "K" character:
```
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

5. The resulting structure will now look like the character "K" and meet the stability and boundary intrusion constraints.

You can modify the specific block types and positions to create different structures that meet the desired constraints.
