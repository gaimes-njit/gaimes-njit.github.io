To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "K" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet the given constraints, we need to carefully choose the dropping positions and order of the blocks.

Here is a possible solution:

1. Start by dropping a b31 block at slot 7 to form the left leg of the "K". This block will be on layer 1.
`ab_drop('b31', 7)`

2. Drop a b31 block at slot 8 to form the right leg of the "K". This block will be on layer 1.
`ab_drop('b31', 8)`

3. Drop a b31 block at slot 9 to connect the legs and form the middle part of the "K". This block will be on layer 2.
`ab_drop('b31', 9)`

4. Drop a b13 block at slot 7 to form the top part of the "K". This block will be on layer 0.
`ab_drop('b13', 7)`

5. Drop a b13 block at slot 9 to connect the top part to the middle part of the "K". This block will be on layer 0.
`ab_drop('b13', 9)`

By following this sequence of block drops, we ensure stability and meet the constraint of no boundary intrusion.

Note: The exact dropping positions and order may vary based on the specific implementation of the `ab_drop()` function and the mapping of slots and layers. Adjustments may be necessary to match the specific constraints and environment described in the problem.
