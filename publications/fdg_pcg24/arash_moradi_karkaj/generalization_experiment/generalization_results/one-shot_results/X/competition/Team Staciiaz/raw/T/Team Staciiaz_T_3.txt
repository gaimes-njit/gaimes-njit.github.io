To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "T" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the code provided:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a specific order and position. The objective is to create a stable structure while avoiding boundary intrusion.

Below is an example of how we can use the `ab_drop()` function to generate the "T" structure:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop a horizontal block at slot 9
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop a square block on top of the horizontal block at slot 9
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Drop a vertical block next to the horizontal block at slot 10
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` function calls will create a stable structure that looks like the character "T" and satisfies the constraints. The position and order of the block drops are crucial for stability.

You can modify the block types and their positions in the code to generate different structures that meet the constraints. It is important to ensure stability and avoid boundary intrusion when creating any structure using the `ab_drop()` function.
