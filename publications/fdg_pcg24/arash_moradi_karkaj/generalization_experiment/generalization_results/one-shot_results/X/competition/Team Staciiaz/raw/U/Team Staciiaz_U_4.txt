To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "U" and meets all the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function and a systematic approach to dropping the blocks.

Here's a step-by-step approach to building the structure:

1. Start with an empty grid structure of size WxH as mentioned in the definitions section.
2. First, drop a b31 block at slot 2 using `ab_drop('b31', 2)`. This will form the base of the letter "U".
3. Next, drop a b13 block at slot 1 using `ab_drop('b13', 1)`. This block will connect the left side of the base to the left side of the U-shape.
4. Then, drop a b11 block at slot 0 using `ab_drop('b11', 0)`. This will form the left side of the U-shape.
5. Similarly, drop a b11 block at slot 3 using `ab_drop('b11', 3)`. This will form the right side of the U-shape.
6. Finally, drop a b13 block at slot 4 using `ab_drop('b13', 4)`. This block will connect the right side of the base to the right side of the U-shape.

With these steps, the `ab_drop()` function will handle the positioning and order of dropping the blocks, ensuring stability and avoiding boundary intrusion. The resulting structure will meet all the constraints and look like the character "U".
