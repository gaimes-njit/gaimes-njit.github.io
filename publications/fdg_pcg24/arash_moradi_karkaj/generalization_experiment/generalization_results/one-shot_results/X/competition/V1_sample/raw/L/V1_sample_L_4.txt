Given the shape of the "L" we are aiming to create, we will first drop a block b31 at layer 15 with its center at slot 10. This block will represent the vertical part of the "L". Next, we will drop a block b13 at layer 14 with its center at slot 10. This block will form the horizontal part of the "L".

The code snippet using the ‘ab drop()’ function to achieve this structure is as follows:

ab drop(b31, 15, 10)
ab drop(b13, 14, 10)

By dropping the blocks in this order and position, we will successfully create a stable structure that looks like the letter "L".
