The goal is to create a structure resembling the letter "J" using the provided `ab_drop()` function and adhering to the given constraints. Here is one possible solution:

```python
structure = [[' ']*20 for _ in range(16)]

# Drop the first block (b31) in the middle of the bottom layer
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the second block (b13) in the first slot of the second layer
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Drop the third block (b11) in the first slot of the third layer
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Drop the fourth block (b11) in the middle of the third layer
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

This solution starts by dropping a horizontal block (b31) in the middle of the bottom layer. Then, a vertical block (b13) is dropped in the first slot of the second layer. A small horizontal block (b11) is dropped in the first slot of the third layer. Finally, another small horizontal block (b11) is dropped in the middle of the third layer.

If executed correctly, this series of `ab_drop()` calls will result in a stable structure resembling the letter "J" while satisfying all the given constraints.
