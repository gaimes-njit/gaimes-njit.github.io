To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "C" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully plan the placement of each block type (b11, b31, and b13) while considering the stability constraints.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

Step 1: Start by dropping a b13 block at the bottom of the structure, centered at slot 10 (assuming W = 20). This will act as the base of the "C" shape.
```
ab_drop('b13', 10)  # Drops a b13 block at slot 10
```

Step 2: Drop two b31 blocks on top of the base b13 block. Center the first b31 block at slot 9 and the second b31 block at slot 11.
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drops a b31 block at slot 9
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Drops a b31 block at slot 11
```

Step 3: Drop a b11 block on top of each b31 block, aligned with the center slot.
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drops a b11 block at slot 9
ab_drop('b11', 11)  # Drops a b11 block at slot 11
```

Step 4: Drop a b31 block on top of the first b31 block, centered at slot 14. This will create the curve in the "C" shape.
```
ab_drop('b31', 14)  # Drops a b31 block at slot 14
```

Step 5: Drop a b11 block on top of the last dropped b31 block, aligned with the center slot.
```
ab_drop('b11', 14)  # Drops a b11 block at slot 14
```

By following these steps, you will generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "C" while satisfying the hard constraints and considering the stability of each drop.

Remember to perform stability checks before each call to `ab_drop()` to ensure the entire structure remains stable during the generation process.
