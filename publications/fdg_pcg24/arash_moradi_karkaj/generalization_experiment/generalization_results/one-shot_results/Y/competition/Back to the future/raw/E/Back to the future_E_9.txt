To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "E", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the drop positions for each block type to form an "E" shape.

3. For the first vertical block (b13), drop it at the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

4. For the second vertical block (b13), drop it at the slot next to the first block, slightly shifted upwards:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2 + 1)
```

5. For the horizontal block (b31), drop it at the slot next to the second vertical block, aligned with the center slot:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2 + 2)
```

6. For the third vertical block (b13), drop it at the slot next to the horizontal block, slightly shifted upwards:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2 + 3)
```

7. For the last vertical block (b13), drop it at the slot next to the third vertical block, slightly shifted upwards:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2 + 4)
```

8. Repeat steps 3-7 for stability checks before each drop to ensure the structure remains stable.

By following these steps, you should be able to generate a stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "E".
