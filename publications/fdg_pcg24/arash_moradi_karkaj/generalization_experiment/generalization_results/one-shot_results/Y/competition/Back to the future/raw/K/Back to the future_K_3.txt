To generate a stable structure that looks like the letter "K" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` variable.
2. Start by dropping the vertical block, b13, in the center of the bottom layer (layer 0) using the `ab_drop()` function. The center slot (y) can be calculated as W/2 - 1, where W is the width of the map.
3. After dropping the vertical block, drop two horizontal blocks, b31, above it. The center slot (y) for the first horizontal block can be calculated as W/2 - 2, and for the second horizontal block as W/2.
4. Next, drop another vertical block, b13, above the left side of the previous vertical block. Calculate the center slot (y) as W/2 - 1.
5. Finally, drop a horizontal block, b31, above the second vertical block. Calculate the center slot (y) as W/2 - 1.

After following these steps, the `structure` should resemble the uppercase character "K" and meet all the hard constraints. The exact coordinates of `ab_drop()` calls will depend on the values of W and H.
