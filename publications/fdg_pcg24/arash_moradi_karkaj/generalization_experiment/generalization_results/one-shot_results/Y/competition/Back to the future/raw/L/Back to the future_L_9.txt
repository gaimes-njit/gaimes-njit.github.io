To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "L" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code snippet:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. To ensure stability, we need to carefully drop each block in the right position. We will use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks.

3. Start by dropping the b31 block at the bottom layer with its center aligned in slot 7 (W/2 - 1) using the `ab_drop('b31', 7)` function. This block will provide stability and support for the entire structure.

4. Next, drop the b13 block on top of the b31 block, centered in slot 7. This block will complete the vertical part of the "L" shape. Use the `ab_drop('b13', 7)` function.

5. Finally, drop the b11 block to the right of the b31 block, centered in slot 9. This block will complete the horizontal part of the "L" shape. Use the `ab_drop('b11', 9)` function.

6. The resulting structure will resemble the uppercase character "L" and meet all the hard constraints.

Here is an example of how the code will look like:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Function implementation (omitted for brevity)

ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

Make sure to adjust the coordinates and blocks according to the actual desired position of the "L" shape.
