To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "U" and meets all the hard constraints, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the b31 block in the middle of the bottom layer, ensuring stability:
```
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```
This will result in the following structure:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
structure[H-1][W//2] = 'b31'
```
Coordinates: [(15, 9)]

3. Drop the b13 block above the b31 block, ensuring stability and support:
```
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```
This will result in the following structure:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
structure[H-2][W//2] = 'b13'
structure[H-1][W//2] = 'b31'
```
Coordinates: [(14, 9)]

4. Drop the b13 block to the left of the b31 block, ensuring stability and support:
```
ab_drop('b13', W//2 - 1)
```
This will result in the following structure:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
structure[H-3][W//2 - 1] = 'b13'
structure[H-2][W//2] = 'b13'
structure[H-1][W//2] = 'b31'
```
Coordinates: [(13, 8), (14, 9)]

5. Drop the b13 block to the right of the b31 block, ensuring stability and support:
```
ab_drop('b13', W//2 + 1)
```
This will result in the following structure:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
structure[H-3][W//2 - 1] = 'b13'
structure[H-2][W//2] = 'b13'
structure[H-3][W//2 + 1] = 'b13'
structure[H-1][W//2] = 'b31'
```
Coordinates: [(13, 8), (14, 9), (13, 10)]

6. Drop the b31 block above the b13 blocks, ensuring stability and support:
```
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```
This will result in the following structure:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
structure[H-5][W//2] = 'b31'
structure[H-3][W//2 - 1] = 'b13'
structure[H-2][W//2] = 'b13'
structure[H-3][W//2 + 1] = 'b13'
structure[H-1][W//2] = 'b31'
```
Coordinates: [(11, 9)]

7. Drop the b11 block above the b31 block, ensuring stability and support:
```
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
```
This will result in the following structure:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
structure[H-6][W//2] = 'b11'
structure[H-5][W//2] = 'b31'
structure[H-3][W//2 - 1] = 'b13'
structure[H-2][W//2] = 'b13'
structure[H-3][W//2 + 1] = 'b13'
structure[H-1][W//2] = 'b31'
```
Coordinates: [(10, 9)]

Now, the structure resembles the uppercase letter "U" and meets all the hard constraints. The coordinates of each ab_drop are listed above to indicate the placement of each block.
