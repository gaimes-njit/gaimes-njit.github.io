To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Z" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at the bottom layer (layer 0) and a centrally aligned b31 block on top of it. This will form the left side of the "Z" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

3. To ensure stability, check if any part of the structure is unstable after each drop. If it is unstable, adjust the position and/or add additional supporting blocks before calling `ab_drop()` again.

4. Next, drop another b13 block on top of the previously dropped b31 block, aligned with its left side. This will form the diagonal part of the "Z" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to create the right side of the "Z" shape. Drop a b31 block on top of the previously dropped b13 block, aligned with its right side, and then drop another b13 block on top of it:
```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

6. After dropping all the necessary blocks, the structure should resemble the uppercase character "Z".

Here is the complete code for generating a stable "Z" structure using the `ab_drop()` function:

```python
# Role: Player of Tetris game
# Definitions: Slots, Layers, Base, Top
# Map Initialization
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Tool: ab_drop()
def ab_drop(x, y):
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    print(f"ab_drop('{x}', {y})")

# Generate the "Z" structure
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
ab_drop('b13', W//2)

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

Note: The code includes `print()` statements to display the `ab_drop()` function calls for each block drop. You can remove these statements if they are not needed.
