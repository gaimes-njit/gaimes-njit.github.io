To form the shape resembling the letter "E" using the available props and the ab_drop() function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the map as a 2D array with dimensions 20x16 to represent the field. Each cell can be initialized as empty.

2. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cells (4, 0), (5, 0), and (6, 0).

3. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5 again using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cells (4, 1), (5, 1), and (6, 1).

4. Drop a b11 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cell (5, 2).

5. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cells (4, 3), (5, 3), and (6, 3).

6. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5 again using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cells (4, 4), (5, 4), and (6, 4).

7. Drop a b11 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cell (5, 5).

8. Drop a b11 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cell (5, 6).

9. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cells (4, 7), (5, 7), and (6, 7).

10. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5 again using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cells (4, 8), (5, 8), and (6, 8).

11. Drop a b11 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cell (5, 9).

12. Drop a b11 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cell (5, 10).

13. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cells (4, 11), (5, 11), and (6, 11).

14. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5 again using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cells (4, 12), (5, 12), and (6, 12).

15. Drop a b11 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cell (5, 13).

16. Drop a b11 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cell (5, 14).

17. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5 using the ab_drop() function. This will occupy the cells (4, 15), (5, 15), and (6, 15).

After these steps, the cells in the field will be occupied as mentioned, forming a shape resembling the letter "E" while satisfying the stability and boundary collision requirements.
