To form a shape resembling the letter "P" using the available bricks, we can start by analyzing the structure and determining the sequence of ab_drop() function calls.

The shape of the letter "P" consists of a vertical line on the left and a horizontal line on the top connected at one end. We can use the b13 brick for the vertical line and the b31 brick for the horizontal line.

Based on this analysis, we can execute the following sequence of ab_drop() function calls to generate the required structure:

1. Place the b13 brick starting at x_position = 2, y = 15. This will create a vertical line on the left side. The cells (2, 12), (2, 13), and (2, 14) will be occupied.

2. Place the b31 brick starting at x_position = 2, y = 15. This will create a horizontal line on top connected to the vertical line. The cells (0, 11), (1, 11), and (2, 11) will be occupied. The cells (3, 11), (4, 11), and (5, 11) will be occupied. The cells (6, 11), (7, 11), and (8, 11) will be occupied.

With these ab_drop() function calls, we have formed the shape resembling the letter "P" using the available bricks. The structure is stable as there are no differences in the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot. The occupied cells of the bricks do not exceed the boundaries of the field.
