To form the shape resembling the letter "T" using the available bricks and following the important notes, we can break down the task into smaller steps.

Step 1: Place the b11 brick on the ground
- Execute the function `ab_drop('b11', 9)` to place the b11 brick on the ground at x_position 9.

Step 2: Place the b31 brick vertically above the b11 brick
- Execute the function `ab_drop('b31', 9)` to place the b31 brick starting at x_position 9.
- The b31 brick will land above the b11 brick, occupying cells (9, 1), (10, 1), and (11, 1).

Step 3: Place the b13 brick horizontally above the b31 and b11 bricks
- Execute the function `ab_drop('b13', 10)` to place the middle cell of the b13 brick at x_position 10.
- The b13 brick will land horizontally above the b31 and b11 bricks, occupying cells (10, 2), (10, 3), and (10, 4).

The final structure will resemble the letter "T" with the b11 brick on the ground, the b31 brick above it, and the b13 brick above the b31 and b11 bricks.
