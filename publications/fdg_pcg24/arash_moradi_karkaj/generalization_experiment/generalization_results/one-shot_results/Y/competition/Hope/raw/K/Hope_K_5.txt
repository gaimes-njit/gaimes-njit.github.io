To create the structure of the letter "K" inside a 20*16 box block, we can use the following commands:

1. Place the first vertical line of the "K":
    - ab_drop('b31', 2) - This will drop a 3*1 block starting at position (2,0).

2. Place the diagonal line of the "K":
    - ab_drop('b13', 5) - This will drop a 1*3 block starting at position (5,1).
    - ab_drop('b13', 6) - This will drop a 1*3 block starting at position (6,2).
    - ab_drop('b13', 7) - This will drop a 1*3 block starting at position (7,3).

3. Place the second vertical line of the "K":
    - ab_drop('b31', 8) - This will drop a 3*1 block starting at position (8,4).

This sequence of commands will create a letter "K" structure inside the 20*16 box block.
