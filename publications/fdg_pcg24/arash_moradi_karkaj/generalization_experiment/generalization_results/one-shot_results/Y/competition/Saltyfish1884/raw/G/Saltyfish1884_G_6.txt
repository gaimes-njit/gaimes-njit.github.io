To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "G", we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid
We need to initialize the structure grid as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet.

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the base blocks
We need to place the base blocks (b11 or b13) at the bottom layer to form a solid base for the structure. This satisfies the stability constraint. Let's use b11 blocks for simplicity.

```
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop("b11", i)
```

Step 3: Place the vertical block to form the first vertical stroke of "G"
We need to place a b13 block vertically, starting from the second layer, at a suitable slot to form the first vertical stroke of "G". This again satisfies the stability constraint.

```
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

Step 4: Place the horizontal block to connect the first and second vertical strokes of "G"
We need to place a b31 block horizontally, starting from the second layer and aligning with the center slot, to connect the first and second vertical strokes of "G". This ensures stability and prevents overhangs.

```
ab_drop("b31", W // 2)
```

Step 5: Place the vertical block to form the second vertical stroke of "G"
We need to place another b13 block vertically, starting from the second layer, at a suitable slot to form the second vertical stroke of "G". This maintains stability and completes the structure.

```
ab_drop("b13", W // 2)
```

Step 6: Print the final structure
Using the provided code snippet, print the final structure to visualize the generated "G" shape.

```
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

Putting it all together:

```
# Step 1: Initialize the structure grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Step 2: Place the base blocks
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop("b11", i)

# Step 3: Place the vertical block to form the first vertical stroke of "G"
ab_drop("b13", 0)

# Step 4: Place the horizontal block to connect the first and second vertical strokes of "G"
ab_drop("b31", W // 2)

# Step 5: Place the vertical block to form the second vertical stroke of "G"
ab_drop("b13", W // 2)

# Step 6: Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This will generate a stable structure resembling the character "G" while meeting all the given constraints.
