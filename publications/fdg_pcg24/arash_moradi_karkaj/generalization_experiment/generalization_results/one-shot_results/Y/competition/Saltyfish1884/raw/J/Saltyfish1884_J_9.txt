To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "J" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Define the drop positions and orders for each block type to ensure stability and prevent boundary intrusion.

2. Determine the shape of the structure that resembles the character "J" by placing the blocks in the appropriate positions.

3. Use the ab_drop() function to put the suitable blocks in the structure.

Here's an example of how to achieve this:

```python
# Step 1: Define drop positions and orders
b11_drop_pos = [(13, 9), (12, 9), (11, 9), (10, 9)]
b31_drop_pos = [(9, 10), (9, 9), (9, 8)]
b13_drop_pos = [(12, 10), (11, 10)]

# Step 2: Define the shape of the structure
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Place the b11 blocks to form the character "J"
for pos in b11_drop_pos:
    structure[pos[0]][pos[1]] = 'b11'

# Place the b31 block on top of the b11 block to prevent overhangs
for pos in b31_drop_pos:
    structure[pos[0]][pos[1]] = 'b31'

# Place the b13 block on top of the b31 block to complete the structure
for pos in b13_drop_pos:
    structure[pos[0]][pos[1]] = 'b13'

# Step 3: Use the ab_drop() function to put the suitable blocks in the structure
for row in structure:
    for block_type in row:
        if block_type != ' ':
            ab_drop(block_type, row.index(block_type))

# Print the final structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The output will be a stable structure that resembles the character "J", meeting all the given requirements. Please note that the provided drop positions and orders may not result in a perfect "J" shape, so you can adjust them as needed to achieve the desired shape.
