To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all the given constraints, we can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet.

Step 2: Drop the b13 block in slot 0 using the ab_drop() function. This will create the left vertical part of the "N" character.

Step 3: Drop the b31 block in slot 1 using the ab_drop() function. This will create the horizontal part of the "N" character.

Step 4: Drop the b13 block in slot 2 using the ab_drop() function. This will create the right vertical part of the "N" character.

Step 5: To meet the stability constraint, we need to ensure that the b31 block is placed on a solid base. To do this, we can modify the drop position and drop order. Drop the b13 block in slot 2 first, followed by the b31 block in slot 1, and then the b13 block in slot 0.

Step 6: The resulting structure will resemble the character "N" and satisfy the stability constraint. The final code will look like the following:

```python
# define dimensions
W = 20
H = 16

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# drop b13 block in slot 0
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# drop b31 block in slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# drop b13 block in slot 2
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

The resulting structure will have a stable "N" shape formed by blocks b13 and b31, meeting all the given constraints.
