To generate the desired structure that resembles the character "R", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base block (b11) at the bottom layer:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```
This will ensure stability and prevent the structure from collapsing.

3. Place the vertical block (b13) above the base block:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```
This will create the vertical stem of the "R" character.

4. Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```
This will create the top part of the "R" character.

5. Place another vertical block (b13) next to the horizontal block to complete the "R" shape:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

The resulting structure will resemble the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.

Note: The specific slot numbers (y values) used in the ab_drop() function may vary slightly depending on the desired placement within the available slots, but the overall structure and block types remain the same.
