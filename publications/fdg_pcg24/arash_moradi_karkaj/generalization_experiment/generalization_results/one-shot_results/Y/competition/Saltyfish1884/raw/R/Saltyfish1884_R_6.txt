To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R," we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

3. Place the vertical block of the "R":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```

4. Place the horizontal block of the "R":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

Here's the complete code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Place the base blocks
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)

# Place the vertical block of the "R"
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Place the horizontal block of the "R"
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b31', 10)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints.
