To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "Z" while meeting all constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code.

2. Place a b31 block at slot 3 to act as the base for the structure:
   ab_drop('b31', 3)

3. Place a b11 block on top of the base at slot 3:
   ab_drop('b11', 3)

4. Place two b13 blocks vertically on top of each other at slot 4:
   ab_drop('b13', 4)
   ab_drop('b13', 4)

5. Place a b11 block on top of the two b13 blocks at slot 4:
   ab_drop('b11', 4)

6. Place a b31 block on top of the b11 block at slot 3:
   ab_drop('b31', 3)

7. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block at slot 3:
   ab_drop('b11', 3)

8. Place a b11 block on top of the b11 block at slot 2:
   ab_drop('b11', 2)

9. Place a b11 block on top of the b11 block at slot 1:
   ab_drop('b11', 1)

10. Place a b31 block on top of the b11 block at slot 1:
    ab_drop('b31', 1)

11. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block at slot 1:
    ab_drop('b11', 1)

12. Place a b11 block on top of the b11 block at slot 0:
    ab_drop('b11', 0)

13. Place a b11 block on top of the b11 block at slot 19:
    ab_drop('b11', 19)

14. Place a b31 block on top of the b11 block at slot 19:
    ab_drop('b31', 19)

15. Place a b11 block on top of the b31 block at slot 19:
    ab_drop('b11', 19)

This sequence of dropping blocks according to the given constraints will result in a stable structure that resembles the character "Z".
