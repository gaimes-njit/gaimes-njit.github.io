To generate the letter "D", we can break it down into two parts: a vertical pipe and a semicircle.

First, we will place the vertical pipe. We will start from the bottom and work our way up.

We'll use the "b31" block type for the vertical pipe.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Next, we will place the semicircle on top of the vertical pipe.

We'll use the "b13" block type for the semicircle. We'll start from the leftmost side.

```
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```

This completes the implementation to generate the letter "D".

The complete implementation is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9) # Vertical pipe
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)

ab_drop("b13", 6) # Semicircle
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
```
