To build the capital letter "K" on the grid, we need to consider the stability of the blocks. Let's break the problem down into multiple steps:

Step 1: Build the left vertical bar of the letter "K".
- Drop a column block "b13" centered at x_position = 4.
  ab_drop("b13", 4)

Step 2: Build the top horizontal bar of the letter "K".
- Drop a row block "b31" centered at x_position = 7.
  ab_drop("b31", 7)

Step 3: Build the bottom horizontal bar of the letter "K".
- Drop a row block "b31" centered at x_position = 7.
  ab_drop("b31", 7)

Step 4: Build the right diagonal bar of the letter "K".
- Drop a row block "b31" centered at x_position = 10.
  ab_drop("b31", 10)

Note: The order of dropping the blocks is important to maintain stability.
