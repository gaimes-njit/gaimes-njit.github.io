To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital "L", we can start by placing the vertical pipe block (b31) at the bottom-left corner of the grid. Then we can place the bottom bar block (b13) on top of the vertical pipe block to complete the "L" shape.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
# Step 1: Place the vertical pipe block at the bottom-left corner
ab_drop("b31", 0)

# Step 2: Place the bottom bar block on top of the vertical pipe block
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

This implementation ensures stability by placing the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion, with the bottom bar block resting on top of the vertical pipe block. The resulting structure will resemble the capital "L" shape.
