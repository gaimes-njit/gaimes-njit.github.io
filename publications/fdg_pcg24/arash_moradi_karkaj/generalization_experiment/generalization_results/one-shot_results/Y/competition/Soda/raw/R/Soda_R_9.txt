To generate a structure that looks like the letter "R", we can break it down into three blocks - a vertical column block, a horizontal row block, and a diagonal row block.

First, we need to drop the vertical column block at the left side of the grid to form the vertical part of the "R". We can position it at x_position = 1.

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

Next, we need to drop the horizontal row block on top of the column block to form the top bar of the "R". We can position it at x_position = 1.

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Finally, we need to drop the diagonal row block on top of the column block to form the diagonal part of the "R". We can position it at x_position = 3.

```
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

The complete implementation would look like this:

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```
