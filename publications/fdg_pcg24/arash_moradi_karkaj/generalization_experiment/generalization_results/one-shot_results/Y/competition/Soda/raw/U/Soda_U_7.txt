To create a structure that looks like a capital "U" (TARGET), we can divide the construction process into three steps:

Step 1: Place the bottom bar of the "U"
We will use a row block (b31) to create the bottom bar of the "U". To ensure stability, we will place it at the center of the bottom row, x_position=9.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 2: Place the left vertical bar of the "U"
Next, we will use a column block (b13) to create the left vertical bar of the "U". To ensure stability, we will place it at the second column from the left, x_position=1.

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

Step 3: Place the right vertical bar of the "U"
Finally, we will use another column block (b13) to create the right vertical bar of the "U". To ensure stability, we will place it at the second column from the right, x_position=18.

```
ab_drop("b13", 18)
```

Now we have completed the construction of the "U" structure.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 18)
```
