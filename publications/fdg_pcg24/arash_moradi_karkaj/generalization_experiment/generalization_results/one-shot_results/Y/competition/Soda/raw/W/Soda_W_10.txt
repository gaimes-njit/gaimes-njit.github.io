To generate a structure in the shape of a capital "W", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the base blocks of the "W" structure first. These are three row blocks ("b31") placed one below the other.
2. Place two column blocks ("b13") on top of the row blocks to form the left and right arms of the "W".
3. Place a small square block ("b11") on top of the center row block to connect the left and right arms.

Here's the code to implement this structure:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b11", 9)
```

This code will drop the blocks in the specified order and positions to create a stable structure that resembles the letter "W" on the 2D grid.
