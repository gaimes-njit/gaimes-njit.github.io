To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "X", we can divide the structure into four parts: 

1. The diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right corner.
2. The diagonal line from the bottom-right to the top-left corner.
3. The horizontal line at the center.
4. The vertical line at the center.

To create the first part, we can drop a column block ("b13") starting from the bottom-left corner and centered at the slot (9). This will create a diagonal line of 3 blocks.

Next, we can create the second part by dropping a column block ("b13") starting from the bottom-right corner and centered at the slot (10). This will create another diagonal line of 3 blocks.

To create the horizontal line at the center, we can drop a row block ("b31") starting from the bottom-middle slot and centered at the slot (9). This will create a horizontal line of 3 blocks.

Finally, we can create the vertical line at the center by dropping a column block ("b13") starting from the bottom-middle slot and centered at the slot (10). This will create a vertical line of 3 blocks.

The complete implementation would be as follows:

ab_drop("b13", 9)   # Drop the first part of the diagonal line
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Drop the second part of the diagonal line
ab_drop("b31", 9)   # Drop the horizontal line at the center 
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Drop the vertical line at the center
