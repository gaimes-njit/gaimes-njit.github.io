To generate a structure in the shape of the letter "X", we can start by placing a row block ("b31") vertically in the middle of the grid. This will be the base of the "X". Then, we can place two column blocks ("b13") on either side of the row block, creating the diagonal parts of the "X". Here is the code implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the base block
ab_drop("b13", 8)  # Place the left diagonal block
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Place the right diagonal block
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are stacked in a bottom-to-top fashion, creating a stable and balanced structure similar to the letter "X".
