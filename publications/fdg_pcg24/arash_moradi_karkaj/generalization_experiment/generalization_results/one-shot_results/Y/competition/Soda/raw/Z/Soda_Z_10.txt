To create the structure in the shape of the capital letter "Z", we can follow these steps:

1. Place the base block of size 1*1 at the bottom-left corner.
2. Place the vertical bar block of size 1*3 above the base block, centered at the same x position as the base block.
3. Place the horizontal bar block of size 3*1 above the vertical bar block, centered at the same x position as the base block.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
# Step 1: Place the base block
ab_drop("b11", 0)

# Step 2: Place the vertical bar block
ab_drop("b13", 0)

# Step 3: Place the horizontal bar block
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

This implementation creates a stable structure in the shape of the capital letter "Z".
