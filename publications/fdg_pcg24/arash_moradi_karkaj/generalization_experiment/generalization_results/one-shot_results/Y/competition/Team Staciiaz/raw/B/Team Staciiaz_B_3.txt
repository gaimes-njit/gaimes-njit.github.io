To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "B" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully determine the dropping position and order of the blocks. Here's a step-by-step approach to meet the constraints:

1. Initialize the structure grid:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Start by selecting the bottom horizontal block (b31) to form the bottom part of the character "B". Drop it at slot 0:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

3. Next, select the vertical block (b13) to form the middle part of the character "B". Drop it at slot 0, aligned with the center of the bottom block:
```
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

4. Finally, select the top horizontal block (b31) to form the top part of the character "B". Drop it at slot 0, aligned with the center of the middle block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

By following this sequence of block dropping, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the character "B".
