To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "C" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop blocks and ensure stability and no boundary intrusion. Here's an approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. First, drop a b11 block at slot 0 and layer 0 to serve as the leftmost part of the "C" shape:
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

3. Next, drop a b31 block at slot 1 and layer 0 to connect the leftmost block:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. To complete the "C" shape, drop a b13 block at slot 4 and layer 1 to create the curved part of the structure:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

5. The resulting structure should resemble the character "C" and be stable.

This approach ensures stability by dropping blocks from bottom to top, and avoids boundary intrusion by selecting appropriate slots for each block.
