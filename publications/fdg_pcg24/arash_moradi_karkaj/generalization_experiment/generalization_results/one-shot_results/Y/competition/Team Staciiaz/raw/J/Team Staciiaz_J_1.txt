To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "J" while satisfying all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop the block types in order and position them properly. Here is one possible approach:

1. Start by dropping a `b11` block at slot 2 using `ab_drop('b11', 2)`. This will be the main body of the "J" shape.

2. Drop a `b31` block at slot 4 using `ab_drop('b31', 4)`. This will be the extended arm of the "J" shape.

3. Drop another `b31` block at slot 3 using `ab_drop('b31', 3)`. This will be the shorter arm of the "J" shape.

4. Finally, drop a `b31` block at slot 2 using `ab_drop('b31', 2)`. This will complete the upper part of the "J" shape.

By following this sequence of drops, we ensure stability and avoid any boundary intrusion, as the blocks are properly positioned to distribute the weight effectively.

Note: The placement of the blocks can vary depending on personal preferences or specific requirements. This solution is just one example of how the blocks can be dropped to meet the goal and constraints.
