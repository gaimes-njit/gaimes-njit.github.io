To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function and follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:
   ```
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at slot 0 and layer 0 to create the vertical part of the "L" character:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

3. Drop a b31 block at slot 0 and layer 3 to create the horizontal part of the "L" character:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 0)
   ```

4. Drop another b11 block at slot 3 and layer 3 to complete the top part of the "L" character:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 3)
   ```

5. Finally, drop a b11 block at slot 0 and layer 0 to complete the bottom part of the "L" character:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 0)
   ```

The resulting structure should be a stable "L" character that satisfies all the constraints.
