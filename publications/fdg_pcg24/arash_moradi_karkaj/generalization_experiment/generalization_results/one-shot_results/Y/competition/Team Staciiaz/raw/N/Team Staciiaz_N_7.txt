To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "N" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the given constraints, we need to carefully drop the blocks in a specific order.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code.
2. Drop the b13 block at slot 0 using the `ab_drop()` function. This block will serve as the left vertical part of the "N".
3. Drop the b13 block at slot 2 using the `ab_drop()` function. This block will serve as the right vertical part of the "N".
4. Drop the b31 block at slot 1 using the `ab_drop()` function. This block will serve as the diagonal middle part of the "N".

The above steps ensure that the blocks are placed in a stable manner, meeting the stability constraint. Additionally, by carefully choosing the slot positions, we ensure that there is no boundary intrusion, meeting the constraint for zero intrusion regions.

The resulting structure will look like the character "N" and will satisfy all the given constraints.
