To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "R" and meets all the given constraints, we need to carefully select the positions and order in which the blocks are dropped.

Here's one possible solution to generate the "R" structure:

1. Drop a b31 block at slot 2 using `ab_drop('b31', 2)`.
2. Drop a b11 block at slot 2 using `ab_drop('b11', 2)`.
3. Drop a b13 block at slot 2 using `ab_drop('b13', 2)`.
4. Drop a b31 block at slot 3 using `ab_drop('b31', 3)`.
5. Drop a b31 block at slot 4 using `ab_drop('b31', 4)`.
6. Drop a b11 block at slot 3 using `ab_drop('b11', 3)`.
7. Drop a b13 block at slot 5 using `ab_drop('b13', 5)`.

The above sequence of commands will drop the blocks in such a way that they form a structure resembling the character "R" and meet all the given constraints.

Please note that the stability and no boundary intrusion constraints are implicitly satisfied by using the `ab_drop()` function, as it ensures that the blocks are dropped in positions that maintain stability and do not intrude on the boundary of the map.
