To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Z" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop the blocks.

Here's the step-by-step process to achieve the goal:

1. Initialize the structure:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block `b31` at slot 0:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```
This will drop the block `b31` vertically at slot 0, aligning its center with layer H, and place it on the bottom layer (layer 0) of the structure.

3. Drop the second block `b13` at slot 3:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```
This will drop the block `b13` vertically at slot 3, aligning its center with layer H, and place it on the top of the previously dropped block.

4. Drop the third block `b31` at slot 5:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```
This will drop the block `b31` vertically at slot 5, aligning its center with layer H, and place it on top of the previously dropped blocks.

5. Drop the fourth block `b11` at slot 8:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```
This will drop the block `b11` vertically at slot 8, aligning its center with layer H, and place it on top of the previously dropped blocks.

6. Drop the fifth block `b31` at slot 9:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will drop the block `b31` vertically at slot 9, aligning its center with layer H, and place it on top of the previously dropped blocks.

7. Drop the sixth block `b13` at slot 12:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 12)
```
This will drop the block `b13` vertically at slot 12, aligning its center with layer H, and place it on top of the previously dropped blocks.

8. Drop the seventh block `b31` at slot 14:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 14)
```
This will drop the block `b31` vertically at slot 14, aligning its center with layer H, and place it on top of the previously dropped blocks.

9. Drop the eighth block `b11` at slot 17:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 17)
```
This will drop the block `b11` vertically at slot 17, aligning its center with layer H, and place it on top of the previously dropped blocks.

After executing these steps, the `structure` grid will represent a stable "Z" structure that meets all the constraints.
