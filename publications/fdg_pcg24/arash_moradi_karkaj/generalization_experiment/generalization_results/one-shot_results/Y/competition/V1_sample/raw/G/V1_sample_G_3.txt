Using the ‘ab drop()’ function, we can create the structure of the "G" shape by strategically dropping blocks in a specific order and position.

To achieve the desired shape, we will first drop a b31 block at slot 10 with its center at layer 15. This block will represent the vertical part of the "G".

Next, we will drop a b13 block at slot 11 with its center at layer 14. This block will represent the horizontal part of the "G".

Lastly, we will drop a b13 block at slot 10 with its center at layer 13. This block will complete the "G" shape by forming the curve.

By carefully choosing the positions and order of the blocks to drop, we can create a stable structure that mimics the shape of the letter "G" on the grid.
