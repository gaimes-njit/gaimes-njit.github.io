Starting with layer 15, drop a b13 block centered at slot 9.
Next, drop a b11 block at layer 14 centered at slot 9.
Drop another b11 block at layer 13 centered at slot 9.
Now, drop a b31 block at layer 12 centered at slot 9.
Finally, drop a b11 block at layer 11 centered at slot 9.

This should generate a stable structure that looks like the letter "P" with the given environment and tool.
