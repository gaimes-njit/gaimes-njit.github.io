To generate an "R" shape using the 'ab drop()' function, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a b31 block from layer 15 at slot 9 to form the vertical stem of the "R".

2. Next, drop a b13 block from layer 13 at slot 9 on top of the previously dropped b31 block to create the diagonal leg of the "R".

3. Finally, drop another b31 block from layer 9 at slot 6 next to the diagonal leg to complete the horizontal part of the "R".

By following these steps and carefully selecting the drop positions and order, you can create a stable structure that resembles the letter "R" using the 'ab drop()' function.
