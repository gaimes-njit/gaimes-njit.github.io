To generate a stable structure that looks like the letter "T" using the `ab drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a vertical block b13 from layer H-3 (layer 12) with its center at slot 9. This will represent the vertical part of the "T."

```ab drop(b13, 9, 12)```

2. Next, drop a horizontal block b31 from layer H-2 (layer 14) with its center at slot 9. This will represent the horizontal part of the "T."

```ab drop(b31, 9, 14)```

By following these steps and dropping the blocks in the specified positions and order, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the letter "T" using the `ab drop()` function.
