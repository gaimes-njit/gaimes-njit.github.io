To generate a stable structure that looks like the "Z," we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a b13 block centered at slot 9 on layer 15.
2. Drop a b11 block centered at slot 9 on layer 14.
3. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 9 on layer 13.
4. Drop a b11 block centered at slot 8 on layer 13.
5. Drop a b11 block centered at slot 10 on layer 13.
6. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 10 on layer 12.

This sequence of blocks dropped using the ‘ab drop()’ function will create a stable structure that resembles the letter "Z." The key is to carefully position and order the blocks to ensure stability and achieve the desired shape.
