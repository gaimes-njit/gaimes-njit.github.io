Since the letter "K" looks like a combination of two vertical lines connecting to a diagonal line, we can start by dropping the vertical lines first and then connect them with the diagonal line.

Here is the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls based on the database:
```
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
```
