1. Draw the letter "I" with asterisks:
```
*****
  *
  *
  *
  *
*****
```
2. List the asterisks and spaces in each row:
- Row 1: "*****"
- Row 2: "  *  "
- Row 3: "  *  "
- Row 4: "  *  "
- Row 5: "  *  "
- Row 6: "*****"

3. Convert asterisks to "x" and spaces to "y":
- Row 1: "xxxxx"
- Row 2: "  x  "
- Row 3: "  x  "
- Row 4: "  x  "
- Row 5: "  x  "
- Row 6: "xxxxx"

4. Write out each "x" and "y" for each row:
- Row 1: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5;"
- Row 2: "y-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; y-5;"
- Row 3: "y-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; y-5;"
- Row 4: "y-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; y-5;"
- Row 5: "y-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; y-5;"
- Row 6: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5;"

5. Indicate the position of each variable for each row:
- Row 1: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5;"
- Row 2: "y-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; y-5;"
- Row 3: "y-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; y-5;"
- Row 4: "y-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; y-5;"
- Row 5: "y-1; x-2; y-3; y-4; y-5;"
- Row 6: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5;"

6. Return a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row:
```python
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
```
