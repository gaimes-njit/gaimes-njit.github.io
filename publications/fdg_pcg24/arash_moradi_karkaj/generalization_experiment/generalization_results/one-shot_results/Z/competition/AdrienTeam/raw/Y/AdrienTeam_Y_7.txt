The structure of the "Y" can be constructed by dropping the blocks in a specific order and position. Here is the code to generate the structure:

```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Drop the bottom horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# Drop the left vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 8)

# Drop the right vertical block
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Drop the top horizontal block
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Note that the block types and slot positions are chosen to satisfy the constraints and create a stable structure resembling "Y".
