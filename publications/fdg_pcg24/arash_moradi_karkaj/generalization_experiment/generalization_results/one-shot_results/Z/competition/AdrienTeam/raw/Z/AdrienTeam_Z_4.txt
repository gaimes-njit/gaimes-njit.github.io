Here is the code to generate the structure resembling "Z":

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]  # Map initialization

# Drop the first block (b11) at the bottom left position
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Drop the second block (b31) at the bottom right position
ab_drop('b31', 19)

# Drop the third block (b13) at the second layer from the bottom and one slot away from the right edge
ab_drop('b13', 18)

# Drop the fourth block (b11) at the third layer from the bottom and one slot away from the right edge
ab_drop('b11', 18)

# Drop the fifth block (b11) at the top left position
ab_drop('b11', 0)

# Drop the sixth block (b31) at the second layer from the top and one slot away from the left edge
ab_drop('b31', 1)

# Drop the seventh block (b13) at the third layer from the top and two slots away from the left edge
ab_drop('b13', 2)

# Drop the eighth block (b11) at the top right position
ab_drop('b11', 19)

# Drop the ninth block (b11) at the third layer from the top and one slot away from the right edge
ab_drop('b11', 18)

```

The above code will create a stable structure resembling the letter "Z" while satisfying all the given constraints.
