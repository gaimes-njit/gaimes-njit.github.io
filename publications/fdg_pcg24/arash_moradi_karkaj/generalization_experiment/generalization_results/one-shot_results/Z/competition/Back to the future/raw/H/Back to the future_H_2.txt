To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase letter "H" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully drop the blocks in a specific order and position.

Here's a possible algorithm to accomplish this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code snippet:
   ```python
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Define a helper function, `is_stable(pos)`, to check if a given position `pos` in the structure is stable based on the rules provided in the constraints.

3. Drop the three b11 blocks to form the two vertical lines of the "H".
   - Drop the first b11 block at position `(4, 9)` (centered in slot 9) using `ab_drop('b11', 9)`.
   - Drop the second b11 block at position `(10, 9)` (centered in slot 9) using `ab_drop('b11', 9)`.
   - Drop the third b11 block at position `(7, 9)` (centered in slot 9) using `ab_drop('b11', 9)`.

4. Check the stability of the structure after dropping the first three blocks. If the structure is not stable, adjust the position of the blocks and repeat step 3 until a stable configuration is achieved.

5. Drop the b31 block to form the horizontal line of the "H".
   - Drop the b31 block at position `(7, 4)` (centered in slot 4) using `ab_drop('b31', 4)`.

6. Check the stability of the structure after dropping the b31 block. If the structure is not stable, adjust the position of the block and repeat step 5 until a stable configuration is achieved.

7. Check if the structure satisfies all the constraints, including the shape similarity to the uppercase letter "H". If not, repeat steps 3-6, making small adjustments to the block positions, until a satisfactory structure is achieved.

8. Once the stable structure that resembles the letter "H" is generated, print the final structure using the provided code snippet:
   ```python
   for row in structure:
       print(''.join(row))
   ```

Note: This algorithm provides a basic approach to generating a stable structure resembling the letter "H" using the `ab_drop()` function. There may be multiple valid solutions, and you can modify and optimize the algorithm based on your specific requirements and constraints.
