To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "J" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in a certain order to drop the blocks and build the structure.

Here is an approach to achieve the goal:

1. Drop b13 block at slot 9 using `ab_drop('b13', 9)`. This will form the vertical part of the "J" shape.

2. Drop b31 block at slots 7, 8, and 9 using `ab_drop('b31', 7)`, `ab_drop('b31', 8)`, and `ab_drop('b31', 9)`. This will form the horizontal part of the "J" shape.

3. Drop b11 block at slot 7 using `ab_drop('b11', 7)`. This will complete the bottom section of the "J" shape.

4. Drop b11 block at slot 9 using `ab_drop('b11', 9)`. This will form the dot on the lower right side of the "J" shape.

5. Drop b11 block at slot 10 using `ab_drop('b11', 10)`. This will form the horizontal line on the top part of the "J" shape.

By following this sequence of block drops, we can generate a stable structure that resembles the uppercase character "J" while satisfying all the hard constraints.

To ensure stability, we always check for stability before each call to the `ab_drop()` function. This ensures that the structure can remain stable during each drop without any accidents.

Please note that this approach is just one possible solution to achieve the goal and meet the hard constraints. There might be other valid approaches as well.
