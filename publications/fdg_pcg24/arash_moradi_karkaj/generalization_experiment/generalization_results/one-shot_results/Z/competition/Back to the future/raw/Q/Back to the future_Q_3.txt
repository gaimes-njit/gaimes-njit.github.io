To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "Q" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a strategic manner. Here is a possible approach:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop a b31 block at the center slot of the bottom layer (layer 0) to create a stable base:
```
ab_drop('b31', W//2)
```

3. Drop a b13 block on top of the base, slightly offset to the right:
```
ab_drop('b13', W//2 + 1)
```

4. Drop a b11 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with the center slot:
```
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
```

5. Drop a b31 block on top of the b11 block, offset to the left:
```
ab_drop('b31', W//2 - 1)
```

6. Drop a b13 block on top of the b31 block, slightly offset to the right:
```
ab_drop('b13', W//2)
```

7. Drop a b11 block on top of the b13 block, aligned with the center slot:
```
ab_drop('b11', W//2)
```

8. Repeat steps 5-7 to create the second "loop" of the "Q" shape.

9. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure that it remains stable.

10. Finally, verify that the overall shape is similar to the uppercase letter "Q" and meets the diversity constraint.

Note: The specific slot positions and offsets may vary depending on the desired shape of the "Q" and the stability of the structure. Experimentation and fine-tuning may be required to find the optimal solution.

For stability checks, you can use the following code after each drop:

```python
def check_stability(layer, slot):
    # Check if the block at the given layer and slot has stable support
    if structure[layer-1][slot] != ' ' or structure[layer-1][slot-1] != ' ' or structure[layer-1][slot+1] != ' ':
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Using this function, you can ensure that each drop has stable support before proceeding to the next drop.
