To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "S" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the following approach:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the provided code: `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Drop the middle horizontal block (b31) to provide stability for the upper parts of the structure. We can do this by calling `ab_drop('b31', 9)`.

3. Drop the bottom vertical block (b13) on the left side of the base to form the lower part of the "S" shape. We can do this by calling `ab_drop('b13', 2)`.

4. Drop the top vertical block (b13) on the left side of the middle horizontal block to form the upper part of the "S" shape. We can do this by calling `ab_drop('b13', 2)`.

5. Drop the top horizontal block (b31) on the right side of the middle horizontal block to complete the "S" shape. We can do this by calling `ab_drop('b31', 11)`.

The final structure should resemble the uppercase character "S" and meet all the hard constraints.

Please note that the coordinates provided in the ab_drop function calls are just for demonstration purposes and might need adjustment depending on the actual position of the blocks in the structure.
