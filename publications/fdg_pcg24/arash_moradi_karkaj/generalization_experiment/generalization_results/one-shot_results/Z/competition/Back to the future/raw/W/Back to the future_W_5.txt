To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "W" using the `ab_drop()` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` variable: `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`.

2. Drop the first b31 block at the center slot of the bottom layer using `ab_drop('b31', W/2)`. This will provide a stable base for the rest of the structure.

3. Drop two b13 blocks on top of the base to form the center peaks of the "W" shape. Place these blocks at slots W/4 and 3W/4 on the second layer using `ab_drop('b13', W/4)` and `ab_drop('b13', 3W/4)`.

4. Drop two b31 blocks on top of the center peaks to form the outer peaks of the "W" shape. Place these blocks at slots W/4 and 3W/4 on the third layer using `ab_drop('b31', W/4)` and `ab_drop('b31', 3W/4)`.

5. Drop three b11 blocks on top of the outer peaks to complete the "W" shape. Place these blocks at slots W/4, W/2, and 3W/4 on the fourth layer using `ab_drop('b11', W/4)`, `ab_drop('b11', W/2)`, and `ab_drop('b11', 3W/4)`.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the rest of the layers, alternating between the center peaks and the outer peaks.

7. After generating the entire structure, check its stability to ensure that each block has a stable support below it. If any blocks are unstable, adjust the placement of the blocks to improve stability.

8. Finally, check if the generated structure resembles the uppercase letter "W" and make any necessary adjustments to the block placement to achieve the desired shape.

Remember to always list the coordinates of the `ab_drop` function calls to keep track of the block placement. Additionally, ensure that the `y` parameter in `ab_drop` is an accurate coordinate instead of a formula with `W` to maintain consistency and avoid errors.
