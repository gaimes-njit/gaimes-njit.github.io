To generate a structure resembling the letter "D", we will need to use the available props and the ab_drop() function. Let's break the structure down into individual bricks and place them one by one.

First, we will place the base of the letter "D" using a b31 brick. We can start at x_position = 5 and drop the brick on the ground:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

Next, we will add the vertical stem of the letter "D" using a b13 brick. We can start at x_position = 5 and drop the brick from above the base:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Finally, we will add the top part of the letter "D" using two b11 bricks placed horizontally. We can start at x_position = 4 and drop the bricks from above the stem:

```python
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```

The final code to generate the structure resembling the letter "D" is:

```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
```
