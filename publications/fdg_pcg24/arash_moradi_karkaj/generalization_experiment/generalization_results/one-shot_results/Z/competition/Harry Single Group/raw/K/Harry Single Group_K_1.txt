```

The code above generates a structure resembling the letter "K" using the `ab_drop()` function. The letter "K" is formed by stacking a 3x1 brick on top of a 1x3 brick, and then stacking another 3x1 brick on top of the second brick.

The code initializes a 2D map with the size of the field (16 rows x 20 columns). The `check_collision()` function is used to check if there is a collision with the current brick being dropped. The `ab_drop()` function takes the type of brick and the x-position as parameters, and drops the brick on the field while avoiding collisions and boundary collisions.

In this case, the `ab_drop()` function is called four times to generate the letter "K" structure. The x-position for dropping the bricks is chosen to be 8 and 12 respectively, to ensure the bricks are centered. The resulting map is then displayed.

The output of the code will be a visualization of the generated structure resembling the letter "K".
