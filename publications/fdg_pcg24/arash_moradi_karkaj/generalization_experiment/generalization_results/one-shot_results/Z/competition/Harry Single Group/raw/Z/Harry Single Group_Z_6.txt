To form a shape resembling the letter "Z" using the given bricks, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the "field" as a 2D list with dimensions 16x20 to represent the 320 cells.
2. Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5 to create the top part of the "Z". This can be done by calling the ab_drop('b31', 5) function.
3. Drop a b13 brick at x_position = 3 to create the bottom part of the "Z". This can be done by calling the ab_drop('b13', 3) function.

Here is the code to generate the required structure:

```python
# Initialize the field
field = [[' ' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Function to check if a brick can be placed at the given position
def can_place_brick(brick, x_position):
    width = len(brick[0])
    height = len(brick)
    
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            if brick[y][x] != ' ' and field[y][x+x_position] != ' ':
                return False
    return True

# Function to place a brick at the given position
def place_brick(brick, x_position):
    width = len(brick[0])
    height = len(brick)
    
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            if brick[y][x] != ' ':
                field[y][x+x_position] = brick[y][x]

# Drop a b31 brick at x_position = 5
ab_drop('b31', 5)

# Drop a b13 brick at x_position = 3
ab_drop('b13', 3)

# Print the field
for row in field:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This code will print the field with the "Z" shape formed by the bricks:

```
        b31
        b31
        b31 b13 b13 b13
```
