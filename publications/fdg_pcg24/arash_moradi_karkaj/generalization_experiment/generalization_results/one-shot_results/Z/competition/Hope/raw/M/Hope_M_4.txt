To create the letter "M" using the provided block types and commands, you can follow these steps:

1. Drop a b31 block at x position 2 using ab_drop('b31', 2).
2. Drop a b13 block at x position 4 using ab_drop('b13', 4).
3. Drop a b13 block at x position 7 using ab_drop('b13', 7).
4. Drop a b31 block at x position 9 using ab_drop('b31', 9).

The resulting structure will look like this:

```
          __
         |__|
       __|  |__
      |       |
      |       |
      |       |
```

Please note that the box dimensions are represented for better visualization and may not be to scale. The actual structure will be within the 20x16 box.
