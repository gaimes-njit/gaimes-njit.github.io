To create an "X" shape using the given blocktypes and ab_drop command, you can use the following sequence of commands:

1. ab_drop('b31', 0) -> to create the top-left diagonal of the "X"
2. ab_drop('b31', 12) -> to create the top-right diagonal of the "X"
3. ab_drop('b13', 6) -> to create the horizontal line of the "X"
4. ab_drop('b31', 6) -> to create the vertical line of the "X"
5. ab_drop('b13', 9) -> to fix the overlap in the middle of the "X"
6. ab_drop('b13', 3) -> to fix the overlap in the middle of the "X"
