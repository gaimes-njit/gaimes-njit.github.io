To create the uppercase letter "A", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
- The first command places a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
- The second command places a square block ('b11') at position 2, below the previously placed block.
- The third command places another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3, below the square block.
- The fourth command places a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 2, connecting the two horizontal straight blocks and completing the letter "A".

Please note that this is just one of the many possible ways to create the letter "A" using the given block types and environment constraints.
