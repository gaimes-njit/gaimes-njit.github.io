To generate the uppercase English letter "B", we need to properly stack and position the block types as mentioned in the task. Here is the stream of commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)    # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)    # Place the horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 2)    # Place the square block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)    # Place the square block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)    # Place the square block at position 4
ab_drop('b31', 1)    # Place the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)    # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b31', 3)    # Place the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)    # Place the horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 1)    # Place the vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 5)    # Place the vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop('b13', 9)    # Place the vertical straight block at position 9
```

This series of commands will generate the uppercase letter "B" within the defined boundaries and gravity rules.
