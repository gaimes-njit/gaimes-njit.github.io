To generate the uppercase English letter "I", you can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the correct position to form the letter "I" within the allowed space boundaries.
