To generate the uppercase English letter "J", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

These commands will place the necessary blocks in the grid to form the letter "J", while adhering to the gravity rules and boundaries of the allowed space.
