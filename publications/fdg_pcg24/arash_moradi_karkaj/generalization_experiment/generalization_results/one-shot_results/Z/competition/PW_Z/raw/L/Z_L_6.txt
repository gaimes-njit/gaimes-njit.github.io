To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b31',3)
ab_drop('b13',3)
```

This will create a vertical straight block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units, followed by three horizontal straight blocks with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit. The result will resemble the letter "L" within the allowed space boundaries.
