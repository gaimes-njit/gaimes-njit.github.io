To generate the uppercase English letter "L", you can use the following sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  // Drop a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 2)  // Drop a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  // Drop a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 1)  // Drop a horizontal straight block at position 1
```

This sequence of commands will create a "L" shape formed by a vertical straight block on the left side and a horizontal straight block at the bottom.
