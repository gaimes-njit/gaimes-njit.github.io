To generate the uppercase letter "M", we can break it down into three parts: the two diagonal strokes and the center vertical stroke. We will use the block types b31 and b13 to construct the letter.

Here is the sequence of commands to generate the letter "M":

```
ab_drop('b31',1)  # Place the first diagonal stroke on the left side
ab_drop('b31',4)  # Place the second diagonal stroke on the right side
ab_drop('b13',3)  # Place the center vertical stroke in the middle
ab_drop('b31',7)  # Place a block below the center vertical stroke for stability
ab_drop('b31',10)  # Place a block below the second diagonal stroke for stability
```

By following these commands, the final result should resemble the uppercase letter "M" within the allowed space boundaries.
