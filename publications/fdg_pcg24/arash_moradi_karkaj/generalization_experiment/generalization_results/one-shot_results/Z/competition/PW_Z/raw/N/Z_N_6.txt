To generate the uppercase English letter "N" using the block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 1 to form the left vertical line of the letter:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Place a vertical block (b13) at position 4 to form the diagonal line of the letter:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

3. Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 7 to complete the right vertical line of the letter:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

4. Place a horizontal block (b31) at position 10 to form the bottom line of the letter:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

5. Place a vertical block (b13) at position 13 to finish the diagonal line of the letter:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b13', 13)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the letter "N" would be:
```plaintext
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 13)
```
