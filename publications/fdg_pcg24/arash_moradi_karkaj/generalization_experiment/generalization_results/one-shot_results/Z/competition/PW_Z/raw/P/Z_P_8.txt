To create the uppercase letter "P" in the defined environment, we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 1.
2. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 1.
3. Place another horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2.
4. Place one more horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 3.
5. Place a 1x1 square block ('b11') at position 1 to complete the vertical line of the letter "P".
6. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 3 to form the curve of the letter "P".

By following these commands, you will generate the uppercase letter "P" within the allowed boundaries and with proper stability according to the gravity rules.
