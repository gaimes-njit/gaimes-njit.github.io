To generate the uppercase English letter "Q", we will need to use a combination of block types in the defined environment. Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter:

```
ab_drop('b13',2)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b13',4)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b11',5)
ab_drop('b31',6)
ab_drop('b11',7)
ab_drop('b31',8)
ab_drop('b13',8)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "Q" by stacking and placing blocks in the required positions within the defined boundaries.
