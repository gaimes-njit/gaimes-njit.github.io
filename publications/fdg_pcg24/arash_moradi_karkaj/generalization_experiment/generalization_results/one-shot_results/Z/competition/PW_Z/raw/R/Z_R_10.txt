The stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "R" using the mentioned block types is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
```

This sequence of commands will place the blocks in the grid to form the shape of the letter "R" while maintaining structural stability with respect to the gravity rules.
