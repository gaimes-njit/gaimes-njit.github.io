To create the uppercase English letter "T" in the given environment, we can use the ab_drop() command with the following sequence of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 9
ab_drop('b11', 10) # Place the 1x1 square block at position 10
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 9
ab_drop('b13', 10) # Place the vertical straight block at position 10
ab_drop('b11', 10) # Place the 1x1 square block at position 10
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "T" in the specified environment, with the blocks stacked on top of each other to form the shape of the letter.
