To generate the uppercase letter "V" using the given block types, you can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

This will create the letter "V" by stacking the blocks in the correct orientation and position within the allowed space.
