To generate the uppercase English letter "W", we can break it down into three parts: the two diagonal lines at the top and bottom, and the middle vertical line.

Here are the commands to generate the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal block at the first position
ab_drop('b31', 4)  # Place the horizontal block at the fourth position
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Place the horizontal block at the seventh position
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical block at the second position
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Place the vertical block at the sixth position
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "W" using the blocks in the given environment.
