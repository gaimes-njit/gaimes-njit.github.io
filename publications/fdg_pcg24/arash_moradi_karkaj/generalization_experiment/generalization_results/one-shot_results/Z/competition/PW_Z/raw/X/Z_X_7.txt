To generate the uppercase English letter "X", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
ab_drop('b13', 11)
```

This sequence of commands will create three horizontal straight blocks ('b31') placed at positions 1, 5, and 9 along the width. Then, three vertical straight blocks ('b13') will be placed at positions 3, 7, and 11. Finally, the blocks will form the shape of the uppercase letter "X" within the defined boundaries of the grid.
