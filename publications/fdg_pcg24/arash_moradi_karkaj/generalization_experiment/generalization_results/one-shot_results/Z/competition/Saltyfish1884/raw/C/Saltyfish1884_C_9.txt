To generate a stable structure resembling the character "C" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b13 block at the bottom-left corner of the structure to act as the solid base:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 0)
```

3. Place a b31 block on top of the base, aligned with the left edge:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

4. Place a b11 block on top of the left side of the b31 block:

```python
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```

5. Place a b13 block above the b11 block, aligned with the left edge:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 2)
```

6. Place a b11 block above the b13 block, aligned with the left edge:

```python
ab_drop("b11", 2)
```
