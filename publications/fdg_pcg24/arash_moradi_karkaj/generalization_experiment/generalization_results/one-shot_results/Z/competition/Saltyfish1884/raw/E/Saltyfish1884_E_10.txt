To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "E" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan the dropping position and order of the blocks. 

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
```
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Start with the stability constraints in mind. A b31 block must be placed on a solid base to prevent overhangs. Therefore, we need to first drop a b11 block on the base (layer 0). Let's choose slot 0 as the dropping position for the b11 block.
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

Step 3: Next, we can drop a b13 block on top of the b11 block to create the vertical stroke of the "E". The dropping position for the b13 block can be slot 0 or slot 1. Let's choose slot 1 for now.
```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
```

Step 4: Now, we need to create the horizontal stroke of the "E". We can achieve this by dropping two b11 blocks side by side on top of the b13 block. The dropping positions for the b11 blocks can be slot 0 and slot 2.
```
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
```

Step 5: We have created the structure resembling the character "E". However, we still need to make sure that the structure is stable and meets all the constraints. To do so, we can drop a b31 block on top of the b11 blocks and align it with the b31 block on the base. The dropping position for the b31 block can be slot 0 or slot 2.
```
ab_drop('b31', 0)
```

Step 6: The final structure should resemble the character "E" and meet all the hard constraints. You can print the structure to visualize the result.
```
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The result may look something like this:
```
  b31
b11b11b11
  b13
```
