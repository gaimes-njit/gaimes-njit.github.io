To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "F" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid with dimensions WxH.

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Place the b31 block as the base of the structure. This will ensure stability and prevent overhangs.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Assuming the slot at index 9 is aligned with the center of the structure
```

Step 3: Place the b31 block on top of the base to form the vertical stem of the "F" character.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

Step 4: Place two b11 blocks on either side of the stem to form the horizontal crossbar of the "F" character.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 7)  # Assuming the slot at index 7 is aligned with the left side of the stem
ab_drop('b11', 11)  # Assuming the slot at index 11 is aligned with the right side of the stem
```

Step 5: Place a b11 block above the center of the stem to complete the "F" character.

```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

The resulting structure should resemble the character "F" while meeting all hard constraints.
