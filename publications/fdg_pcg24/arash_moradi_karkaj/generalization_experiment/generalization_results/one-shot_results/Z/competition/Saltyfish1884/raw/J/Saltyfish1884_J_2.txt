To generate a structure resembling the character "J" while meeting all the given constraints, follow these steps:

1. Identify the block types required to form the shape of the character "J". In this case, we would need one b31 block and two b13 blocks.

2. Determine the stable dropping positions for each block type. To ensure stability, the b31 block should be placed on the base at a suitable slot. The two b13 blocks should be placed adjacent to the b31 block in such a way that the overall structure remains stable.

3. Use the ab_drop() function to drop each block type at their respective positions. Start with the b31 block, followed by the two b13 blocks.

4. Make sure to update the structure grid after each block is dropped. Mark the corresponding positions with the block type to form the desired structure.

Here's an example of how the ab_drop() function can be used to generate a structure resembling the character "J":

```python
# Define the required block types
b31 = 'X'
b13 = 'Y'

# Define the dropping positions for each block type
b31_drop_pos = 4  # Slot number where b31 block's center should be aligned
b13_drop_pos = 5  # Slot number where b13 blocks' centers should be aligned

# Drop the b31 block
ab_drop(b31, b31_drop_pos)

# Update the structure grid after dropping the b31 block
for i in range(3):
    structure[H - 1 - i][b31_drop_pos] = b31

# Drop the first b13 block
ab_drop(b13, b13_drop_pos)

# Update the structure grid after dropping the first b13 block
for i in range(3):
    structure[H - 4 - i][b13_drop_pos] = b13

# Drop the second b13 block
ab_drop(b13, b13_drop_pos+1)

# Update the structure grid after dropping the second b13 block
for i in range(3):
    structure[H - 4 - i][b13_drop_pos+1] = b13

# Print the final structure grid
for row in structure:
    print(row)
```

This code will generate a stable structure resembling the character "J" while meeting all the given constraints.
