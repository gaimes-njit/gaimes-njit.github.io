To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code.

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at slot 0, aligning its center at slot 0.

3. Drop a b31 block at slot 0, aligning its center at slot 2 to provide a solid base for the structure.

4. Drop another b13 block at slot 0, aligning its center at slot 4.

5. Drop a b11 block at slot 5, aligning its center at slot 5.

6. Drop a b13 block at slot 0, aligning its center at slot 6.

7. Now, drop another b13 block at slot 0, aligning its center at slot 10.

8. Finally, drop a b11 block at slot 5, aligning its center at slot 12.

This sequence of block drops will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "K" and satisfies all hard constraints.

To implement this in code, we can use the ab_drop() function to drop each block at the appropriate position. Here is an example implementation:

```python
W = 20  # Map's width
H = 16  # Map's height

# Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # ab_drop() function implementation

# Drop b13 block at slot 0
ab_drop('b13', 0)

# Drop b31 block at slot 0
ab_drop('b31', 2)

# Drop b13 block at slot 0
ab_drop('b13', 4)

# Drop b11 block at slot 5
ab_drop('b11', 5)

# Drop b13 block at slot 0
ab_drop('b13', 6)

# Drop b13 block at slot 0
ab_drop('b13', 10)

# Drop b11 block at slot 5
ab_drop('b11', 12)

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This code will output the resulting structure that resembles the character "K". Make sure to adjust the block positions and order as necessary to meet all stability and boundary constraints.
