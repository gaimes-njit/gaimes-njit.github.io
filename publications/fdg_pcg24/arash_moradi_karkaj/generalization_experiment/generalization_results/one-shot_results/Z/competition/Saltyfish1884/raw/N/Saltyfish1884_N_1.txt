To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place a b11 block as the base of the structure to ensure stability:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

3. Place a b11 block on top of the base to form the vertical section of the character "N":
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

4. Place a b31 block on top of the vertical section to create the horizontal section of the character "N":
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

5. Place a b13 block on top of the horizontal section to complete the character "N":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

The resulting structure should resemble the character "N" and meet the stability constraint. Note that the slot number for dropping blocks may need adjustment depending on the desired position of the structure within the map.

Remember to call the `ab_drop()` function within each step to place the blocks in the desired positions.
