To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "P" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure as an empty grid.
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Place the base blocks.
ab_drop('b11', 6)
ab_drop('b11', 7)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 10)

Step 3: Place the vertical block.
ab_drop('b13', 9)

Step 4: Place the horizontal block on top of the vertical block.
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)

Step 5: Place the horizontal block on top of the previous row.
ab_drop('b31', 7)
ab_drop('b31', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)

Step 6: Print the resulting structure.
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))

The resulting structure will resemble the character "P" and meet all the given requirements.
