To generate a stable structure resembling the character "S", we need to carefully place the blocks according to the given constraints. Here is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid using the provided code:
   `structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]`

2. Place the base blocks (b11 or b13) on the bottom layer (layer 0) to form a solid base. This will provide stability to the structure. For example, you can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop b11 blocks at suitable slots along the bottom layer.

3. Place a b31 block on top of the base blocks. This will serve as the middle section of the "S" character. To ensure stability, the b31 block should be placed directly on top of the base blocks, aligned with the bottom layer. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the b31 block at a suitable slot.

4. Place another b31 block above the previous one, but slightly shifted towards the left or right. This will form the top section of the "S" character. Again, use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the b31 block at a suitable slot.

5. Place two b11 blocks above the b31 blocks to complete the top of the "S" character. These blocks should be aligned with the previous b31 blocks, forming a diagonal shape. Use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the b11 blocks at suitable slots.

6. Finally, you can print the resulting structure using the following code:
   ```
   for row in structure:
       print(' '.join(row))
   ```

Remember to follow the stability rules mentioned in the constraints, ensuring that the blocks are placed on a solid base and as low as possible. Additionally, avoid boundary intrusion by not placing blocks outside the boundaries specified by W and H.

Note: The exact slot positions and order of block placement will depend on the specific arrangement required to form the character "S".
