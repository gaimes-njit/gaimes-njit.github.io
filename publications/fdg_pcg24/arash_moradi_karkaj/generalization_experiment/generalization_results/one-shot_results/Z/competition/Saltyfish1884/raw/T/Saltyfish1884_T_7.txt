To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "T", we can follow these steps:

1. Create the initial empty grid structure.

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Place the base blocks.

```python
for i in range(W):
    ab_drop('b11', i)
```

3. Place the vertical block (b13) in the center of the base.

```python
ab_drop('b13', W // 2)
```

4. Place the horizontal block (b31) on top of the vertical block.

```python
ab_drop('b31', W // 2)
```

5. Print the final structure.

```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The above code will generate a stable structure resembling the character "T" by following the given constraints.
