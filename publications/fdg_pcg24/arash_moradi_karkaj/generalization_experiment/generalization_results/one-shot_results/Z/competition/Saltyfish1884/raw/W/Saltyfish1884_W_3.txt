To generate a structure resembling the character "W" while meeting all the given constraints, we can break it down into several steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure
Start by initializing an empty grid with dimensions W x H using the provided map initialization code.

Step 2: Drop the first b31 block
To ensure stability, we should drop the first b31 block on the base of the structure. Use the ab_drop() function with block type 'b31' and align the block center with slot y = 10 (in the middle of the structure). This will ensure that the block is placed as low as possible.

Step 3: Drop the two b13 blocks on the sides of the b31 block
To form the top parts of the "W", we can use two b13 blocks stacked vertically on the sides of the b31 block. Start by dropping the left b13 block using the ab_drop() function with block type 'b13' and align the block center with slot y = 8. Then, drop the right b13 block with block type 'b13' and align the block center with slot y = 12.

Step 4: Drop the second b31 block on top of the b13 blocks
To create the central part of the "W", we can drop another b31 block on top of the two b13 blocks. Use the ab_drop() function with block type 'b31' and align the block center with slot y = 10.

Step 5: Drop the top b31 block
To complete the structure, we can drop a final b31 block on top of the central b31 block. Use the ab_drop() function with block type 'b31' and align the block center with slot y = 10.

The resulting structure should resemble the character "W" and meet all the given constraints.
