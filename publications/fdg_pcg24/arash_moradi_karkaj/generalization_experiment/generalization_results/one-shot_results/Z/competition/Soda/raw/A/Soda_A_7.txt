To create a structure that looks like the letter "A" in a bottom-to-top fashion, we can break it down into three blocks: a vertical pipe, a middle bar, and a top ticker.

Here's the complete implementation:

```
# Step 1: Place the vertical pipe
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Step 2: Place the middle bar
ab_drop("b31", 9)

# Step 3: Place the top ticker
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Note: The horizontal position (x_position) for all three blocks is set to 9 to align them in the center of the grid. You can adjust this value if you want to move the structure left or right.
