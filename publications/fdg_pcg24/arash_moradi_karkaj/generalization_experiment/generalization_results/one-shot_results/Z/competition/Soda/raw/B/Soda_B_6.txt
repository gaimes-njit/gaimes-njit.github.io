To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital character "B", we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to create the two vertical bars of the letter "B". We can use block_type "b13" to represent each bar.
2. Drop the first vertical bar from the top and center it at x_position = 4. This will occupy cells (3, 0), (4, 0), and (5, 0).
3. Drop the second vertical bar from the top and center it at x_position = 16. This will occupy cells (15, 0), (16, 0), and (17, 0).
4. Lastly, we need to create the horizontal bar of the letter "B". We can use block_type "b31" to represent the bar.
5. Drop the horizontal bar from the top and center it at x_position = 10. This will occupy cells (9, 1), (10, 1), and (11, 1).

The complete implementation to generate the structure that looks like the letter "B" is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 16)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```

This implementation will create the letter "B" structure in the level.
