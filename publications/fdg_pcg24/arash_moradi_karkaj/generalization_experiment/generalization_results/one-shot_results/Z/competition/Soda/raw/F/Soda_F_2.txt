To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "F" in the Tetris game, we can break it down into three blocks - two vertical bars and one horizontal bar. 

Step 1: Place the first vertical bar on the left side of the grid, centered at x_position=2.
```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

Step 2: Place the horizontal bar above the first vertical bar, centered at x_position=3.
```
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

Step 3: Place the second vertical bar on the right side of the grid, centered at x_position=4.
```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

Complete implementation:
```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```
