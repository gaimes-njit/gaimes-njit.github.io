To generate a structure in the shape of the capital letter "I", we can start by placing a row block at the bottom of the grid. We will then stack two column blocks on top of the row block to form the letter "I".

Here is the code implementation:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Centered row block at x position 9
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Stack first column block on top of the row block at x position 9
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Stack second column block on top of the first column block at x position 9
```

This code will drop the blocks in the specified order and positions to form the letter "I" on the grid. The row block will act as the base, and the two column blocks will be stacked on top of it.

This implementation ensures stability by following the bottom-to-top stacking approach. The blocks are dropped in a way that each block is balanced and supported by the block below.

The resulting structure will closely resemble the capital letter "I" when viewed in the natural orientation (top-down).
