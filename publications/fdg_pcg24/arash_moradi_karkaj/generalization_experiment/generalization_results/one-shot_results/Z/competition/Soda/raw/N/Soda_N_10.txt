To create the letter "N", we can start by placing the base of the letter first.

To make the base of the letter "N", we can use the "b31" block. We will place it at the left side of the grid, centered vertically.

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Next, we will add the vertical part of the letter "N". We can also use the "b31" block for this.

```
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Finally, we will add the diagonal part of the letter "N". We will use the "b13" block for this.

```
ab_drop("b13", 15)
```

This will create a structure in the level that looks like the letter "N". The blocks are placed in a bottom-to-top fashion, ensuring stability.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 15)
```
