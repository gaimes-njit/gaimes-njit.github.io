To create the letter "P" in a stable manner, we can start by creating the base of the letter and then stacking the remaining blocks on top. Here is the implementation:

1. Create the base of the letter "P" using a row block (b31) centered at x_position=9:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

2. Place the vertical pipe of the letter "P" using a column block (b13) centered at x_position=9:
```
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

3. Place the top bar of the letter "P" using a row block (b31) centered at x_position=9:
```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Putting it all together, the complete implementation to create the letter "P" in a stable manner is:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
