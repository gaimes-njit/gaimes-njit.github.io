To create a structure that looks like the capital letter "U" in the level, we will need to use a combination of the available block types and drop them in a specific order to achieve stability and similarity.

First, we will start by dropping a row block (b31) at the bottom of the level to form the base of the "U" shape. We will center the row block at position 9 using `ab_drop("b31", 9)`.

Next, we will drop two column blocks (b13) on either side of the row block to form the sides of the "U" shape. We will center each column block at positions 4 and 14 using `ab_drop("b13", 4)` and `ab_drop("b13", 14)`.

Finally, we will drop a row block (b31) on top of the two column blocks to complete the "U" shape. We will center the row block at position 9 using `ab_drop("b31", 9)`.

The complete implementation to generate the "U" shape in the level is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 14)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

This implementation ensures that the blocks are dropped in a bottom-to-top fashion, and the resulting structure resembles the capital letter "U" when viewed from the top-down orientation.
