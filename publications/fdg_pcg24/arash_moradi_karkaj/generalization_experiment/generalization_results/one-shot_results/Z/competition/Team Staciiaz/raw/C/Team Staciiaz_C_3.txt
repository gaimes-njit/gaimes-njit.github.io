To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "C" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in a strategic order and position.

1. Start by dropping a b31 block at slot 2 to create the bottom of the "C" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 2)
```

2. Drop a b11 block at slot 1 to close the loop of the "C" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 1)
```

3. Drop a b31 block at slot 1 above the previous block to create the inner curve of the "C" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

4. Drop a b11 block at slot 0 above the previous block to complete the "C" shape.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 0)
```

By following this order and position of block drops, we can generate a stable structure that looks like the character "C" and meets all the constraints.
