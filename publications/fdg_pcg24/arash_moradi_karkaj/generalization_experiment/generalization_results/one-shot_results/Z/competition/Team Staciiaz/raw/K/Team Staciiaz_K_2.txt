To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "K" and meets all the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks in the appropriate positions.

Based on the character "K" shape, we can start by dropping a b11 block in slot 8, layer 0.

```
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

Next, we can drop a b31 block above the previously dropped block to form the left vertical part of the "K". We can drop this block in slot 7, layer 2.

```
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

Then, we can drop another b31 block adjacent to the previous one to complete the horizontal top part of the "K". We can drop this block in slot 6, layer 2.

```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

Finally, we can drop a b13 block to form the right vertical part of the "K". We can drop this block in slot 9, layer 3.

```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

After executing these functions, the structure will have the shape of the character "K" and will meet all the given constraints.
