To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop the blocks. We need to ensure that the blocks are placed in a way that maintains stability and avoids boundary intrusion.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Start by dropping a `b13` block at the bottom-left corner to form the base of the "L" shape:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

3. To build the vertical part of the "L" shape, drop another `b13` block vertically above the previous block:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

4. To complete the "L" shape, drop a `b31` block horizontally to the right of the previous block:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

5. The resulting structure should resemble the character "L" and meet all the constraints.

Here's the complete code:

```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]

def ab_drop(block_type, x_position):
    # function implementation...

ab_drop('b13', 0)   # Drop the first vertical block for the base
ab_drop('b13', 0)   # Drop the second vertical block to build the vertical part of the "L"
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Drop the horizontal block to complete the "L"

# Print the resulting structure
for row in structure:
    print(''.join(row))
```

This code will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "L" and satisfies the given constraints.
