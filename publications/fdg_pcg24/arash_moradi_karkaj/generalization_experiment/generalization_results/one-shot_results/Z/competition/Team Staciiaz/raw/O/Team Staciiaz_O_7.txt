To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "O" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function in the following steps:

1. Place the bottom horizontal block, "b31", at the center slot 10: `ab_drop("b31", 10)`

2. Place the left vertical block, "b13", at slot 9: `ab_drop("b13", 9)`

3. Place the right vertical block, "b13", at slot 11: `ab_drop("b13", 11)`

4. Place the top horizontal block, "b31", at the center slot 10: `ab_drop("b31", 10)`

This sequence of block placements will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "O" and satisfies all the constraints. The `ab_drop()` function ensures that the blocks are dropped in a way that maintains stability and does not intrude on the boundary of the map.
