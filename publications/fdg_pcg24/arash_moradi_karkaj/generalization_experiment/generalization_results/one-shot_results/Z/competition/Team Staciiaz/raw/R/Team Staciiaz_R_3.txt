To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "R", we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty 20x16 grid using the provided code:
   ```python
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```
2. Start by dropping the lower part of the vertical block 'b13' at the slot position 6 using the `ab_drop()` function:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 6)
   ```
3. Drop the upper part of the vertical block 'b13' at the slot position 6:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 6)
   ```
4. Drop the horizontal block 'b31' at the slot position 4:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 4)
   ```
5. Drop the vertical block 'b13' at the slot position 8:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b13', 8)
   ```
6. Drop the horizontal block 'b31' at the slot position 4:
   ```python
   ab_drop('b31', 4)
   ```

By following these steps, we should be able to generate a stable structure that looks like the character "R" and satisfies the given constraints.
