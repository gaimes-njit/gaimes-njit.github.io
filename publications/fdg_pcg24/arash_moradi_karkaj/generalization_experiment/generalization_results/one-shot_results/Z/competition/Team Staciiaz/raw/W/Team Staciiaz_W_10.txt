To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "W" and meets all the constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty 20x16 grid using the given code:
   ```
   W = 20
   H = 16
   structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. Use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop the blocks in the proper order and position to form the "W" shape.

   2.1. First, drop the top-left "b31" block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

   2.2. Next, drop the top-right "b31" block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

   2.3. Drop the bottom-left "b31" block below the top-left block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 2)
   ```

   2.4. Drop the bottom-right "b31" block below the top-right block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

   2.5. Drop the bottom "b31" block below the two previously dropped blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 6)
   ```

   2.6. Drop the left "b13" block below the bottom-left "b31" block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 0)
   ```

   2.7. Drop the right "b13" block below the bottom-right "b31" block:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 15)
   ```

   2.8. Finally, drop the middle "b11" block between the two "b13" blocks:
   ```
   ab_drop('b11', 7)
   ```

3. After following these steps, the structure should resemble the character "W" and meet the stability constraint. Make sure to adjust the drop positions of the blocks if needed to satisfy the stability constraint.

As for the no boundary intrusion constraint, the given code in the `ab_drop()` function already takes care of this constraint by checking if the drop position is within the valid range (0 to 19) before placing the block.
