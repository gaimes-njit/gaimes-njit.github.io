To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Y" using the `ab_drop()` function and meet all the constraints, we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the base block (`b31`) centered at slot 10:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

3. Drop the two upper arms of the "Y" shape, which are vertical blocks (`b13`), at slots 8 and 12:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
```

4. Drop the lower arm of the "Y" shape, which is a horizontal block (`b31`), centered at slot 10 and one layer above the base:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 10)
```

5. The final structure will look like the character "Y" and meet all the constraints.

The resulting structure will have three blocks, forming the "Y" shape, that are stable and do not intrude on the boundary of the map.

Note: This specific configuration of the blocks is just one possible solution that meets the constraints. There may be other valid configurations that also meet the requirements.
