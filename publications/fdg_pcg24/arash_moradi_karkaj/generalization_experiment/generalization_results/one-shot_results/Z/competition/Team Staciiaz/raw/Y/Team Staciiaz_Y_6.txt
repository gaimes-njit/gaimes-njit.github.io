To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "Y" using the `ab_drop()` function, we need to carefully drop blocks in a specific order to meet the stability constraint. Here is the step-by-step process to generate the structure:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty grid:
```
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. To create the vertical part of the "Y", we will drop a `b13` block at slot 9, layer 1 (0-based index):
```
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

3. To create the two diagonal parts of the "Y", we will drop two `b31` blocks at slots 6 and 12, layer 3:
```
ab_drop('b31', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

4. To create the horizontal part of the "Y", we will drop a `b31` block at slot 9, layer 5:
```
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```

5. The final structure will resemble the character "Y", satisfying all the constraints.

Note: The order in which the blocks are dropped is crucial to maintain stability and meet the constraints. The exact positions and order of drops may vary based on the initial state of the structure and any previously dropped blocks.
