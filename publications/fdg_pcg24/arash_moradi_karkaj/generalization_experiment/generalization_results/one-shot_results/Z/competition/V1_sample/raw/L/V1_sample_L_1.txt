4. Solution

To create the "L" shape structure, we will first drop a b13 block from layer 15 with its center at slot 4. This will represent the vertical part of the "L" shape.

Next, we will drop a b31 block from layer 12 with its center at slot 4. This will represent the horizontal part of the "L" shape.

Finally, we will drop a b11 block from layer 4 with its center at slot 4. This will serve as the bottom part of the "L" shape.

By following these steps and dropping the blocks in the correct order and position, we can create a stable structure that resembles the "L" shape.
