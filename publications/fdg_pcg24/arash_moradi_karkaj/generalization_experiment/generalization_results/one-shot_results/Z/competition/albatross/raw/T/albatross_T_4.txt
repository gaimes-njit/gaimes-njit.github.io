To construct a level for Science Birds that resembles the letter "T" while satisfying all the constraints, the following code sequence using the `ab_drop()` function can be used:

ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 9)

Explanation:
- The first `ab_drop('b31', 9)` drops a horizontal block ('b31') centered at slot 9 to form the crossbar of the "T".
- The second `ab_drop('b13', 9)` drops a vertical block ('b13') centered at slot 9 to form the stem of the "T".
- The third `ab_drop('b11', 9)` drops a square block ('b11') centered at slot 9 to complete the top of the "T".

This code sequence ensures that the structure represents the letter "T" while maintaining stability under gravity and satisfying all the constraints of the Science Birds game.
