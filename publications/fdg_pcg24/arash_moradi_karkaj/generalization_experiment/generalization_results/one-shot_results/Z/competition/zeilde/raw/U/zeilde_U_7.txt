Steps:
1. Drawing the letter "U" with asterisks:
```
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****
```

2. Verbal list of asterisks and spaces in each row:
- Row 1: Five asterisks
- Row 2: One asterisk, three spaces, one asterisk
- Row 3: One asterisk, three spaces, one asterisk
- Row 4: One asterisk, three spaces, one asterisk
- Row 5: Five asterisks

3. Changing asterisks to "x" and spaces to "y":
- Row 1: Five "x"
- Row 2: One "x", three "y", one "x"
- Row 3: One "x", three "y", one "x"
- Row 4: One "x", three "y", one "x"
- Row 5: Five "x"

4. Writing out "x" and "y" for each row:
- Row 1: "xxxxx"
- Row 2: "xyyyx"
- Row 3: "xyyyx"
- Row 4: "xyyyx"
- Row 5: "xxxxx"

5. Indicating the position of each variable:
- Row 1: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5"
- Row 2: "x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; x-5"
- Row 3: "x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; x-5"
- Row 4: "x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; x-5"
- Row 5: "x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5"

6. Returning a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
```
