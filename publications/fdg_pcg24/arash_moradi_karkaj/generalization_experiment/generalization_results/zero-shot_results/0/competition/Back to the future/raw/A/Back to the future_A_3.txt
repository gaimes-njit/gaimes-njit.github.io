To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "A" and meets all the hard constraints, you can use the `ab_drop()` function as follows:

1. First, initialize the structure as an empty grid using the `structure` variable:
   ```
   structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
   ```

2. To create the bottom b31 block of the "A", use the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b31 block with its center aligned at slot 9. This will ensure stability and meet the hard constraint.
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

3. Next, to create the top b31 block of the "A", use the `ab_drop()` function to drop another b31 block with its center aligned at slot 9, but this time on layer 1. This will ensure stability and meet the hard constraint. 
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 9)
   ```

4. To create the diagonal b13 block of the "A", use the `ab_drop()` function to drop a b13 block with its center aligned at slot 9, but this time on layer 2. This will ensure stability and meet the hard constraint.
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 9)
   ```

5. Repeat steps 2-4 to create additional layers of the diagonal b13 block until the desired height of the "A" is reached. Make sure to adjust the layer number accordingly.

By following these steps and carefully selecting the drop positions and orders, you can generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase letter "A" and meets all the hard constraints.
