To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure grid using the provided code:
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Determine the dropping positions for each block type according to the block-stacking problem.

3. Drop the blocks using the `ab_drop()` function and update the structure grid.

4. Check the stability of the structure after each drop to ensure it doesn't collapse.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire structure is built.

Here is a possible implementation of this approach:

```python
# Initialize the structure grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# Define the block types
b11 = '◼️'
b31 = '▲'
b13 = '▼'

# Define the constraints
def stability_check(drop_pos):
    # Check stability of the structure after dropping a block
    if drop_pos[0] == H-1 or structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
        return True
    return False

def boundary_check(drop_pos):
    # Check if the block intrudes on the boundary
    if drop_pos[1] < 0 or drop_pos[1] >= W:
        return False
    return True

# Helper function to print the structure
def print_structure(structure):
    for row in structure:
        print(' '.join(row))
    print()

# Drop the blocks to generate the structure
# Step 1: Drop first b13 block
drop_pos = (14, 4)
if stability_check(drop_pos) and boundary_check(drop_pos):
    ab_drop(b13, drop_pos[1])
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = b13

# Step 2: Drop second b13 block
drop_pos = (12, 4)
if stability_check(drop_pos) and boundary_check(drop_pos):
    ab_drop(b13, drop_pos[1])
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = b13

# Step 3: Drop b31 block
drop_pos = (11, 2)
if stability_check(drop_pos) and boundary_check(drop_pos):
    ab_drop(b31, drop_pos[1])
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = b31

# Step 4: Drop b11 block
drop_pos = (11, 3)
if stability_check(drop_pos) and boundary_check(drop_pos):
    ab_drop(b11, drop_pos[1])
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = b11

# Print the final structure
print_structure(structure)
```

This code represents a possible solution for generating a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "D". Note that this is just an example and the specific dropping positions and block types may vary depending on the desired shape and diversity of the structure.
