To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "H" and meets all the hard constraints, we need to carefully drop and stack the blocks in a specific order and position. Here is a possible implementation using the `ab_drop()` function:

1. First, we start by initializing the structure as an empty grid:

```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Next, we can start dropping and stacking the blocks. We'll follow a step-by-step process to ensure stability and meet the constraints:

Step 1: Drop the base block (b13):
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop the b13 block at slot 9
```

Step 2: Drop the two vertical blocks (b13) to form the vertical lines of the "H":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 6)  # Drop the first b13 block at slot 6
ab_drop('b13', 12)  # Drop the second b13 block at slot 12
```

Step 3: Drop the horizontal block (b31) to connect the vertical lines:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)  # Drop the b31 block at slot 9
```

That's it! After following these steps, the structure should resemble the uppercase character "H". The coordinates of each `ab_drop()` call can be recorded to ensure the stability and build a similar structure each time.

Note: The actual placement and order of the blocks might vary slightly depending on the specific rules and conditions of the block-stacking problem. This is just one example solution to meet the given goal and constraints.
