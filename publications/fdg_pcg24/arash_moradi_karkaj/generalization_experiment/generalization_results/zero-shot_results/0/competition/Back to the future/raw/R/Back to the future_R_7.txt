To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "R" and satisfies all the hard constraints, we need to carefully plan where to drop each block to ensure stability and meet the desired shape.

Here is a step-by-step solution using the `ab_drop()` function:

1. Drop the b13 block at coordinates (12, 9) to form the vertical leg of the "R".
   ab_drop("b13", 9)
   
2. Drop the b31 block at coordinates (11, 9) to form the horizontal base of the "R".
   ab_drop("b31", 9)

3. Drop the b11 block at coordinates (10, 9) to close the gap in the "R".
   ab_drop("b11", 9)

4. Drop the b13 block at coordinates (10, 7) to form the diagonal leg of the "R".
   ab_drop("b13", 7)

5. Drop the b31 block at coordinates (9, 7) to form the diagonal top part of the "R".
   ab_drop("b31", 7)

6. Drop the b11 block at coordinates (8, 7) to close the gap in the diagonal part of the "R".
   ab_drop("b11", 7)

The resulting structure will be a stable "R" shape.
