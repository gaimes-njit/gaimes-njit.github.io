To generate a stable structure that looks like the uppercase character "V" and meets all the hard constraints, we can follow a step-by-step approach:

1. Determine the appropriate dropping positions and order by analyzing the stability of the structure.
2. Use `ab_drop()` function to drop the blocks at the determined positions and update the structure accordingly.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the entire structure is built.
4. Perform stability checks before each call to `ab_drop()` to ensure the structure remains stable.
5. Ensure that the structure resembles the uppercase character "V" by arranging the blocks in a similar shape.
6. Consider the soft constraint of not intruding on the boundary of the map while placing the blocks.
7. Generate diverse structures by varying the dropping positions and order.

Here is a possible implementation:

```python
import random

# Constants
W = 20  # Number of slots
H = 16  # Number of layers

# Initialize the structure as an empty grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

def check_stability(x, y):
    # Check if the structure will remain stable after dropping block x at slot y
    if x == 'b11':
        # Check stability for a square block
        if structure[H-2][y] != ' ':
            return True
    elif x == 'b31':
        # Check stability for a horizontal block
        if structure[H-2][y] != ' ' and structure[H-2][y-1] != ' ' and structure[H-2][y+1] != ' ':
            return True
    elif x == 'b13':
        # Check stability for a vertical block
        if structure[H-4][y] != ' ' and structure[H-3][y] != ' ':
            return True
    return False

def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Drop block x with its center aligned at slot y
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # Move the block down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # Place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x
    return drop_pos

def generate_structure():
    # Drop the first block at a random slot
    x = random.choice(['b11', 'b31', 'b13'])
    y = random.randint(2, 17)  # Avoid boundary intrusion
    ab_drop(x, y)
    positions = [(x, y)]
    
    while True:
        # Check stability and determine the dropping position for the next block
        new_x = random.choice(['b11', 'b31', 'b13'])
        new_y = random.randint(2, 17)  # Avoid boundary intrusion
        
        if check_stability(new_x, new_y):
            ab_drop(new_x, new_y)
            positions.append((new_x, new_y))
            
            # Check if the structure is complete
            if len(positions) >= 5:
                # Check if the structure resembles the uppercase "V"
                if positions[2][1] == positions[3][1] == positions[4][1] and positions[2][0] == 'b31':
                    break
        
    return positions

# Generate a stable structure
positions = generate_structure()

# Print the structure
for layer in structure:
    print(' '.join(layer))

# Print the coordinates of each dropped block
print("Dropped blocks' coordinates:")
for i, (x, y) in enumerate(positions):
    print(f"{i+1}. ({x}, {y})")
```

This implementation randomly selects dropping positions while ensuring stability and avoiding boundary intrusion. It also checks if the generated structure resembles the uppercase "V" by checking the positions of specific blocks. The program then prints the final structure and the coordinates of each dropped block.
