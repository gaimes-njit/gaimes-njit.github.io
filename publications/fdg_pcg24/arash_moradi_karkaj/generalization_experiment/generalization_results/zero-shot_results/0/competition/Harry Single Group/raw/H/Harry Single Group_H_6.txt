To generate the letter "H" shape using the provided function, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize the field by creating a 2-dimensional array with dimensions 20x16, representing the 320 cells.

2. Create a horizontal brick (b31) at the bottom of the field by calling ab_drop('b31', 8).

3. Create a vertical brick (b13) above the previous brick by calling ab_drop('b13', 8).

4. Create another horizontal brick (b31) above the previous vertical brick by calling ab_drop('b31', 8).

The code to generate the required structure is as follows:

```
# Step 1: Initialize the field
field = [[' ' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]

# Step 2: Create the first horizontal brick
ab_drop('b31', 8)

# Step 3: Create the vertical brick above the previous brick
ab_drop('b13', 8)

# Step 4: Create the second horizontal brick above the vertical brick
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

This code will generate the letter "H" shape on the field, satisfying the stability and boundary collision requirements.
