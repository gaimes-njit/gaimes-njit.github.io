To form a shape resembling the letter "I" using the available props and the ab_drop(x, y) function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the field:
```python
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

2. Place the b13 brick:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 8)
```

3. Place the b11 brick on top of the b13 brick:
```python
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

4. Check the stability of the structure:
- Count the number of occupied cells on the left and right sides of the pivot (x_position = 8). If they are equal, the structure is stable.

The completed code, separated from the analysis, would look like this:

```python
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # Implementation of the ab_drop function
    pass

field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 8)
```

By following these steps, we should be able to generate a stable structure resembling the letter "I" using the available props and the provided ab_drop(x, y) function.
