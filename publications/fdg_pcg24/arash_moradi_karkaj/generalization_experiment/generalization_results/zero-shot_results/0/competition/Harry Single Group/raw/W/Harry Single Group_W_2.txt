To form the letter "W" shape using the given bricks, we can break it down into multiple steps:

Step 1: Initialize the field map with all cells set to 0 (unoccupied).
```
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]
```

Step 2: Place the two vertical bricks (b13) on the left and right sides of the field.
```
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the left vertical brick
ab_drop('b13', 17)  # Place the right vertical brick
```
Now, the cells (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2) and (17, 0), (17, 1), (17, 2) are occupied.

Step 3: Place the horizontal brick (b31) to form the middle part of the "W" shape.
```
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the bottom part of the middle brick
ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Place the middle part of the middle brick
ab_drop('b31', 11) # Place the top part of the middle brick
```
Now, the cells (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 0), (13, 0) are occupied.

Step 4: Adjust the top part of the middle brick to form the "W" shape.
```
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Place the first square brick above the middle brick
ab_drop('b11', 14)  # Place the second square brick above the middle brick
```
Now, the cells (9, 1) and (14, 1) are occupied.

The final structure will resemble the letter "W" and satisfy the stability and boundary collision requirements.

```python
# Initialize the field map
field = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(16)]

# Place the two vertical bricks
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the left vertical brick
ab_drop('b13', 17)  # Place the right vertical brick

# Place the horizontal brick
ab_drop('b31', 5)  # Place the bottom part of the middle brick
ab_drop('b31', 8)  # Place the middle part of the middle brick
ab_drop('b31', 11) # Place the top part of the middle brick

# Adjust the top part of the middle brick
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Place the first square brick above the middle brick
ab_drop('b11', 14)  # Place the second square brick above the middle brick
```
