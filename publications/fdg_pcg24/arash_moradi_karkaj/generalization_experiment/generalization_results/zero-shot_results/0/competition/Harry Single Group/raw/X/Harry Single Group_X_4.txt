First, let's initialize the field as a 2-dimensional array of size 16x20, representing the cells of the field:

```python
field = [[' ' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(16)]
```

Now, we can start generating the structure resembling the letter "X". We will follow a step-by-step approach to ensure stability and avoid boundary collisions.

Step 1: Place the b13 brick at the bottom-right corner of the field:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 19)
```

Step 2: Place the b31 brick right above the b13 brick, with its center aligned to the center of b13:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 18)
```

Step 3: Place the b13 brick at the bottom-left corner of the field:
```python
ab_drop('b13', 0)
```

Step 4: Place the b31 brick right above the b13 brick, with its center aligned to the center of b13:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

After executing these steps, the field will contain the structure resembling the letter "X".
