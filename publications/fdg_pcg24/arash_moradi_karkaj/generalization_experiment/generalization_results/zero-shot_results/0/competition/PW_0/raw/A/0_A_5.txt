The target letter is "A". To achieve this, we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "A" within the defined environment, while following the stacking and stability rules.
