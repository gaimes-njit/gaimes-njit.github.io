To create the uppercase English letter "A" using the given block types and gravity rules, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
```

Explanation:
- We first place a 1x1 square block ("b11") at position 5 to form the left side of the letter "A".
- Then, we place a horizontal straight block ("b31") at position 3 to form the horizontal line segment of the letter "A".
- Next, we place a vertical straight block ("b13") at position 4, repeated three times, to form the right side of the letter "A".
- Finally, we place another horizontal straight block ("b31") at position 7 to complete the horizontal line segment of the letter "A".

This sequence of commands will result in the formation of the uppercase English letter "A" within the defined environment while maintaining stability with regard to the gravity rules.
