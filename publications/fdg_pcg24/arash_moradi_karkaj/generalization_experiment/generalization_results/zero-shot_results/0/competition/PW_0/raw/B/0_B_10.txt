To create the uppercase letter "B", we can divide the task into two parts - creating the two vertical straight blocks and the horizontal straight block in the middle. 

First, we will create the two vertical straight blocks (b13) on either side. We will start from the top-left corner and place the blocks consecutively downwards.

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

Next, we will create the horizontal straight block (b31) in the middle of the letter. We will place it just below the top of the vertical blocks.

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```

Putting it all together, the stream of commands to create the uppercase letter "B" would be:

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)

ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
```
