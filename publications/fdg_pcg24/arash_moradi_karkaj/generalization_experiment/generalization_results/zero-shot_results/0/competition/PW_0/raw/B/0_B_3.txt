Here is the stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "B":

```python
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place the first horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Place the second horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place the square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place the square block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop("b31", 9)  # Place the third horizontal straight block at position 9
ab_drop("b31", 12)  # Place the fourth horizontal straight block at position 12
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place the third vertical straight block at position 9
ab_drop("b11", 9)  # Place the square block at position 9
ab_drop("b11", 9)  # Place the square block at position 9
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place the fourth vertical straight block at position 9
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "B" in the Tetris-like environment, ensuring structural stability and following the gravity rules.
