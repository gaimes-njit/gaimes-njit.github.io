To generate the uppercase letter "B", you can use the following stream of commands using the ab_drop() function:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

This sequence of commands will create a letter "B" shape within the allowed space boundaries, with proper stacking and stability according to the gravity rules.
