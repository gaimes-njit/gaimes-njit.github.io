Here is a possible solution to generate the uppercase English letter "C" using the ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
```

This solution starts by placing two horizontal straight blocks of width 3 units (b31) at positions 1 and 2 along the width. Then it places two vertical straight blocks of height 3 units (b13) at position 1 to create the curve of the letter "C". Finally, it places three more horizontal straight blocks of width 3 units (b31) at position 1 to complete the rest of the letter.
