The objective is to generate the uppercase English letter "C" using the given block types and following the gravity rules in the specified environment. Here's one possible solution:

```
ab_drop("b11",1)
ab_drop("b31",1)
ab_drop("b31",2)
ab_drop("b31",3)
ab_drop("b31",1)
ab_drop("b31",3)
ab_drop("b31",1)
ab_drop("b31",2)
ab_drop("b31",3)
ab_drop("b11",4)
```

In this solution, we start by placing a 1x1 square block in the first position to create the top-left corner of the letter "C". Then, we use the horizontal straight block to create the top edge of the "C", followed by two vertical straight blocks to create the right side of the "C". We repeat the process with the horizontal block to create the bottom edge of the "C". Finally, we place another 1x1 square block to complete the bottom-right corner of the "C".
