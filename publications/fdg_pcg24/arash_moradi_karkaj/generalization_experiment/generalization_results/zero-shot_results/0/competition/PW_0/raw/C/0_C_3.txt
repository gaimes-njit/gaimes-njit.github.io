To create the uppercase letter "C" using the given block types and gravity rules, the following stream of ab_drop() commands should be used:

```
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 6)
```

This sequence of commands will construct a stable and accurate representation of the uppercase letter "C" within the allowed space boundaries.
