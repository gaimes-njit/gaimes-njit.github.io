To generate the uppercase English letter "C" in the given environment, we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

Explanation:
- Place three vertical straight blocks ('b13') consecutively in the first column to form the left side of the letter "C".
- Place two horizontal straight blocks ('b31') in the second and third columns to form the top part of the letter "C".
- Place three vertical straight blocks ('b13') consecutively in the fifth column to form the right side of the letter "C".

Please note that the stream of commands assumes the starting position is at the top-left corner of the grid (position 1) and proceeds horizontally.
