To create the uppercase letter "C", we can use the following commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place the first block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Place the second block at position 4
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Place the third block at position 5
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place the fourth block at position 1
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "C" using the block types and within the defined environment, while ensuring stacking and stability.
