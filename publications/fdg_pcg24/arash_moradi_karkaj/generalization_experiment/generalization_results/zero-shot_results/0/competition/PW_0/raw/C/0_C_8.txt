To create the uppercase English letter "C" using the given block types and the defined environment, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Explanation:
- Place two horizontal straight blocks (b31) at positions 1 and 2 to create the top and bottom parts of the letter "C".
- Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 3 to create the middle part of the letter "C".
- Place two vertical straight blocks (b13) at positions 1 and 2 to complete the letter "C".

Please note that the backticks (```) used in the example are not part of the actual commands and are used solely for formatting purposes.
