To generate the uppercase English letter "D", we can break it down into different parts using the available block types:

1. Start by placing a b31 block at position (1, 1) to create the vertical stroke of the letter D:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```

2. Next, place a b13 block at position (4, 1) to create the upper horizontal stroke of the letter D:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

3. Now, place a b13 block at position (4, 4) to create the lower horizontal stroke of the letter D:
```
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

4. Finally, place a b31 block at position (7, 1) to close the letter D:
```
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

The complete stream of commands to generate the letter D would be:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```
