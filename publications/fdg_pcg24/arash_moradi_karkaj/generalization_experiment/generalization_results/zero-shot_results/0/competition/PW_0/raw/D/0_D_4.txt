To create the uppercase letter D, we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Place a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop("b11", 5)  # Place a square block at position 5
ab_drop("b11", 5)  # Place a square block at position 5
ab_drop("b11", 5)  # Place a square block at position 5
ab_drop("b11", 5)  # Place a square block at position 5
ab_drop("b11", 6)  # Place a square block at position 6
ab_drop("b11", 6)  # Place a square block at position 6
ab_drop("b11", 6)  # Place a square block at position 6
ab_drop("b11", 6)  # Place a square block at position 6
```

These commands will create a stable representation of the uppercase letter D within the defined environment.
