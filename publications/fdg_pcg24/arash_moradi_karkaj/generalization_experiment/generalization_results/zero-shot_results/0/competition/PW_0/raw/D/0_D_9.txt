To create the uppercase letter D using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to create the upper and lower parts of the letter D using blocks b31 and b13.

2. Place a b31 block horizontally at position 1 to create the top part of the letter D. Use the following command:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 1)
   ```

3. Place a b13 block vertically at position 1 to create the left vertical part of the letter D. Use the following command:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 1)
   ```

4. Place another b31 block horizontally at position 4 to create the middle horizontal part of the letter D. Use the following command:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 4)
   ```

5. Place a b13 block vertically at position 4 to create the right vertical part of the letter D. Use the following command:
   ```
   ab_drop('b13', 4)
   ```

6. Finally, place a b31 block horizontally at position 7 to complete the bottom part of the letter D. Use the following command:
   ```
   ab_drop('b31', 7)
   ```

Here is the complete stream of commands to create the uppercase letter D:
```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```
