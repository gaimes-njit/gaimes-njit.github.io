To create the uppercase letter "E" using the block types provided in the defined environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b11 block at position (1, 1) to form the top-left corner of the letter E.
2. Place a b31 block at position (2, 1) to form the horizontal line of the letter E.
3. Place a b11 block at position (2, 4) to form the middle part of the letter E.
4. Place a b13 block at position (3, 1) to form the vertical line of the letter E.
5. Place a b13 block at position (3, 4) to form the vertical line of the letter E.
6. Place a b11 block at position (4, 1) to form the bottom-left corner of the letter E.
7. Place a b31 block at position (4, 3) to form the horizontal line of the letter E.
8. Place a b11 block at position (4, 4) to form the bottom-right corner of the letter E.

ab_drop('b11', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
