Here is a possible solution to generate the uppercase English letter "E":

```
ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 4

ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4

ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 4

ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 4

ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 4

ab_drop('b11', 1)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 3)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 3
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place a 1x1 block at position 4
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "E" in the given environment by stacking and placing the blocks according to the gravity rules.
