To create the uppercase letter "E", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop(b31, 1)
ab_drop(b11, 2)
ab_drop(b11, 2)
ab_drop(b11, 2)
ab_drop(b13, 2)
ab_drop(b11, 3)
ab_drop(b11, 3)
ab_drop(b11, 3)
ab_drop(b31, 4)
ab_drop(b31, 4)
ab_drop(b31, 4)
ab_drop(b11, 5)
ab_drop(b11, 5)
ab_drop(b11, 5)
ab_drop(b31, 6)
ab_drop(b11, 7)
ab_drop(b11, 7)
ab_drop(b11, 7)
```

Explanation of the commands:

- First, we drop a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to create the top horizontal line of the letter "E".
- Then, we drop three 1x1 square blocks (b11) at position 2 to create the three vertical lines.
- Next, we drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2 to create the middle horizontal line of the letter "E".
- After that, we drop three 1x1 square blocks (b11) at position 3 to complete the middle vertical line.
- Then, we drop three horizontal straight blocks (b31) at position 4 to create the bottom horizontal line of the letter "E".
- Finally, we drop three 1x1 square blocks (b11) at position 5 to complete the bottom vertical line.

By following these commands, we should be able to create the uppercase letter "E" within the defined environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
