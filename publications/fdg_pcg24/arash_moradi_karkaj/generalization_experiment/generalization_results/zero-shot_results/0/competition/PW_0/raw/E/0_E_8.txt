To create the uppercase letter "E" using the given block types, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

This stream of commands will place the blocks in the Tetris-like environment to form the letter "E", while adhering to the gravity rules and space boundaries.
