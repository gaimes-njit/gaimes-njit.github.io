To create uppercase letter "E", we can break it down into three parts: the vertical line in the center, the two horizontal lines on top and bottom, and the two diagonal lines in between. 

Here are the commands to create each part:

1. Vertical line in the center:
```
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
```

2. Horizontal line on top:
```
ab_drop(b31, 2)
ab_drop(b31, 3)
ab_drop(b31, 4)
ab_drop(b31, 5)
ab_drop(b31, 6)
ab_drop(b31, 7)
ab_drop(b31, 8)
ab_drop(b31, 9)
ab_drop(b31, 10)
ab_drop(b31, 11)
ab_drop(b31, 12)
ab_drop(b31, 13)
ab_drop(b31, 14)
ab_drop(b31, 15)
```

3. Horizontal line on bottom:
```
ab_drop(b31, 2)
ab_drop(b31, 3)
ab_drop(b31, 4)
ab_drop(b31, 5)
ab_drop(b31, 6)
ab_drop(b31, 7)
ab_drop(b31, 8)
ab_drop(b31, 9)
ab_drop(b31, 10)
ab_drop(b31, 11)
ab_drop(b31, 12)
ab_drop(b31, 13)
ab_drop(b31, 14)
ab_drop(b31, 15)
```

4. Diagonal lines in between:
```
ab_drop(b11, 2)
ab_drop(b11, 3)
ab_drop(b11, 4)
ab_drop(b11, 5)
ab_drop(b11, 6)
ab_drop(b11, 7)
ab_drop(b11, 8)
ab_drop(b11, 9)
ab_drop(b11, 10)
ab_drop(b11, 11)
ab_drop(b11, 12)
ab_drop(b11, 13)
ab_drop(b11, 14)
ab_drop(b11, 15)
```

Combine all the commands, and you will have a stream of ab_drop() commands that create an uppercase "E" in the given environment.
