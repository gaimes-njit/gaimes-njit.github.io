To create the uppercase letter "F", you can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the second vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Place the third vertical block at position 2
ab_drop('b13', 3)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 3
```

This sequence of commands will construct the letter "F" while maintaining stability with regard to the gravity rules.
