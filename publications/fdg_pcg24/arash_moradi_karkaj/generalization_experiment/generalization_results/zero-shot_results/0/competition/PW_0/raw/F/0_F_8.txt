To generate the uppercase letter "F" using the given block types, follow the stream of ab_drop() commands below:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place the horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 2)  # Place the square block on top of the horizontal block
ab_drop("b11", 3)  # Place another square block on top of the previous block
ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Place the vertical block next to the horizontal block
```

This will generate the letter "F" in the Tetris-like environment with 2D gravity rules. Ensure that each command is executed consecutively and that the blocks are placed within the allowed space boundaries.
