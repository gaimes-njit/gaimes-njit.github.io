To construct the uppercase letter "G", we can break it down into three parts: the horizontal bar at the top, the vertical bar in the middle, and the curve at the bottom.

Here is the stream of commands to construct the letter "G":

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the horizontal bar at the top
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)

ab_drop('b13', 2)  # Place the vertical bar in the middle
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 2)

ab_drop('b11', 3)  # Place the curve at the bottom
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
ab_drop('b31', 6)
```

This sequence of commands will construct the uppercase letter "G" using the given block types and following the gravity rules in the defined environment.
