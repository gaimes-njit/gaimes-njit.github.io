To generate the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types, we can break it down into three parts: the two vertical lines and the horizontal line in the middle. 

First, we can start by placing two vertical blocks using the b13 block type. Since both vertical lines are of the same height, we can place them consecutively. 

```cmd
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

Next, we need to place the horizontal line in the middle using the b31 block type. To ensure stability, we can place it just below the two vertical blocks.

```cmd
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```

With these commands, we have successfully generated the uppercase letter "H" using the block types provided. The final set of commands is as follows:

```cmd
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
```
