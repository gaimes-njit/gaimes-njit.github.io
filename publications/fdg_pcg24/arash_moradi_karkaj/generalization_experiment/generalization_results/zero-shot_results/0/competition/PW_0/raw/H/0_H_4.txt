To generate the uppercase letter "H" using the given block types, we can break it down into three parts: a vertical straight block in the middle and two horizontal straight blocks on the top and bottom.

Here are the commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Place the vertical straight block on the left side
ab_drop('b13', 19)  # Place the vertical straight block on the right side
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place the top horizontal straight block (again to make it wider)
