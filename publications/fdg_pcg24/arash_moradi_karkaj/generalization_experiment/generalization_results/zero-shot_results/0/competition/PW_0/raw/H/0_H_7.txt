To create an uppercase letter "H" using the given block types and following the gravity rules, you can use the following set of commands:

```
ab_drop(b11,1)
ab_drop(b11,5)
ab_drop(b11,9)
ab_drop(b11,13)
ab_drop(b31,2)
ab_drop(b31,3)
ab_drop(b31,4)
ab_drop(b31,5)
ab_drop(b31,6)
ab_drop(b31,7)
ab_drop(b31,8)
ab_drop(b13,4)
ab_drop(b13,5)
ab_drop(b13,6)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a 1x1 square block in the first column at height 1 (ab_drop(b11,1)).
2. Place a 1x1 square block in the fifth column at height 1 (ab_drop(b11,5)).
3. Place a 1x1 square block in the ninth column at height 1 (ab_drop(b11,9)).
4. Place a 1x1 square block in the thirteenth column at height 1 (ab_drop(b11,13)).
5. Place a horizontal straight block in the second column starting from height 1 (ab_drop(b31,2)).
6. Repeat step 5 until the eighth column to create the top bar of the "H".
7. Place a vertical straight block in the fourth column starting from height 1 (ab_drop(b13,4)).
8. Repeat step 7 until the sixth column to create the vertical line of the "H".

This set of commands will construct the uppercase letter "H" in the Tetris-like environment while maintaining structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
