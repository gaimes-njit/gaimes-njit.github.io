To generate the uppercase letter "I" using the given block types and gravity rules, the following sequence of ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Explanation:
- The first command `ab_drop("b31", 1)` places a horizontal straight block at position 1.
- The next six commands `ab_drop("b13", 2)` place vertical straight blocks at position 2, creating the vertical line of the letter "I".
- The last command `ab_drop("b31", 1)` places another horizontal straight block at position 1 to complete the top of the letter "I".

This sequence of commands will generate the uppercase letter "I" in the Tetris-like environment, following the given gravity rules.
