Explanation:
- To construct the uppercase letter "I", we start by placing a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1. This represents the top line of the letter.
- Next, we place three vertical straight blocks (b13) starting from position 2. These blocks represent the vertical lines of the letter.
- Finally, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 3 to complete the bottom line of the letter.
