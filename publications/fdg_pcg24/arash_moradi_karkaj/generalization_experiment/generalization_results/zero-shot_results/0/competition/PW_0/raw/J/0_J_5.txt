To create the uppercase letter "J", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

Explanation:
- First, we drop a single square block ("b11") at position (1, 1) to form the top of the letter "J".
- Next, we drop a horizontal straight block ("b31") at position (1, 1) to form the stem of the letter "J".
- We then drop another horizontal straight block ("b31") at position (4, 1) to extend the stem.
- Next, we drop a vertical straight block ("b13") at position (4, 4) to form the right side of the letter "J".
- We continue to drop vertical straight blocks ("b13") at positions (3, 4), (2, 4), and (1, 4) to complete the right side of the letter "J".
- Finally, we have successfully created the uppercase letter "J" using the available block types and following the gravity rules.
