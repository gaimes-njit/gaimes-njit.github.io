To create the uppercase letter "J", we will use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Explanation:
- The first three commands (ab_drop("b13", 1), ab_drop("b13", 2), ab_drop("b13", 3)) create the vertical line of the letter "J".
- The last command (ab_drop("b31", 1)) creates the horizontal line at the bottom of the letter "J".

Please ensure that the commands are executed consecutively and the blocks are placed according to the specified positions to accurately represent the uppercase letter "J".
