The command to generate the uppercase English letter "J" using the mentioned block types in the defined environment is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
```

Explanation:
- The first three "b31" blocks are placed horizontally at positions 1, 4, and 7 along the width to form the top part of the letter "J".
- Then, four "b13" blocks are placed vertically at position 9 along the width to form the vertical stem of the letter "J".

Please note that the above commands are just an example and can be modified to achieve similar results. The main objective is to place the blocks in a way that accurately represents the letter "J" and ensures structural stability within the defined environment.
