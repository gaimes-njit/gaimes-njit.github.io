First, let's position the left vertical line of the "K" shape. We will use the b13 block type.

```
ab_drop(b13, 1)  // Drop the first block of the left vertical line at position 1
ab_drop(b13, 1)  // Drop the second block of the left vertical line at position 1
ab_drop(b13, 1)  // Drop the third block of the left vertical line at position 1
```

Next, let's position the horizontal line of the "K" shape. We will use the b31 block type.

```
ab_drop(b31, 2)  // Drop the first block of the horizontal line at position 2
ab_drop(b31, 3)  // Drop the second block of the horizontal line at position 3
ab_drop(b31, 4)  // Drop the third block of the horizontal line at position 4
```

Finally, let's position the right vertical line of the "K" shape. We will again use the b13 block type.

```
ab_drop(b13, 5)  // Drop the first block of the right vertical line at position 5
ab_drop(b13, 5)  // Drop the second block of the right vertical line at position 5
ab_drop(b13, 5)  // Drop the third block of the right vertical line at position 5
```

The final result should be the uppercase English letter "K" formed using the mentioned command and block types in the defined environment.
