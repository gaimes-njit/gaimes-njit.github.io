To create the uppercase letter "K" using the given block types and gravity rules, you need to strategically place the blocks in the correct positions. Here is the solution:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b13', 1)   # Place a vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 3)   # Place another vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place another horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 4)   # Place a 1x1 square block at position 4
```

By following these commands, you will be able to create the uppercase English letter "K" in the defined grid.
