To create the capital letter "K" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b31 block at position (1, 1) to create the left vertical stroke of the "K" shape.
2. Place a b13 block at position (4, 1) to create the horizontal stroke of the "K" shape.
3. Place a b13 block at position (4, 4) to create the right vertical stroke of the "K" shape.

The stream of commands to achieve this is as follows:

```
ab_drop(31, 1)
ab_drop(13, 4)
ab_drop(13, 4)
```

Make sure to execute these commands consecutively, one by one. The resulting shape will resemble the capital letter "K" within the allowed space boundaries of the grid.
