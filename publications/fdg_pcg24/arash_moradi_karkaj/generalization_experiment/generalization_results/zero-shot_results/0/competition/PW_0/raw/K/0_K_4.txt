To create the letter "K" using the given block types in the defined environment, we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Place the vertical block below the first block at position 4
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Place another horizontal block next to the vertical block at position 4
ab_drop("b13", 7)  # Place another vertical block below the second horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop("b31", 7)  # Place another horizontal block next to the vertical block at position 7
ab_drop("b31", 10)  # Place one more horizontal block next to the previous one at position 10
```

These commands will sequentially place the block types to form the letter "K" while ensuring stability with the defined gravity rules and staying within the allowed space boundaries.
