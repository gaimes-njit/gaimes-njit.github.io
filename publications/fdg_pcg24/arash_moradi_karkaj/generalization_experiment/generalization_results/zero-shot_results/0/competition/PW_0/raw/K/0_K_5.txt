The stream of ab_drop() commands to generate the uppercase letter "K" is as follows:

```
ab_drop(b31, 1)
ab_drop(b31, 4)
ab_drop(b13, 4)
ab_drop(b31, 7)
ab_drop(b31, 10)
ab_drop(b11, 4)
ab_drop(b11, 7)
ab_drop(b11, 10)
```

This sequence of commands will stack the blocks in such a way that they form the shape of the letter "K" within the boundaries of the allowed space. The letter "K" will be formed by using the block types as described in the task.
