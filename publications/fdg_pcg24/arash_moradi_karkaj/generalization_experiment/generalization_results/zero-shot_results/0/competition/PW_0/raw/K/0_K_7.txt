To create the capital letter "K" in the Tetris-like environment, we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by dropping a horizontal straight block of width 3 (b31) at position 1.
2. Next, we drop a vertical straight block of height 3 (b13) at position 2.
3. Then, we drop another horizontal straight block of width 3 (b31) at position 4.
4. After that, we drop another vertical straight block of height 3 (b13) at position 5.
5. Finally, we place two 1x1 square blocks (b11) at positions 2 and 4 to complete the letter "K" shape.

Please note that the commands should be executed consecutively from top to bottom and should not exceed the boundaries of the environment.
