To generate the uppercase English letter "L", we need to consider the structure of the letter and the gravity rules.

The letter "L" consists of two block types: b31 and b13. We will use the ab_drop() command to place the blocks one by one and create the letter.

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "L":

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place the first block of type b31 at position 1
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Place the second block of type b31 at position 2
ab_drop("b31", 3)  # Place the third block of type b31 at position 3
ab_drop("b13", 3)  # Place the fourth block of type b13 at position 3
```

By executing these commands consecutively, the blocks will form the uppercase English letter "L" in the defined grid environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
