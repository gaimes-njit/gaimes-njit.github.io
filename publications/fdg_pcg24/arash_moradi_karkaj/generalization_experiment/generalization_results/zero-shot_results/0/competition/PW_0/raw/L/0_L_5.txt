To create the uppercase letter "L" within the given environment and using the provided block types, we need to strategically place the blocks using the ab_drop() command. 

Here is the stream of commands to generate the letter "L":

``` 
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place a horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Place a vertical block at position 4
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Place a vertical block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
ab_drop("b11", 1)  # Place a square block at position 1
```

These commands will create the letter "L" in the given environment, ensuring structural stability based on the gravity rules.
