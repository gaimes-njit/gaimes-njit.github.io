To create the uppercase letter "L" using the given block types and environment, the following set of ab_drop() commands can be used:

```
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b31',2)
ab_drop('b11',1)
```

Explanation:
- First, we place two vertical blocks ('b13') at position 1 on the width, which represents the vertical part of the "L" shape.
- Then, we place a horizontal block ('b31') at position 2 on the width, which represents the horizontal part of the "L" shape.
- Finally, we place a small square block ('b11') at position 1 on the width, adjacent to the vertical part of the "L" shape to complete the letter.

The resulting shape should resemble the uppercase letter "L" within the allowed space boundaries.
