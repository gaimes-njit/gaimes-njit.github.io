To create the uppercase letter "M" using the block types and gravity rules in the given environment, follow the below instructions:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Place the first vertical block at position 2
ab_drop("b11", 3)  # Place the center square block at position 3
ab_drop("b13", 4)  # Place the second vertical block at position 4
ab_drop("b31", 5)  # Place the second horizontal block at position 5
ab_drop("b11", 6)  # Place the third square block at position 6
ab_drop("b11", 7)  # Place the fourth square block at position 7
ab_drop("b31", 8)  # Place the third horizontal block at position 8
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place the third vertical block at position 9
ab_drop("b11", 10)  # Place the fifth square block at position 10
ab_drop("b11", 11)  # Place the sixth square block at position 11
ab_drop("b31", 12)  # Place the fourth horizontal block at position 12
ab_drop("b13", 13)  # Place the fourth vertical block at position 13
ab_drop("b11", 14)  # Place the seventh square block at position 14
ab_drop("b11", 15)  # Place the eighth square block at position 15
```

Note: The positioning of the blocks may vary based on the starting position and the exact dimensions of the blocks. Ensure the blocks are placed accurately to form a stable "M" shape.
