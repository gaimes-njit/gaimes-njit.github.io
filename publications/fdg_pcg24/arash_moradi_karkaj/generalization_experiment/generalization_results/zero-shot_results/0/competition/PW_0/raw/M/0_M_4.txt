To create the uppercase letter "M" using the block types and the given environment, we can proceed as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 11)
ab_drop("b31", 15)
```

Explanation:
1. The first three `ab_drop("b13", x)` commands will stack three vertical straight blocks of width 1 unit and height 3 units, starting from positions 1, 5, and 9. This forms the letter "M"'s two side vertical lines.

2. The next four `ab_drop("b31", x)` commands will stack four horizontal straight blocks of width 3 units and height 1 unit, starting from positions 3, 7, 11, and 15. This forms the letter "M"'s two middle horizontal lines.

By following these commands in order, the blocks will stack up and create the uppercase letter "M" within the given boundaries of the grid.
