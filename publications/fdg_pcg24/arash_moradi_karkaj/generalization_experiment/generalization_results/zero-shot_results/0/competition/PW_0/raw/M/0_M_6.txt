Here is the solution for generating uppercase letter "M":

```
ab_drop(b13,1);
ab_drop(b31,2);
ab_drop(b11,4);
ab_drop(b11,5);
ab_drop(b11,6);
ab_drop(b31,8);
ab_drop(b13,10);
```

Explanation:
1. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to form the left leg of the "M".
2. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2 to connect the left and middle legs of the "M".
3. Place a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 4 to start the middle leg of the "M".
4. Place two more 1x1 square blocks (b11) at positions 5 and 6 to extend the middle leg of the "M".
5. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 8 to connect the middle and right legs of the "M".
6. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 10 to form the right leg of the "M".

This sequence of commands will generate a stable and accurate representation of the letter "M" within the allowed space boundaries.
