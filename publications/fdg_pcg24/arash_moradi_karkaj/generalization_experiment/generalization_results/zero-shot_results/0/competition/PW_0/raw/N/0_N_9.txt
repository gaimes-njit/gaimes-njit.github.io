To create the uppercase English letter "N" using the block types and environment, we can break it down into three steps:

Step 1: Create the left vertical line of the "N" (b13 block)
Place the b13 block at position (1, 1)

Step 2: Create the diagonal line of the "N" (b11 and b31 blocks)
Place the b11 block at position (2, 3)
Place the b31 block at position (3, 2)

Step 3: Create the right vertical line of the "N" (b13 block)
Place the b13 block at position (4, 5)

Here are the commands to generate the uppercase English letter "N":

```
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b11, 2)
ab_drop(b31, 3)
ab_drop(b13, 4)
```

Please note that the commands need to be executed consecutively and only within the allowed space boundaries.
