To generate the uppercase letter "O" using the block types and environment provided, we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop(b31, 2)
ab_drop(b31, 3)
ab_drop(b13, 4)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b31, 5)
ab_drop(b31, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 5)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
```

This stream of commands will place the block types in the correct positions to form the letter "O", while ensuring stability and adherence to the gravity rules.
