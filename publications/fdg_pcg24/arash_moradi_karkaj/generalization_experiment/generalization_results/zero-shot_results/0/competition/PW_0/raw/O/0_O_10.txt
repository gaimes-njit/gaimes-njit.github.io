To create the uppercase English letter "O" using the block types and gravity rules, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b31 block at (5, 1) to create the top horizontal line of the "O".
2. Place a b13 block at (1, 4) to create the left vertical line of the "O".
3. Place a b11 block at (1, 5) to create the bottom left corner of the "O".
4. Place a b11 block at (4, 1) to create the top right corner of the "O".
5. Place a b11 block at (4, 5) to create the bottom right corner of the "O".
6. Place a b11 block at (5, 5) to create the bottom horizontal line of the "O".
7. Place a b13 block at (1, 8) to create the right vertical line of the "O".
8. Place a b13 block at (5, 8) to create the right vertical line of the "O".
