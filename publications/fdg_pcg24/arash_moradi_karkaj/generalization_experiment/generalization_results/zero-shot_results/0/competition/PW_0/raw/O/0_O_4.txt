To generate the uppercase English letter "O", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31',1)
ab_drop('b31',4)
ab_drop('b13',1)
ab_drop('b13',4)
```

Explanation of the commands:
- The first two commands `ab_drop('b31',1)` and `ab_drop('b31',4)` place horizontal straight blocks with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit at positions 1 and 4 along the width, respectively. This forms the top and bottom parts of the letter "O".
- The next two commands `ab_drop('b13',1)` and `ab_drop('b13',4)` place vertical straight blocks with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units at positions 1 and 4 along the width, respectively. This forms the left and right sides of the letter "O".

By executing these commands consecutively, the blocks will be stacked and will resemble the uppercase English letter "O" in the defined environment.
