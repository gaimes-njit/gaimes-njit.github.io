Here is the stream of commands to generate the capital letter "P":

```
ab_drop(b31,1)
ab_drop(b11,4)
ab_drop(b11,4)
ab_drop(b13,4)
ab_drop(b11,8)
ab_drop(b11,9)
ab_drop(b11,10)
ab_drop(b11,11)
ab_drop(b11,12)
ab_drop(b11,13)
ab_drop(b11,14)
ab_drop(b11,15)
ab_drop(b11,15)
```

Explanation:
- The first command places a horizontal straight block (b31) at position (1,1).
- The next three commands place one square block (b11) each at positions (4,4), (4,5), and (4,6), respectively. This creates the base of the letter "P".
- The fifth command places a vertical straight block (b13) at position (4,7), creating the vertical stroke of the letter "P".
- The next eight commands place one square block (b11) each at positions (8,8), (9,8), (10,8), (11,8), (12,8), (13,8), (14,8), and (15,8), respectively. This creates the top of the letter "P".
- The last two commands place two square blocks (b11) each at positions (15,9) and (15,10), respectively. This completes the top part of the letter "P".

Note: Make sure to input each command one by one, following the consecutive order specified above, to maintain the stability and accuracy of the letter "P".
