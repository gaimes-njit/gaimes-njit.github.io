2. Next, we drop two vertical straight blocks (b13) in position 1 to form the left side of the letter "Q".
3. Then, we drop a single 1x1 square block (b11) in positions 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 to form the outline of the letter "Q".
4. We drop a horizontal straight block (b31) in positions 1, 7, 10, and 13 to complete the bottom part of the letter "Q".
