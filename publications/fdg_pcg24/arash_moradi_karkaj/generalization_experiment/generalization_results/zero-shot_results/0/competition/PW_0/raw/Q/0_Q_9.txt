The task is to generate the uppercase English letter "Q" using the given block types and the defined environment. Here is the stream of ab_drop() commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 12)
ab_drop("b11", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 12)
ab_drop("b31", 15)
ab_drop("b11", 15)
ab_drop("b31", 15)
ab_drop("b11", 15)
ab_drop("b11", 15)
```

The above commands will place the blocks in a consecutive manner to form the letter "Q" in the defined environment while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
