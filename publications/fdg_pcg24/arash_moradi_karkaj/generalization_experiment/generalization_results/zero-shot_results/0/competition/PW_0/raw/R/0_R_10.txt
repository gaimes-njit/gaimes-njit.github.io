To create the uppercase letter "R", we can break it down into three parts - the vertical line, the diagonal line, and the horizontal line.

First, we will create the vertical line using the b13 block type. We will place it at positions (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4).

```
ab_drop(b13,1)
ab_drop(b13,1)
ab_drop(b13,1)
```

Next, we will create the diagonal line using the b11 block type. We will place it at positions (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), and (5,6).

```
ab_drop(b11,2)
ab_drop(b11,3)
ab_drop(b11,4)
ab_drop(b11,5)
```

Finally, we will create the horizontal line using the b31 block type. We will place it at positions (6,2), (6,3), and (6,4).

```
ab_drop(b31,6)
ab_drop(b31,6)
ab_drop(b31,6)
```

This will create the uppercase letter "R" within the allowed space boundaries.
