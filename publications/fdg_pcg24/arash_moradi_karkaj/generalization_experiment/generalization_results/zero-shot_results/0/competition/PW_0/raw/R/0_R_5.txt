To create the uppercase letter "R", we will need to use a combination of block types b11, b31, and b13. Here is the stream of commands that will generate the letter "R" in the specified environment:

```
ab_drop(b31, 1)  # Place a horizontal straight block at the first position along the width.
ab_drop(b31, 4)  # Place a horizontal straight block at the fourth position along the width.
ab_drop(b31, 7)  # Place a horizontal straight block at the seventh position along the width.
ab_drop(b13, 1)  # Place a vertical straight block at the first position along the width.
ab_drop(b11, 3)  # Place a square block at the third position along the width.
ab_drop(b11, 5)  # Place a square block at the fifth position along the width.
ab_drop(b11, 8)  # Place a square block at the eighth position along the width.
```

This sequence of commands will create the desired letter "R" shape within the grid while adhering to the gravity rules and avoiding any invalid shapes.
