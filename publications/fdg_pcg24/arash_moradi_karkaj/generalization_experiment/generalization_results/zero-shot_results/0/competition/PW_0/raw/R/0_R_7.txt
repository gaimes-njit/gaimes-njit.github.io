To generate the uppercase letter "R", we can divide it into three parts: the main vertical line, the horizontal line on top, and the diagonal line on the right.

Here is the stream of commands to create the letter "R":

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Place first vertical block
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Place second vertical block
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Place third vertical block
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Place horizontal block on top
ab_drop("b11", 4)  # Place small square block on the right
ab_drop("b31", 4)  # Place diagonal block on the right
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Place final vertical block
```

This sequence of commands will create the letter "R" with the blocks positioned correctly according to the gravity rules.
