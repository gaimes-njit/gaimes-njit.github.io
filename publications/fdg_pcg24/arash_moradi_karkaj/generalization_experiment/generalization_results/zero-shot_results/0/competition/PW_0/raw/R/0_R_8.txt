To create the uppercase letter "R" using the given block types and gravity rules, we will need to stack and position them correctly. Here are the commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)   # Placing the horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop("b31", 2)   # Placing the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop("b13", 2)   # Placing the vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop("b31", 3)   # Placing the horizontal straight block at position 3
ab_drop("b11", 3)   # Placing the square block at position 3
ab_drop("b13", 3)   # Placing the vertical straight block at position 3
ab_drop("b31", 4)   # Placing the horizontal straight block at position 4
ab_drop("b11", 4)   # Placing the square block at position 4
```

By following these commands and stacking the blocks in the prescribed manner, we will achieve the uppercase letter "R" in the Tetris-like environment.
