To create the uppercase letter "R" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a b11 block at position (1,5) using the ab_drop() command. This will serve as the vertical bar of the letter "R".

2. Place a b31 block at position (2,5) using the ab_drop() command. This will serve as the horizontal bar of the letter "R".

3. Place a b13 block at position (4,5) using the ab_drop() command. This will serve as the diagonal leg of the letter "R".

4. Place a b13 block at position (4,7) using the ab_drop() command. This will serve as the vertical leg of the letter "R".

5. Place a b31 block at position (5,5) using the ab_drop() command. This will serve as the horizontal bar of the letter "R".

Your final stream of commands would look like this:

```
ab_drop(b11, 1)
ab_drop(b31, 2)
ab_drop(b13, 4)
ab_drop(b13, 4)
ab_drop(b31, 5)
```
