To create the uppercase letter "S" using the provided block types, the following stream of ab_drop() commands should be used:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at the leftmost position (1-3).
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place a horizontal straight block next to the previous one.
ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Place a horizontal straight block next to the previous one.
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Place a square block next to the previous one.

ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place a vertical straight block below the top horizontal block.
ab_drop('b13', 8)   # Place a vertical straight block next to the previous one.
ab_drop('b13', 12)  # Place a vertical straight block next to the previous one.

ab_drop('b31', 1)   # Place a horizontal straight block at the leftmost position (1-3).
ab_drop('b31', 4)   # Place a horizontal straight block next to the previous one.
ab_drop('b31', 7)   # Place a horizontal straight block next to the previous one.
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Place a square block next to the previous one.

ab_drop('b13', 4)   # Place a vertical straight block below the top horizontal block.
ab_drop('b13', 8)   # Place a vertical straight block next to the previous one.
ab_drop('b13', 12)  # Place a vertical straight block next to the previous one.
```

This series of commands will create the uppercase letter "S" shape, ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules and within the allowed space boundaries.
