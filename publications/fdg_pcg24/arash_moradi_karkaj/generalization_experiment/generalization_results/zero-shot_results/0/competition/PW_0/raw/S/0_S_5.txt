To create the uppercase English letter "S" using the given block types and environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by placing a b11 block at (1, 2) to create the top-left corner of the "S". Use the command `ab_drop(b11, 2)`.

2. Place a b31 block horizontally at (2, 2) to create the top segment of the "S". Use the command `ab_drop(b31, 2)`.

3. Place a b31 block vertically at (1, 5) to create the middle segment of the "S". Use the command `ab_drop(b13, 5)`.

4. Place a b31 block horizontally at (2, 8) to create the bottom segment of the "S". Use the command `ab_drop(b31, 8)`.

5. Place a b11 block at (1, 11) to create the bottom-right corner of the "S". Use the command `ab_drop(b11, 11)`.

Your final stream of commands should look like this:

```
ab_drop(b11, 2)
ab_drop(b31, 2)
ab_drop(b13, 5)
ab_drop(b31, 8)
ab_drop(b11, 11)
```
