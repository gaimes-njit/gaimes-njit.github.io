To create the uppercase English letter "S" using the given block types and environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Place two b31 blocks horizontally at the top, with the first block starting at position 1 and the second block starting at position 4. This will create the top section of the "S".

```
ab_drop(b31, 1)
ab_drop(b31, 4)
```

2. Place a b13 block vertically below the second block of the top section, starting at position 4. This will create the middle section of the "S".

```
ab_drop(b13, 4)
```

3. Place another b31 block horizontally below the middle section, starting at position 1. This will create the bottom section of the "S".

```
ab_drop(b31, 1)
```

The final stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "S" would be:

```
ab_drop(b31, 1)
ab_drop(b31, 4)
ab_drop(b13, 4)
ab_drop(b31, 1)
```
