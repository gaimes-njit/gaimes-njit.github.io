To create the uppercase letter "T" using the given block types, we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)  # Drop a horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 2)  # Drop a vertical straight block at position 2
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Drop a horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop("b31", 3)  # Drop a horizontal straight block at position 3
```

This will create the letter "T" in the Tetris-like environment.
