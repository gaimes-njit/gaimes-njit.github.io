The stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "T" using the ab_drop() command and the given block types in the defined environment is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 1)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
```

This stream of commands will place the blocks in a way that forms the shape of the uppercase letter "T" and ensures structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
