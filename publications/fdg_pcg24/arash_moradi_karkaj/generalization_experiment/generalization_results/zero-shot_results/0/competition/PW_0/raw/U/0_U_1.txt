To create the uppercase English letter "U", we can use the following stream of commands:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 2)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
```

Explanation:
1. The first `ab_drop("b31", 1)` command places a horizontal straight block at position 1.
2. The second `ab_drop("b13", 1)` command places a vertical straight block below the previous block at position 1.
3. The third `ab_drop("b31", 4)` command places another horizontal straight block at position 4.
4. The fourth `ab_drop("b13", 4)` command places another vertical straight block below the previous block at position 4.
5. The next four `ab_drop("b11", x)` commands are used to create the horizontal line in the middle of the "U". They place four square blocks at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.

By following these commands, the uppercase letter "U" will be formed in the grid.
