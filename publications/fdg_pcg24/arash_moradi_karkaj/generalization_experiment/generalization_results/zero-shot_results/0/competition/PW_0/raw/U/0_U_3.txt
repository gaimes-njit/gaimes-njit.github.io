To create the uppercase letter "U" using the given block types in the defined environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Place a b31 block at position (1,1) using the command `ab_drop('b31', 1)`. This will form the top line of the letter "U".

2. Place two b13 blocks at positions (1,3) and (3,3) using the commands `ab_drop('b13', 1)` and `ab_drop('b13', 3)`. These two blocks will form the vertical sides of the letter "U".

3. Place a b31 block at position (1,5) using the command `ab_drop('b31', 1)`. This will form the bottom line of the letter "U".

The stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "U" is as follows:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
```
