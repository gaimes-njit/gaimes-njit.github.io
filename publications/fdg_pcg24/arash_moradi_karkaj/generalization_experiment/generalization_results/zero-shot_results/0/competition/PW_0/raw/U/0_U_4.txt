Explanation:
First, we drop a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1 to create the top of the letter "U".
Then, we drop a vertical straight block (b13) at position 1 to create the left side of the letter "U".
Next, we drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position 4 to create the middle part of the letter "U".
After that, we drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 5 to create the bottom of the letter "U".
We then drop another vertical straight block (b13) at position 5 to fill the gap in the middle part of the letter "U".
Finally, we drop another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 9 to complete the letter "U".
