To create the letter "U" using the given block types, we can break it down into three parts: the two vertical straight blocks on the sides, and the horizontal straight block at the bottom.

Here are the ab_drop() commands needed to achieve this:

First vertical straight block (left side):
```
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
ab_drop(b13, 1)
```

Horizontal straight block (bottom):
```
ab_drop(b31, 2)
ab_drop(b31, 3)
ab_drop(b31, 4)
```

Second vertical straight block (right side):
```
ab_drop(b13, 5)
ab_drop(b13, 5)
ab_drop(b13, 5)
```

This series of commands will create the letter "U" in the Tetris-like environment, with accurate representation and fit within the allowed space boundaries.
