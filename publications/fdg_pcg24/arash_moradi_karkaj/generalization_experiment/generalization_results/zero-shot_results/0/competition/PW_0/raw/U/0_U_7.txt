To generate the uppercase English letter "U" using the given block types, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place the first vertical straight block (b13) at position (1, 8) using the ab_drop() command. This will form the left side of the letter "U".

Step 2: Place the horizontal straight block (b31) at positions (2, 8), (3, 8), and (4, 8) using the ab_drop() command. This will form the top of the letter "U".

Step 3: Place the second vertical straight block (b13) at position (5, 8) using the ab_drop() command. This will form the right side of the letter "U".

The stream of commands would be as follows:

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 3)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
```

Note: The positions mentioned above are relative to the width of the grid.
