To generate the uppercase letter "U" using the provided block types and environment, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dropping a b31 block at position 1. This will form the top of the letter "U".
2. Drop another b31 block at position 4. This will form the bottom of the letter "U".
3. Drop a b13 block at position 2. This will form the left vertical line of the letter "U".
4. Drop a b13 block at position 4. This will form the right vertical line of the letter "U".

The stream of commands would look like this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
```

After executing these commands, you should have successfully generated the uppercase letter "U" within the allowed space boundaries.
