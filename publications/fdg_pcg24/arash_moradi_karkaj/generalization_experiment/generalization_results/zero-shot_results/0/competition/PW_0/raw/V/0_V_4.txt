To generate the letter "V", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Place the first vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Place the horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop("b31", 5)  # Place another horizontal straight block at position 5
ab_drop("b13", 6)  # Place the second vertical straight block at position 6
```

This sequence of commands will create an uppercase "V" shape in the defined environment, while ensuring structural stability with regard to the gravity rules.
