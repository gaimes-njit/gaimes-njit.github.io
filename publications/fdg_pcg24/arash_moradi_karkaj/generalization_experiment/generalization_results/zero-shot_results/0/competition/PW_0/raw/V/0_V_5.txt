To create the uppercase English letter "V" using the block types provided, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Place two b31 blocks horizontally to form the top part of the "V". Start from position (1, 5) and place the first block using the ab_drop() command:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
```

Place the second block using the same command, adjusting the X position to (4, 5):

```
ab_drop("b31", 4)
```

Step 2: Place a b13 block vertically to connect the two horizontal blocks. Start from position (3, 8) and use the ab_drop() command:

```
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

Step 3: Place a b13 block vertically to form the bottom part of the "V". Start from position (1, 11) and use the ab_drop() command:

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)
```

Step 4: Place a b13 block vertically to connect the two bottom blocks. Start from position (3, 14) and use the ab_drop() command:

```
ab_drop("b13", 3)
```

After following these steps and executing the commands consecutively, you will have successfully generated the uppercase English letter "V" within the allowed space boundaries while ensuring stability according to the gravity rules.
