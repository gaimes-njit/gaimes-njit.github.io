The stream of commands to create the uppercase letter "V" using the given block types in the defined environment is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 5)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
```

Explanation: 
1. The first command `ab_drop("b31", 1)` places a horizontal straight block of width 3 units and height 1 unit at the position 1.
2. The second command `ab_drop("b13", 2)` places a vertical straight block of width 1 unit and height 3 units at the position 2.
3. The third command `ab_drop("b31", 4)` places another horizontal straight block of width 3 units and height 1 unit at the position 4.
4. The fourth and subsequent commands `ab_drop("b11", 5)`, `ab_drop("b11", 6)`, and `ab_drop("b11", 7)` place three 1x1 square blocks in a vertical arrangement at positions 5, 6, and 7, respectively. This completes the formation of the uppercase letter "V".
