To generate the uppercase letter "V", we can use the following blocks:

1. Place a b31 block at position (1, 1) to create the top of the "V".
2. Place a b13 block at position (4, 1) to create the left side of the "V".
3. Place a b13 block at position (7, 1) to create the right side of the "V".

Here are the commands to achieve this:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```
