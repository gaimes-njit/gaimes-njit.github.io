The stream of commands to generate the uppercase letter "V" would be:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b11', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 4)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 6)
```

Explanation:
1. Place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 1.
2. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 2.
3. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 3.
4. Place a small square block (b11) on top of the previous vertical block (position 3).
5. Place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 4.
6. Place a vertical straight block (b13) at position 5.
7. Place another vertical straight block (b13) at position 6.

These commands will result in the formation of the letter "V" using the defined block types and within the specified boundaries of the environment.
