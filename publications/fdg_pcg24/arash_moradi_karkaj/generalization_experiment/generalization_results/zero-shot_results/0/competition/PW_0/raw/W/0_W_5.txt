To create the uppercase letter "W" using the given block types and following the defined environment and rules, the ab_drop() commands can be used as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 1)   # Place a horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 4)   # Place a vertical block at position 4
ab_drop("b31", 7)   # Place a horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Place a vertical block at position 10
ab_drop("b31", 13)  # Place a horizontal block at position 13
ab_drop("b13", 16)  # Place a vertical block at position 16
```

By executing these commands sequentially, the letter "W" will be created within the allowed space boundaries and following the 2D gravity rules.
