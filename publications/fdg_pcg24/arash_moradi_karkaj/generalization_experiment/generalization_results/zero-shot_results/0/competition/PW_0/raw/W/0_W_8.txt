The task prompt requires us to create the uppercase English letter "W" using the provided block types and following the rules of the environment. 

To create the letter "W", we can break it down into three parts: the left slant, the middle straight line, and the right slant. 

Here is the stream of commands to create the letter "W":

```
ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 5)
ab_drop('b31', 5)
ab_drop('b13', 8)
ab_drop('b31', 9)
ab_drop('b13', 12)
ab_drop('b31', 12)
ab_drop('b13', 15)
```

Explanation of the commands:
1. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 1.
2. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 2.
3. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 5.
4. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 5.
5. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 8.
6. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 9.
7. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 12.
8. Place a horizontal straight block ('b31') at position 12.
9. Place a vertical straight block ('b13') at position 15.

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase English letter "W" within the defined environment while maintaining stacking and stability.
