```
ab_drop("b31", 1)   # Place the first horizontal block at position 1
ab_drop("b13", 4)   # Place the vertical block at position 4
ab_drop("b31", 7)   # Place the second horizontal block at position 7
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Place the vertical block at position 10
ab_drop("b31", 13)  # Place the third horizontal block at position 13
ab_drop("b13", 16)  # Place the vertical block at position 16
```
Note: The above commands assume that the blocks will automatically fall down due to gravity. You may need to adjust the positions slightly depending on the implementation of the gravity rules in your environment.
