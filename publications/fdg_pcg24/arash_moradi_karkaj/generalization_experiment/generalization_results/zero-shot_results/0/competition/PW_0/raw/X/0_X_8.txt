To create the letter "X" using the given block types and gravity rules, the following stream of commands can be used:

```
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 2)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 2)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

Explanation:
1. The first three commands `ab_drop("b31", 2)`, `ab_drop("b31", 5)`, and `ab_drop("b31", 8)` are used to create the horizontal bars of the letter "X". The block type "b31" is used to create these bars with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit.
2. The next three commands `ab_drop("b13", 2)`, `ab_drop("b13", 5)`, and `ab_drop("b13", 8)` are used to create the vertical bars of the letter "X". The block type "b13" is used to create these bars with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units.
3. Finally, the last three commands `ab_drop("b31", 2)`, `ab_drop("b31", 5)`, and `ab_drop("b31", 8)` are repeated to reinforce the horizontal bars and complete the letter "X".

By following these commands, the letter "X" will be generated in the defined environment while maintaining stacking and stability with the gravity rules.
