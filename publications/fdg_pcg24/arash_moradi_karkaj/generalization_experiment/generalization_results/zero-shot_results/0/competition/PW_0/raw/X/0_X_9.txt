To generate the uppercase letter "X" using the given block types, we need to carefully place the blocks in a specific pattern to ensure the stability of the structure. Here are the steps to construct the letter "X":

1. Start by placing a b13 block at position (3, 1) using the ab_drop(3, 1) command.

```
ab_drop(1, 3)
```

2. Place another b13 block at position (3, 4) using the ab_drop(3, 4) command.

```
ab_drop(3, 4)
```

3. Place a b13 block at position (3, 7) using the ab_drop(3, 7) command.

```
ab_drop(3, 7)
```

4. Place a b13 block at position (3, 10) using the ab_drop(3, 10) command.

```
ab_drop(3, 10)
```

5. Place a b13 block at position (3, 13) using the ab_drop(3, 13) command.

```
ab_drop(3, 13)
```

6. Place a b31 block at position (6, 4) using the ab_drop(6, 4) command.

```
ab_drop(6, 4)
```

7. Place a b31 block at position (9, 1) using the ab_drop(9, 1) command.

```
ab_drop(9, 1)
```

8. Place a b31 block at position (12, 4) using the ab_drop(12, 4) command.

```
ab_drop(12, 4)
```

9. Place a b31 block at position (9, 7) using the ab_drop(9, 7) command.

```
ab_drop(9, 7)
```

10. Place a b31 block at position (6, 10) using the ab_drop(6, 10) command.

```
ab_drop(6, 10)
```

11. Place a b31 block at position (9, 13) using the ab_drop(9, 13) command.

```
ab_drop(9, 13)
```

12. Place a b11 block at position (15, 7) using the ab_drop(15, 7) command.

```
ab_drop(15, 7)
```

By following these steps, you will generate the uppercase letter "X" using the given block types.
