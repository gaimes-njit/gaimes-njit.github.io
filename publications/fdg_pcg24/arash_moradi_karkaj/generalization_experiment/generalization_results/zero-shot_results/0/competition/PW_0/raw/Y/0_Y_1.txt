To create the uppercase letter "Y" using the given block types and gravity rules, we can follow the following steps:

Step 1:
Place the b13 block at position (1,10) using the ab_drop(3,1) command to create the vertical stem of the "Y".

Step 2:
Place the b31 block at positions (3,8), (4,8), and (5,8) using the ab_drop(2,3), ab_drop(2,4), and ab_drop(2,5) commands respectively, to create the horizontal arm of the "Y".

Step 3:
Place the b11 block at position (4,10) using the ab_drop(1,4) command to create the connecting point between the stem and arm of the "Y".

The complete set of commands to create the uppercase letter "Y" is as follows:

```
ab_drop(3,1)
ab_drop(2,3)
ab_drop(2,4)
ab_drop(2,5)
ab_drop(1,4)
```

Execute these commands consecutively to create the desired shape.
