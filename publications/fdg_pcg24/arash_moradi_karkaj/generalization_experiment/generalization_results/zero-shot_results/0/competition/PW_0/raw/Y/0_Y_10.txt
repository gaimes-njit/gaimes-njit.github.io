To create the uppercase letter "Y", we can use the following set of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b31', 2)
ab_drop('b11', 2)
ab_drop('b31', 3)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
```

Explanation:
1. The first two commands `ab_drop('b31', 1)` and `ab_drop('b31', 2)` create the two horizontal bars at the top of the letter "Y".
2. The third command `ab_drop('b11', 2)` adds a single block to connect the two bars together vertically.
3. The fourth command `ab_drop('b31', 3)` creates the vertical bar of the letter "Y".
4. The fifth command `ab_drop('b13', 2)` adds a single block below the connecting block to complete the letter "Y".

Remember to include the command stream consecutively between the three backticks (```) when submitting your solution.
