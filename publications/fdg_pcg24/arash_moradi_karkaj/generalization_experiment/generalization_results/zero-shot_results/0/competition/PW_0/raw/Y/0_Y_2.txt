To create the uppercase letter "Y", we can start by placing a block of type b13 vertically at position (3,1) to form the left vertical part of the letter:

```
ab_drop(b13,3)
```

Next, we can place a block of type b31 horizontally at position (4,1) to form the top horizontal part of the letter:

```
ab_drop(b31,4)
```

Finally, we can place another block of type b13 vertically at position (4,4) to form the right vertical part of the letter:

```
ab_drop(b13,4)
```

Here is the complete stream of commands:

```
ab_drop(b13,3)
ab_drop(b31,4)
ab_drop(b13,4)
```
