To generate the uppercase English letter "Y" using the given block types and environment, we can use the following ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop('b11', 4)  # Place square block at position 4
ab_drop('b13', 4)  # Place vertical straight block at position 4
ab_drop('b11', 5)  # Place square block at position 5
ab_drop('b11', 6)  # Place square block at position 6
ab_drop('b11', 8)  # Place square block at position 8
```

These commands will construct the uppercase letter "Y" within the allowed space boundaries and adhere to the 2D gravity rules.
