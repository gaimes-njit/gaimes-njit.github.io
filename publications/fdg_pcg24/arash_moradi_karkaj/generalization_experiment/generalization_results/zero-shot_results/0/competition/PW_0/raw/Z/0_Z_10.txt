To create the uppercase letter "Z", we can use the following stream of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop("b13", 1)  # Place vertical straight block at position 1
ab_drop("b31", 2)  # Place horizontal straight block at position 2
ab_drop("b13", 5)  # Place vertical straight block at position 5
ab_drop("b11", 5)  # Place square block at position 5
```

This sequence of commands will create the uppercase letter "Z" within the allowed space boundaries and following the 2D gravity rules.
