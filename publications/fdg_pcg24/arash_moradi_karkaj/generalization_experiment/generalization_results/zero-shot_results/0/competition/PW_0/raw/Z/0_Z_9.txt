To create the uppercase letter "Z", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() commands:

```
ab_drop(b11, 1)
ab_drop(b31, 2)
ab_drop(b31, 5)
ab_drop(b13, 4)
ab_drop(b11, 5)
```

Explanation:
1. We start by placing a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 1.
2. Next, we place a horizontal straight block (b31) at position 2, making the first segment of the letter "Z".
3. Then, we place another horizontal straight block (b31) at position 5, completing the second segment of the letter "Z".
4. We continue by placing a vertical straight block (b13) at position 4, connecting the two horizontal segments.
5. Finally, we add a 1x1 square block (b11) at position 5 to complete the letter "Z".

Note: This sequence of commands is just one of many possible solutions to create the letter "Z" using the given block types and environment.
