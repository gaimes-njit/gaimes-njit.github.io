To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "D" while meeting all the hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet.

2. Start by dropping a b31 block centered at slot 6 using the ab_drop() function. This will serve as the base of the structure.

3. Drop two b11 blocks to the left and right of the base block, centered at slots 4 and 8, respectively. These blocks will act as supports for the upper part of the structure.

4. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 6, but at layer 6. This block will form the diagonal part of the character "D".

5. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 5, but at layer 9. This block will form the vertical part of the character "D".

6. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 7, but at layer 9. This block will complete the diagonal part of the character "D".

7. Drop a b11 block centered at slot 6, but at layer 12. This block will form the top part of the character "D".

8. Drop a b11 block centered at slot 6, but at layer 13. This block will form the top part of the character "D".

9. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 6, but at layer 14. This block will form the final vertical part of the character "D".

10. The structure should now resemble the character "D". You can print the structure to see the final result.

Note: Make sure to update the structure variable after each block drop to keep track of the current state of the structure.
