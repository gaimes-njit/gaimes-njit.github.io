To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "G" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Initialize the structure grid.
```python
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the base of the character "G" to create a stable foundation.
```python
ab_drop('b11', 9)
```

Step 3: Drop the vertical block on the left side of the character "G".
```python
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```

Step 4: Drop the horizontal block on top of the vertical block.
```python
ab_drop('b31', 7)
```

Step 5: Drop the horizontal block on the right side of the character "G".
```python
ab_drop('b31', 12)
```

Step 6: Drop the vertical block on top of the horizontal blocks.
```python
ab_drop('b13', 9)
```

After following these steps, the structure grid will resemble the character "G" while satisfying all hard constraints. Note that the exact positions of the blocks and the order of dropping may slightly vary depending on the initial state of the structure grid.
