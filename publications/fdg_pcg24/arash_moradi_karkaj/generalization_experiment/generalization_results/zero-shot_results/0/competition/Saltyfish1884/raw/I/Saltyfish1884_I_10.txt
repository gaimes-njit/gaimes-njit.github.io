To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Import the required libraries and initialize the structure grid:

```python
W = 20  # Width of the map
H = 16  # Height of the map

structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]  # Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
```

Step 2: Define a function to determine the stability of the structure after placing a block:

```python
def is_stable(drop_pos):
    # Check if the block is placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks)
    if drop_pos[0] < H-1 and (structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] == 'b11' or structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] == 'b13'):
        return True
    return False
```

Step 3: Place the b31 block on the base to prevent overhangs:

```python
ab_drop('b31', W//2)  # Drop a b31 block at the center slot
```

Step 4: Drop the b13 blocks below the b31 block:

```python
for i in range(W//2 - 1, W//2 + 2):  # Drop 3 b13 blocks horizontally below the b31 block
    ab_drop('b13', i)
```

Step 5: Place the remaining b11 blocks to complete the structure:

```python
for i in range(W//2 - 1, W//2 + 2):  # Place 3 b11 blocks horizontally above the b31 block
    structure[H-4][i] = 'b11'
```

Step 6: Print the final structure:

```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

This will generate a stable structure that resembles the character "I" while meeting all hard constraints.
