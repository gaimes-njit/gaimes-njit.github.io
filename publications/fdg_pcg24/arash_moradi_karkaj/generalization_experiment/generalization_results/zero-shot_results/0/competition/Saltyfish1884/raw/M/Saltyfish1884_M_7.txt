To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "M" while meeting all the hard constraints, we need to carefully consider the stability rules and constraints mentioned. 

Step 1: Set up the initial structure

Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid:
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

Step 2: Determine the dropping position and order

To meet the stability rules, we need to first drop the b31 blocks on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs. Following this, we can place the remaining blocks to complete the structure.

Step 3: Determine the shape of the structure

To resemble the character "M," we can consider the following shape for the structure:

1. Place a b31 block near the bottom of the structure to act as the base.
2. Drop two b31 blocks on top of the base block, slightly offset to form the diagonal legs of the "M."
3. Drop a b31 block on top of the center of the base block to form the middle vertical line of the "M."
4. Drop two b11 blocks on top of the diagonal legs of the "M" to form the upper part of the structure.
5. Finally, drop a b11 block on top of the middle vertical line to complete the structure resembling the character "M."

Step 4: Use the ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks

Using the ab_drop() function, we can put suitable blocks in the determined dropping position and order to form the structure that resembles the character "M."

# Drop the blocks to form the structure resembling the character "M"
ab_drop('b31', 9)   # Base block
ab_drop('b31', 8)   # Diagonal leg 1
ab_drop('b31', 12)  # Diagonal leg 2
ab_drop('b31', 10)  # Middle vertical line
ab_drop('b11', 8)   # Upper part block 1
ab_drop('b11', 12)  # Upper part block 2
ab_drop('b11', 10)  # Middle part block

Step 5: Verify the structure

After dropping the blocks according to the desired shape and order, verify if the resulting structure meets all the hard constraints, including stability and no boundary intrusion.

The final result will be a structure that resembles the character "M" in accordance with the given requirements and constraints.
