To generate a structure that resembles the character "N" while meeting all hard constraints, we can follow these steps using the ab_drop() function:

Step 1: Create an empty structure grid using the code provided:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]
```

Step 2: Drop the b31 block to form the base:
```python
ab_drop('b31', 9)
```
This will drop the b31 block with its center aligned at slot 9, creating a stable base at the bottom of the structure.

Step 3: Drop the b13 block on top of the b31 block to form the left vertical part of the "N":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 7)
```
This will drop the b13 block with its center aligned at slot 7, forming the left vertical part of the "N" on top of the base.

Step 4: Drop the b13 block next to the left vertical part to form the middle diagonal part of the "N":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 10)
```
This will drop the b13 block with its center aligned at slot 10, forming the middle diagonal part of the "N" adjacent to the left vertical part.

Step 5: Drop the b13 block on top of the middle diagonal part to form the right vertical part of the "N":
```python
ab_drop('b13', 13)
```
This will drop the b13 block with its center aligned at slot 13, forming the right vertical part of the "N" on top of the middle diagonal part.

Step 6: The structure should now resemble the character "N". Print the structure to verify:
```python
for row in structure:
    print(' '.join(row))
```

The result should be a stable structure that resembles the character "N" and meets all the hard constraints.
