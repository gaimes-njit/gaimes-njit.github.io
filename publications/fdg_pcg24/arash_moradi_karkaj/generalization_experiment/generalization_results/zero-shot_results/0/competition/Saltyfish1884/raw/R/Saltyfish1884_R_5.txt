To generate a stable structure resembling the character "R" using the ab_drop() function and meet all the constraints, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid using the provided code snippet.

2. Start by dropping a b13 block at slot 10 (aligned with the 'R' shape) using the ab_drop(b13, 10) function. This will serve as the vertical part of the "R".

3. Next, drop a b31 block at slot 9 aligned with the bottom of the previously dropped b13 block using the ab_drop(b31, 9) function. This will be the horizontal part of the "R".

4. Drop a b31 block at slot 11 aligned with the bottom of the previously dropped b13 block using the ab_drop(b31, 11) function. This will be the other horizontal part of the "R".

5. Drop a b31 block at slot 12 aligned with the top of the previously dropped b13 block using the ab_drop(b31, 12) function. This will complete the horizontal part of the "R".

6. Finally, drop a b11 block at slot 9 aligned with the bottom of the previously dropped b31 blocks using the ab_drop(b11, 9) function. This will fill in the empty space in the middle of the "R".

By following these steps, you should be able to use the ab_drop() function to generate a stable structure resembling the character "R" while meeting all the hard constraints.
