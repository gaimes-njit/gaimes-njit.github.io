To generate a stable structure that resembles the character "X", we can break it down into multiple steps as follows:

Step 1: Fill the base layer with a b11 block to create a solid foundation.
ab_drop('b11', 9)  # Drop a b11 block at slot 9 of the base layer

Step 2: Drop two b31 blocks diagonally on top of the base block to form the diagonal lines of the "X".
ab_drop('b31', 7)  # Drop a b31 block at slot 7
ab_drop('b31', 11)  # Drop a b31 block at slot 11

Step 3: Drop two b13 blocks vertically to complete the "X".
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop a b13 block at slot 9
ab_drop('b13', 9)  # Drop another b13 block at slot 9

The resulting structure will resemble the character "X" and meet all the given hard constraints of stability and no boundary intrusion.
