To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital letter "E", we will need to carefully place each block in a bottom-to-top fashion while ensuring stability.

Step 1: Create the base of the letter "E"
We will start by creating the base of the letter "E" using a row block "b31". We will center it at x_position=9 to ensure stability.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 2: Create the top horizontal bar of the letter "E"
Next, we will create the top horizontal bar of the letter "E" using a row block "b31". We will center it at x_position=9 as well.

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```

Step 3: Create the middle vertical bar of the letter "E"
Lastly, we will create the middle vertical bar of the letter "E" using a column block "b13". We will place it at x_position=11 to connect the base and top horizontal bar.

```
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```

The complete implementation to generate an "E" in the level is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 11)
```
