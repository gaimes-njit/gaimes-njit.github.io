To generate a structure in the level that looks like the capital character "F", we can follow the hints provided and build the structure using the ab_drop() function.

1. Place the base of the "F" horizontally using the "b31" block type. We will place it at the center of the grid (x_position = 10).

ab_drop("b31", 10)

2. Place the vertical bar of the "F" using the "b13" block type. We will place it one row below the base, also at the center of the grid.

ab_drop("b13", 10)

3. Finally, place the top horizontal bar of the "F" using the "b31" block type. We will place it two rows above the base, centered.

ab_drop("b31", 10)

The complete implementation is as follows:

```python
ab_drop("b31", 10)
ab_drop("b13", 10)
ab_drop("b31", 10)
```
