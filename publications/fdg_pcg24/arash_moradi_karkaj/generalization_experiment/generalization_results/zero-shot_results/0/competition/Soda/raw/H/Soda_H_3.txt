To generate the letter "H" in the level, we can break it down into three blocks - two vertical bars and one horizontal bar. We will place the blocks in a bottom-to-top fashion to ensure stability. Here is the code to achieve this:

```
# Drop the first vertical bar at the leftmost position
ab_drop("b31", 1)

# Drop the horizontal bar at the center position
ab_drop("b13", 9)

# Drop the second vertical bar at the rightmost position
ab_drop("b31", 17)
```

This code will generate an "H" shape in the level, with the two vertical bars on the sides and the horizontal bar in the middle.

Please note that the exact positions and orientations of the blocks may vary depending on the implementation of the `ab_drop()` function and the actual gameplay. The above code assumes a top-down orientation and uses specific cell indexes that may need to be adjusted in the actual implementation.
