To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital "S", we can use the following sequence of ab_drop() calls:

1. First, we need to create the bottom curve of the "S" shape. We can use a row block ("b31") centered at position x=1. This will create cells (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0).
ab_drop("b31", 1)

2. Next, we need to create the middle part of the "S" shape. We can use a column block ("b13") centered at position x=4. This will create cells (3,1), (4,1), and (5,1).
ab_drop("b13", 4)

3. Finally, we need to create the top curve of the "S" shape. We can use a row block ("b31") centered at position x=8. This will create cells (7,2), (8,2), and (9,2).
ab_drop("b31", 8)

This sequence of ab_drop() calls will generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital "S" and is stable.
