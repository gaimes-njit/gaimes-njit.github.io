To generate a structure that looks like the capital letter "S" in the level, we can start by building the base of the letter first and then adding the rest of the blocks accordingly.

Here is the complete implementation to achieve the desired structure:

ab_drop("b31", 7)  # Place the base row block
ab_drop("b13", 6)  # Place the top left column block
ab_drop("b13", 9)  # Place the top right column block
ab_drop("b13", 10)  # Place the middle left column block
ab_drop("b31", 11)  # Place the middle row block
ab_drop("b13", 12)  # Place the middle right column block
ab_drop("b31", 15)  # Place the top row block

By following the above implementation, we can build a structure that resembles the capital letter "S" in the level, satisfying the stability and similarity requirements.
