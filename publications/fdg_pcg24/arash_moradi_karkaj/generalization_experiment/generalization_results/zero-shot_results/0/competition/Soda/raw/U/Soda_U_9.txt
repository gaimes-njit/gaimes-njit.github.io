To generate a structure that looks like the capital character "U", we can follow the bottom-to-top approach and build the structure layer by layer. 

1. First, we need to build the base of the "U". We can start by dropping a row block "b31" at the center of the grid (x_position = 9) to form the bottom bar of the "U". 

ab_drop("b31", 9)

2. Next, we will build the two vertical bars of the "U". We can drop two column blocks "b13" at the positions (x_position = 5) and (x_position = 13) to form the vertical bars.

ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 13)

3. Finally, we will build the horizontal bar of the "U". We can drop a row block "b31" at the top of the vertical bars (x_position = 9) to complete the structure.

ab_drop("b31", 9)

The complete implementation would look like this:

```
ab_drop("b31", 9)
ab_drop("b13", 5)
ab_drop("b13", 13)
ab_drop("b31", 9)
```
