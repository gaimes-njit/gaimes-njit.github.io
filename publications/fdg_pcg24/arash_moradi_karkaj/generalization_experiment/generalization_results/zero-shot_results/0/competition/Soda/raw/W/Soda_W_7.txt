To generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital character "W" (TARGET), we can break it down into smaller components and assemble them accordingly. Following the hints provided, we will create the components and then assemble them to form the "W" shape.

Step 1: Create the base blocks
Since the bottom blocks should be placed first, we need to create the bottom blocks of the "W" shape. We can use block type "b31" to create a row block.

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

The above code will create two row blocks at horizontal indices 7 and 8.

Step 2: Assemble the middle blocks
Next, we need to create the middle blocks of the "W" shape. We can use block type "b13" to create a column block and place it on the two bottom blocks.

```
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
```

The above code will create two column blocks on top of the bottom row blocks at horizontal indices 7 and 8.

Step 3: Create the top block
Finally, we need to create the top block of the "W" shape. We can use block type "b31" to create a row block and place it on top of the middle blocks.

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```

The above code will create two row blocks on top of the middle column blocks at horizontal indices 7 and 8.

The complete implementation to generate a structure in the level that looks like a capital character "W" is as follows:

```
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b13", 8)
ab_drop("b31", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 8)
```
