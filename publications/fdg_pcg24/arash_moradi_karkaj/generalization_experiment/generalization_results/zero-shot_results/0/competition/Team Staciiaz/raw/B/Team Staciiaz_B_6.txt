To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "B" and meets all the constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop the blocks and satisfy the stability constraint. 

Here is the approach to create the structure:

1. Start by initializing the structure as an empty grid using the given code:
```python
W = 20
H = 16
structure = [[' '] * W for _ in range(H)]
```

2. Drop the first block at the bottom layer (layer 0) using the `ab_drop()` function. For the character "B", we can use the block type `b13` to represent the vertical line of the "B". The `x_position` will be the desired slot number where the block center is aligned (e.g., 5). This will drop the block and update the structure accordingly.

```python
ab_drop('b13', 5)
```

3. Drop the second block to form the top curved part of the "B". For the character "B", we can use the block type `b31` to represent the curved part. The `x_position` will be the desired slot number (e.g., 5) to align the center of the block. This will drop the block and update the structure.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 5)
```

4. Drop the third block to complete the bottom curved part of the "B". Again, we can use the block type `b31` to represent the curved part. The `x_position` will be the desired slot number (e.g., 8) to align the center of the block. This will drop the block and update the structure.

```python
ab_drop('b31', 8)
```

5. The resulting structure will look like the character "B" and will satisfy the stability constraint. Additionally, it will not intrude on the boundary of the map, meeting the boundary intrusion constraint.

You can further modify the slot numbers and block types based on your requirements to adjust the position and shape of the character "B" within the given constraints.
