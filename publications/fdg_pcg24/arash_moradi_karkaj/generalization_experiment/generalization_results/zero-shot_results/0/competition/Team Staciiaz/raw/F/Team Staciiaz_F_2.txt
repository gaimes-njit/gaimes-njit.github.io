To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and meets all the given constraints, we can use the `ab_drop()` function to strategically drop the blocks.

First, let's analyze the structure of the character "F" and identify the positions at which each block should be dropped.

The character "F" can be divided into three parts: the vertical line, the horizontal line, and the middle bar. We can represent these parts using the block types as follows:

Vertical line: b13 (vertical block)
Horizontal line: b31 (horizontal block)
Middle bar: b11 (square block)

Based on this analysis, we can start dropping the blocks in the following order:

1. Drop a b13 block at slot 1 to represent the vertical line.
2. Drop a b31 block at slot 1 to represent the top part of the horizontal line.
3. Drop a b31 block at slot 1 to represent the middle part of the horizontal line.
4. Drop a b31 block at slot 2 to represent the bottom part of the horizontal line.
5. Drop a b11 block at slot 2 to represent the middle bar.

To translate this into code using the `ab_drop()` function, we can do the following:

```python
ab_drop('b13', 1)  # Drop a vertical block at slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop the top part of the horizontal line at slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 1)  # Drop the middle part of the horizontal line at slot 1
ab_drop('b31', 2)  # Drop the bottom part of the horizontal line at slot 2
ab_drop('b11', 2)  # Drop the middle bar at slot 2
```

Running this code will generate a stable structure that looks like the character "F" and meets all the given constraints.

Note: The exact slot positions and block types may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your scenario. The example provided above is a general approach to generate a stable structure resembling the character "F".
