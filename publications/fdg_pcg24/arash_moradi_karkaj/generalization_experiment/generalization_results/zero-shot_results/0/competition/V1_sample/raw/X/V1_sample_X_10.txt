To create a stable structure that looks like an "X" using the 'ab drop()' function, we would need to drop blocks in a specific order and position to achieve the desired shape. Here is a possible sequence of dropping blocks:

1. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 10 from layer 15.
2. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 11 from layer 14.
3. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 12 from layer 13.
4. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 9 from layer 12.
5. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 8 from layer 11.
6. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 7 from layer 10.
7. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 13 from layer 9.
8. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 14 from layer 8.
9. Drop a b13 block centered at slot 15 from layer 7.
10. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 10 from layer 6.
11. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 10 from layer 5.
12. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 10 from layer 4.
13. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 10 from layer 3.
14. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 10 from layer 2.
15. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 10 from layer 1.
16. Drop a b31 block centered at slot 10 from layer 0.

By following this sequence and positioning the blocks correctly, you should be able to achieve a stable structure that looks like an "X". Adjust the slot positions and block types as needed to refine the shape of the structure.
