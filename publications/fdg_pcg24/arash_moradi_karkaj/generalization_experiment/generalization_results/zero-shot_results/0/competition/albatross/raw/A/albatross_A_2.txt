To construct a level for Science Birds that resembles the letter "A", we can use the `ab_drop()` function to drop blocks in a sequential manner. The following code sequence satisfies all the constraints:

ab_drop('b31', 10)
ab_drop('b13', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 10)
ab_drop('b11', 9)
ab_drop('b11', 11)

Explanation:
- The first block being dropped is a B31 block at slot 10. This forms the base of the "A" shape.
- The second block being dropped is a B13 block at slot 10. This forms the left side of the "A" shape.
- The third block being dropped is a B11 block at slot 10. This forms the top of the "A" shape.
- The fourth block being dropped is a B11 block at slot 9. This forms the top left part of the "A" shape.
- The fifth block being dropped is a B11 block at slot 11. This forms the top right part of the "A" shape.

The resulting structure will resemble the letter "A" and maintain stability under gravity, satisfying all the constraints of the Science Birds game.
