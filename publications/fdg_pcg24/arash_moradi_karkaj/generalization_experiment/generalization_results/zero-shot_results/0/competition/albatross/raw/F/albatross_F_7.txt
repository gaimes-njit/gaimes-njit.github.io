The code sequence to construct an "F" level in Science Birds that follows all the constraints and maintains stability under gravity is as follows:

ab_drop('b13', 1)
ab_drop('b13', 2)
ab_drop('b13', 3)
ab_drop('b31', 1)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 4)
ab_drop('b11', 0)
ab_drop('b11', 4)

This code sequence drops the blocks in the following order:
1. Drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 1.
2. Drop another vertical block ('b13') at slot 2.
3. Drop a vertical block ('b13') at slot 3.
4. Drop a horizontal block ('b31') at slot 1, occupying slots 0, 1, and 2.
5. Drop a square block ('b11') at slot 0.
6. Drop a square block ('b11') at slot 4.
7. Drop another square block ('b11') at slot 0.
8. Drop another square block ('b11') at slot 4.

This sequence creates a structure that resembles the letter "F" within the given constraints and maintains stability under gravity.
