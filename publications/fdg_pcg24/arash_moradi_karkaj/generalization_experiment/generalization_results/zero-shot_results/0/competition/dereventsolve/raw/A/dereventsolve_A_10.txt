To generate a structure that looks like the letter "A" using the given database, we need to find the appropriate key-value pairs. 

Here is the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to create the letter "A":

```
ab_drop("head")

ab_drop("shoulder")
ab_drop("shoulder")

ab_drop("waist")
ab_drop("waist")
ab_drop("waist")

ab_drop("knee")
ab_drop("knee")
ab_drop("knee")
```

Using these `ab_drop` function calls will create a structure that resembles the letter "A" when viewed from top to bottom.
