To generate a structure that looks like the letter "A", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
database["top_left"] = "a"
database["top_right"] = "o"
database["bottom_left"] = "o"
database["bottom_right"] = "a"
database["middle"] = "i"

sequence = []
sequence.append(ab_drop(database["top_left"]))
sequence.append(ab_drop(database["top_right"]))
sequence.append(ab_drop(database["bottom_left"]))
sequence.append(ab_drop(database["bottom_right"]))
sequence.append(ab_drop(database["middle"]))

return sequence
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will generate the structure that looks like the letter "A" by dropping the specified letters from the database.
