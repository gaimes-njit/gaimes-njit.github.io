I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I understand the task. Could you please explain what you mean by "structure that looks like the letter 'A'"? Are you looking for a way to represent the letter "A" using the key-value pairs in the database? Could you also provide an example of the format of the key-value pairs in the database? This will help me provide a more accurate response.
