To generate a structure that looks like the letter "A", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop(a, 1)
ab_drop(a, 3)
ab_drop(a, 5)
ab_drop(b, 2)
ab_drop(b, 4)
```

This sequence of function calls will create a structure resembling the letter "A" using the `ab_drop` function.
