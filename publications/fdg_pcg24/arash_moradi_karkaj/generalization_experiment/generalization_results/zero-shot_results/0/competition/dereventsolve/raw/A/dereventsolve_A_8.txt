To generate a structure that looks like the letter "A", we can use the `ab_drop` function to create the desired pattern. Here is the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop('down', 3)
ab_drop('right', 1)
ab_drop('up', 3)
ab_drop('right', 2)
ab_drop('down', 3)
```

This sequence will create a structure resembling the letter "A".
