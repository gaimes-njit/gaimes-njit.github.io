To generate a structure that looks like the letter "A", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```python
ab_drop('top')
ab_drop('left')
ab_drop('bottom_left')
ab_drop('right')
ab_drop('bottom')
ab_drop('top_right')
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will create a structure that resembles the letter "A" in the database.
