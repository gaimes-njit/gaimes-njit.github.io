To generate a structure that looks like the letter "B", we can use the `ab_drop()` function calls in the following sequence:

```
ab_drop('up')
ab_drop('up')
ab_drop('left')
ab_drop('down')
ab_drop('down')
ab_drop('left')
ab_drop('up')
ab_drop('right')
ab_drop('down')
```

This sequence of `ab_drop()` function calls will create a structure that resembles the letter "B" when viewed from a top-down perspective.
