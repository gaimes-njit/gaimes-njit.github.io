To generate a structure that looks like the letter "B" using the given database, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
# Get the top-left vertical line of "B"
ab_drop('A')
ab_drop('B')
ab_drop('C')

# Get the horizontal line of "B"
ab_drop('D')
ab_drop('E')
ab_drop('F')

# Get the middle-left vertical line of "B"
ab_drop('A')
ab_drop('B')
ab_drop('C')

# Get the bottom horizontal line of "B"
ab_drop('D')
ab_drop('E')
ab_drop('F')

# Get the middle-right vertical line of "B"
ab_drop('A')
ab_drop('B')
ab_drop('C')

# Get the bottom-right vertical line of "B"
ab_drop('A')
ab_drop('B')
ab_drop('C')
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will generate a structure that resembles the letter "B" using the values from the given database.
