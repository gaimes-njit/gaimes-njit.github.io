```
find_letter_B(database):
    # Find the required letter in the database
    required_letter = database['letter_B']
    
    # Define the ab_drop function calls for letter B
    ab_drop_sequence = []
    
    # Build the top part of letter B
    ab_drop_sequence.append(ab_drop(0, 10, required_letter))
    ab_drop_sequence.append(ab_drop(0, 0, required_letter))
    ab_drop_sequence.append(ab_drop(0, 10, required_letter))
    
    # Build the middle part of letter B
    ab_drop_sequence.append(ab_drop(0, 0, required_letter))
    ab_drop_sequence.append(ab_drop(0, 10, required_letter))
    
    # Build the bottom part of letter B
    ab_drop_sequence.append(ab_drop(0, 0, required_letter))
    ab_drop_sequence.append(ab_drop(0, 10, required_letter))
    ab_drop_sequence.append(ab_drop(0, 0, required_letter))
    
    return ab_drop_sequence
```

Usage:
```python
database = {
    'letter_B': 'B',
    # Other key-value pairs in the database
}

ab_drop_sequence = find_letter_B(database)
print(ab_drop_sequence)
```

The generated `ab_drop_sequence` will contain the required sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to create a structure that looks like the letter "B". Note that the `required_letter` variable is obtained from the value associated with the `'letter_B'` key in the database.
