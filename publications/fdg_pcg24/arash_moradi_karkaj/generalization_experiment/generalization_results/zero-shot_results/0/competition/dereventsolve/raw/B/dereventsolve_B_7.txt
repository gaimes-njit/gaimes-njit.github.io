Here is a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls that will generate a structure that looks like the letter "B":

```python
ab_drop(0, 2)
ab_drop(0, 3)
ab_drop(1, 0)
ab_drop(1, 1)
ab_drop(1, 3)
ab_drop(2, 0)
ab_drop(2, 2)
ab_drop(3, 0)
ab_drop(3, 2)
ab_drop(3, 3)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will generate a structure that resembles the letter "B" when visualized.
