To generate a structure that looks like the letter "B", we need to retrieve the required letter from the database and return the corresponding sequence of `ab_drop` function calls.

Here is the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate the letter "B":

```
ab_drop("E")
ab_drop("F")
ab_drop("G")
ab_drop("D")
ab_drop("J")
ab_drop("A")
ab_drop("N")
ab_drop("B")
ab_drop("C")
ab_drop("H")
ab_drop("I")
ab_drop("K")
ab_drop("L")
ab_drop("M")
ab_drop("O")
```

By calling these functions in the given order, we can construct a structure that resembles the letter "B".

Note: The specific key-value pairs in the database were not provided, so the corresponding `ab_drop` calls are arbitrary and may vary based on the actual values in the database.
