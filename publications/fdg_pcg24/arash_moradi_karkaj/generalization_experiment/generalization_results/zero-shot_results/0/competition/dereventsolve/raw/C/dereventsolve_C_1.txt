To generate a structure that looks like the letter "C", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop(2) -> ab_drop(2) -> ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(1) -> ab_drop(4)
ab_drop(1) -> ab_drop(4)
ab_drop(1) -> ab_drop(4)
ab_drop(2) -> ab_drop(2) -> ab_drop(2)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will form a structure that resembles the letter "C".
