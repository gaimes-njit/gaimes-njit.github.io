To generate a structure that looks like the letter "D," we can make use of the `ab_drop` function calls in the following sequence:

```
ab_drop(0)  # Starting point
ab_drop(3)  # Top line
ab_drop(6)  # Right side
ab_drop(7)  # Vertical line
```

Explanation:
1. The first `ab_drop(0)` call is used as a starting point.
2. The second `ab_drop(3)` call creates the top line of the letter "D."
3. The third `ab_drop(6)` call creates the right side of the letter "D."
4. The fourth `ab_drop(7)` call creates the vertical line of the letter "D."

Putting it all together:

```
ab_drop(0)
ab_drop(3)
ab_drop(6)
ab_drop(7)
```

This will generate a structure that looks like the letter "D."
