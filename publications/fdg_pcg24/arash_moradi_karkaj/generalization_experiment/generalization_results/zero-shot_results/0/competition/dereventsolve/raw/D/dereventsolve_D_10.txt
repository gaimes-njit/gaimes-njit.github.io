To generate a structure that looks like the letter "D" using the `ab_drop` function in the database, you can use the following sequence of function calls:

```
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(2)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` calls will create a structure that resembles the letter "D".
