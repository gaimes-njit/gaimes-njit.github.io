To generate a structure that looks like the letter "E" using the database, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop('key1')
ab_drop('key2')
ab_drop('key3')
ab_drop('key4')
ab_drop('key5')
ab_drop('key6')
ab_drop('key7')
ab_drop('key8')
ab_drop('key9')
ab_drop('key10')
ab_drop('key11')
ab_drop('key12')
ab_drop('key13')
ab_drop('key14')
ab_drop('key15')
```

This assumes that each key-value pair represents a specific pattern or element needed to construct the letter "E". By dropping the keys sequentially, we form the shape of the letter "E".
