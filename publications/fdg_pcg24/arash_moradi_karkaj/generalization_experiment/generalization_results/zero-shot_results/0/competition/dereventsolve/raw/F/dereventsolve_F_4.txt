To generate a structure that looks like the letter "F" using the given key-value pairs, we can design a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls as follows:

1. Find the key "top_left" in the database and drop it using `ab_drop`.
2. Find the key "top_middle" in the database and drop it using `ab_drop`.
3. Find the key "top_right" in the database and drop it using `ab_drop`.
4. Find the key "middle_left" in the database and drop it using `ab_drop`.
5. Find the key "center" in the database and drop it using `ab_drop`.
6. Find the key "bottom_left" in the database and drop it using `ab_drop`.
7. Find the key "bottom_middle" in the database and drop it using `ab_drop`.
8. Find the key "bottom_right" in the database and drop it using `ab_drop`.

Here is the required sequence of `ab_drop` function calls that generates a structure resembling the letter "F":

```python
ab_drop('top_left')
ab_drop('top_middle')
ab_drop('top_right')
ab_drop('middle_left')
ab_drop('center')
ab_drop('bottom_left')
ab_drop('bottom_middle')
ab_drop('bottom_right')
```

Please note that these function calls assume the availability of a function `ab_drop` which is not provided in the question. The purpose of this solution is to demonstrate a logical sequence of steps to generate the required structure based on the given key-value pairs.
