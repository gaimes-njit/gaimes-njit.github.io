To generate a structure that looks like the letter "F", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```python
ab_drop('F', 1, 2)
ab_drop('F', 2, 2)
ab_drop('F', 3, 1)
ab_drop('F', 2, 2)
ab_drop('F', 1, 3)
```

This sequence will result in the structure resembling the letter "F" when rendered.
