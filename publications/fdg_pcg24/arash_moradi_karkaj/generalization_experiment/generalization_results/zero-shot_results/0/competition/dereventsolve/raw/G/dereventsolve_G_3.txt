To generate a structure that looks like the letter "G" using the given database, we can use a combination of `ab_drop` function calls.

Assuming the key-value pairs in the database have the following structure:
- Key: Represents the position of the character in the structure.
- Value: Represents the character at that position.

We can retrieve the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for the letter "G" from the database as follows:

```
# Retrieve the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for the top-left stem of the letter "G"
ab_drop(database['0'])
ab_drop(database['7'])
ab_drop(database['14'])
ab_drop(database['21'])
ab_drop(database['28'])

# Retrieve the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for the horizontal line of the letter "G"
ab_drop(database['1'])
ab_drop(database['2'])
ab_drop(database['3'])
ab_drop(database['4'])
ab_drop(database['5'])
ab_drop(database['6'])

# Retrieve the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for the vertical line of the letter "G"
ab_drop(database['7'])
ab_drop(database['14'])
ab_drop(database['21'])
ab_drop(database['28'])
ab_drop(database['35'])
ab_drop(database['42'])
```

Please note that the specific key-value pairs used to generate the letter "G" may vary depending on the exact structure of the given database.
