```python
# Database with key-value pairs representing the letter "H"
database = {
  "a": "    *    ",
  "b": "   * *   ",
  "c": "  *   *  ",
  "d": " ******* ",
  "e": " *       *",
  "f": " *       *",
  "g": " *       *",
  "h": " *       *",
}

# Function to drop the values in the database
def ab_drop(character):
    return database[character]

# Sequence of ab_drop calls to generate the letter "H"
sequence = [
   ab_drop("a"),
   ab_drop("b"),
   ab_drop("c"),
   ab_drop("d"),
   ab_drop("e"),
   ab_drop("f"),
   ab_drop("g"),
   ab_drop("h"),
]

sequence  # Return the sequence as the answer
```

The above code generates a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to create a structure that looks like the letter "H". Each `ab_drop` call retrieves the corresponding value from the database, representing a line of the letter. The resulting sequence of function calls will generate the letter "H".
