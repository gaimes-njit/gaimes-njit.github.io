To generate a structure that looks like the letter "H", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```ab_drop, ab_drop, ab_drop, ab_drop, ab_drop, ab_drop, ab_drop, ab_drop```

The structure will look like this:

```
  aaaaa
  aaaaa
  aaaaa
  aaaaa
  aaaaa
  aaaaa
  aaaaa
  aaaaa
```

Please note that the number of `ab_drop` function calls may vary depending on the size of the structure you want to create.
