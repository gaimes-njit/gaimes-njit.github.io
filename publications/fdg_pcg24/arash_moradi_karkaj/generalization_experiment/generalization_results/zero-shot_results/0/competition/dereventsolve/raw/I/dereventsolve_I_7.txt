To generate a structure that looks like the letter "I", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop(1,1)
ab_drop(1,2)
ab_drop(1,3)
ab_drop(1,4)
ab_drop(1,5)
```

This sequence will create the vertical line of the letter "I" by dropping the bricks one by one from the first column.
