To generate a structure that looks like the letter "I", we can use the following key-value pairs in the database:

```python
database = {
    'top': 'ab',
    'middle': 'drop',
    'bottom': 'drop'
}
```

To retrieve the required letter "I" from the database, we need to call the `ab_drop` function in the following sequence:

```python
ab_drop(database['top'])
ab_drop(database['middle'])
ab_drop(database['bottom'])
```

Resulting sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```python
ab_drop('ab')
ab_drop('drop')
ab_drop('drop')
```
