To generate a structure that looks like the letter "J", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(3)
ab_drop(3)
ab_drop(3)
```

This sequence will generate a structure that resembles the letter "J" in the database.
