To generate a structure that looks like the letter "J", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop('a')
ab_drop('a')
ab_drop('a')
ab_drop('a')
ab_drop('a')
ab_drop('a')
ab_drop('a')
ab_drop('b')
ab_drop('b')
```

This sequence will generate a structure that resembles the letter "J" when executed.
