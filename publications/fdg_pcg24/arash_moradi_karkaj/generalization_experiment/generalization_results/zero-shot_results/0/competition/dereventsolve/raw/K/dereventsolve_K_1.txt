To generate a structure that looks like the letter "K", we can use the `ab_drop` function to create the required pattern.

Here is the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate the letter "K":

```
ab_drop("up")
ab_drop("left")
ab_drop("right")
ab_drop("none")
ab_drop("up")
ab_drop("right")
ab_drop("none")
ab_drop("down")
ab_drop("none")
ab_drop("up")
ab_drop("left")
```

This sequence will create a structure that resembles the letter "K" using the `ab_drop` function.

Note: The specific implementation of the `ab_drop` function may vary based on the database and programming language being used.
