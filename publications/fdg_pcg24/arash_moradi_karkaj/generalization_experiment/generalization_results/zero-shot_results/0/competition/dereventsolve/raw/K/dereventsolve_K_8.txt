To generate a structure that looks like the letter "K" using `ab_drop` function calls, we can represent it in the following pattern:

```
a  b  a  b
a     a
a  b  a
a     a
a  b  a  b
```

Here is the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate the structure:

```python
ab_drop(0)  # Start from the top-left corner
ab_drop(1)  # Move right
ab_drop(3)  # Move down
ab_drop(2)  # Move left
ab_drop(3)  # Move down
ab_drop(1)  # Move right
ab_drop(3)  # Move down
ab_drop(2)  # Move left
ab_drop(3)  # Move down
ab_drop(1)  # Move right
ab_drop(3)  # Move down
ab_drop(2)  # Move left
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will generate a structure that looks like the letter "K" in the database.
