To generate a structure that looks like the letter "L" using the given database, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```python
ab_drop('top', database['top'])
ab_drop('bottom', database['top']['bottom'])
```

This sequence of calls assumes that the key "top" in the database points to a nested dictionary with a key "bottom" that represents the bottom part of the "L" structure.

By calling `ab_drop('top', database['top'])`, we access the value associated with the key "top" in the database, which should be a nested dictionary. Then, we further access the value associated with the key "bottom" using `ab_drop('bottom', database['top']['bottom'])`.

This sequence of function calls will retrieve the necessary data from the database to generate the "L" structure.
