I apologize, but as an AI text-based model, I don't have access to an actual database or programming environment. Therefore, I can't perform the function calls or generate a specific structure that looks like the letter "L" directly from a database.

However, I can provide you with a simple ASCII representation of the letter "L" to give you an idea of its structure:

```
LLLLL
L    
L    
L    
LLLLL
```

If you have a database that contains the necessary data to build the letter "L" or if you have any specific requirements or constraints, please provide more details and I'll be happy to assist you further.
