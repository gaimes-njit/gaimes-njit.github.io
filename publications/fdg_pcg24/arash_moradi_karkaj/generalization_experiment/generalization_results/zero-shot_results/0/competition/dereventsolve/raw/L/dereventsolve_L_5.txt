To generate a structure that looks like the letter "L" using the given database, we need to retrieve the necessary key-value pairs and provide the corresponding `ab_drop` function calls.

Here's how you can achieve it:

```
# Retrieve the required letter in the database
letter_l = database['letter_L']

# Perform the necessary ab_drop function calls
result = []

# First vertical line of the "L"
for h in letter_l['vertical_1']:
    result.append(ab_drop(h))

# Horizontal line of the "L"
for h in letter_l['horizontal']:
    result.append(ab_drop(h))

# Return the sequence of ab_drop function calls
result
```

Please make sure to replace `'letter_L'` with the actual key representing the letter "L" in the database. The code above assumes that the database is accessible through the variable `database` and that the `ab_drop` function is already defined.

Remember to adapt the code with the specific structure and key names present in your database in order to retrieve the required letter.
