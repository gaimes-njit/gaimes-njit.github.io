To generate a structure that looks like the letter "L" using the key-value pairs in the database, we need to locate the letters "L" along with their corresponding positions in the database.

Let's assume the database has the following key-value pairs:

```
{
  "A": [1, 2, 3],
  "B": [4, 5],
  "C": [6, 7],
  "D": [8, 9],
  "E": [10, 11, 12],
  "F": [13, 14],
  "G": [15, 16, 17],
  "H": [18, 19],
  "I": [20],
  "J": [21, 22],
  "K": [23],
  "L": [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]
}
```

To generate the letter "L," we need to sequentially drop the letters "A," "B," and "C" from the database.

Here's an example sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate the structure that looks like the letter "L":

```ab_drop("A")```

```ab_drop("B")```

```ab_drop("C")```

Hence, the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate a structure resembling the letter "L" from the given database would be:
```
ab_drop("A")
ab_drop("B")
ab_drop("C")
```
