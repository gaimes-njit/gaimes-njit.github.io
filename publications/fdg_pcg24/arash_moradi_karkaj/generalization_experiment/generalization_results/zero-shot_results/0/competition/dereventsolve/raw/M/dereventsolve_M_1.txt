To generate a structure that looks like the letter "M", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop("left", "top")
ab_drop("left", "middle")
ab_drop("left", "bottom")
ab_drop("right", "top")
ab_drop("right", "middle")
ab_drop("right", "bottom")
```

This sequence will create a structure that resembles the letter "M" by dropping points on the left and right sides in three sections: "top", "middle", and "bottom".
