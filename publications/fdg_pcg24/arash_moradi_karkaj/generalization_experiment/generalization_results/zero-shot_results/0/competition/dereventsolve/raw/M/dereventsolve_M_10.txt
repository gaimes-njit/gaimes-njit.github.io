To generate a structure that looks like the letter "M" from the given database, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop('AB')
ab_drop('AB')
ab_drop('AB')
ab_drop('C')
ab_drop('C')
ab_drop('C')
ab_drop('AB')
ab_drop('AB')
```

This sequence will arrange the keys and values in the database to form the letter "M" structure.
