To generate a structure that looks like the letter "M" using key-value pairs, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```python
ab_drop('bottom_left')
ab_drop('top_left')
ab_drop('top_right')
ab_drop('bottom_right')
ab_drop('top_left')
ab_drop('bottom_left')
```

Here, each `ab_drop` function call represents a movement to a specific location in the structure, based on the given key-value pairs. By following this sequence, we can create a structure that resembles the letter "M".

Please note that the exact implementation of the `ab_drop` function and the corresponding key-value pairs depends on the specific database and programming language being used.
