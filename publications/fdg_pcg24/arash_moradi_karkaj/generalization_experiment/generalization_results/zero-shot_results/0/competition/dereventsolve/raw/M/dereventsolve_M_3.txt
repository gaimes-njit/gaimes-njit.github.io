Here is a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate a structure that looks like the letter "M":

```
ab_drop("ab")
ab_drop("ab")
ab_drop("ab")
ab_drop("ab")
ab_drop("a")
ab_drop("a")
ab_drop("a")
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will generate a structure that resembles the letter "M".
