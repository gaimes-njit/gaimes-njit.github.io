To generate a structure that looks like the letter "M" using the given key-value pairs, we can define the `ab_drop` function as follows:
```
def ab_drop():
    return "ab"
```

Using this function, we can create the structure that looks like the letter "M" as follows:
```
ab_drop()  # Drop the first 'a' for the left side of the letter "M"
ab_drop()  # Drop the first 'a' for the right side of the letter "M"
ab_drop()  # Drop the second 'a' for the middle of the letter "M"
ab_drop()  # Drop the second 'a' for the right side of the letter "M"
ab_drop()  # Drop the third 'a' for the right side of the letter "M"
```

The sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will generate the structure that looks like the letter "M".
