To generate a structure that looks like the letter "M", you can use the `ab_drop` function to move the cursor in the required sequence. Here is an example of how you can achieve this:

```
ab_drop('down', 3)
ab_drop('right', 2)
ab_drop('up', 3)
ab_drop('right', 1)
ab_drop('down', 3)
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will move the cursor in such a way that it forms a letter "M" structure.
