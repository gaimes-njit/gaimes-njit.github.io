To generate a structure that looks like the letter "M", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
a_drop()
a_drop()
a_drop()
b_drop()
b_drop()
b_drop()
```

By calling the `a_drop` function three times and then the `b_drop` function three times, we can create a structure resembling the letter "M".

Remember, this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid sequences of `ab_drop` function calls to generate the same structure.
