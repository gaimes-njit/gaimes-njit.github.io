To generate a structure that looks like the letter "N", we can use the following key-value pairs in the database:

```
database = {
    "1": "ab_drop_down",
    "2": "ab_drop_up",
    "3": "ab_drop_up",
    "4": "ab_drop_down",
    "5": "ab_drop_down",
    "6": "ab_drop_up",
    "7": "ab_drop_up",
    "8": "ab_drop_down"
}
```

Now, let's return the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```python
sequence = [
    database["1"],  # ab_drop_down
    database["2"],  # ab_drop_up
    database["3"],  # ab_drop_up
    database["4"],  # ab_drop_down
    database["5"],  # ab_drop_down
    database["6"],  # ab_drop_up
    database["7"],  # ab_drop_up
    database["8"]   # ab_drop_down
]

sequence  # ['ab_drop_down', 'ab_drop_up', 'ab_drop_up', 'ab_drop_down', 'ab_drop_down', 'ab_drop_up', 'ab_drop_up', 'ab_drop_down']
```

Therefore, the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls required to generate a structure that looks like the letter "N" is: `ab_drop_down`, `ab_drop_up`, `ab_drop_up`, `ab_drop_down`, `ab_drop_down`, `ab_drop_up`, `ab_drop_up`, `ab_drop_down`.
