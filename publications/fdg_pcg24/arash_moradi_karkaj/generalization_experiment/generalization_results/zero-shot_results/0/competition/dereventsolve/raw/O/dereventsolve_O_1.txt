I'm sorry, but as an AI text-based model, I don't have access to a specific database or an `ab_drop` function. Therefore, I am unable to generate a structure that looks like the letter "O" using a database and `ab_drop` function calls. 
However, I can provide you with a visual representation of the letter "O" if that would be of any help:

```
 OOOO  
O    O 
O    O 
 OOOO  
```

If there's anything else I can assist you with, please let me know!
