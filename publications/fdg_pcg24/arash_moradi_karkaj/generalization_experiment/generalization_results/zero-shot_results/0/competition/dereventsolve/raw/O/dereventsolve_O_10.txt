Here is a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls that can generate a structure that looks like the letter "O":

```
ab_drop("O")
```

Explanation:
The letter "O" can be created by using a single `ab_drop` function call with the argument "O". This will drop all the letters except "O" and form a structure that resembles the letter "O".
