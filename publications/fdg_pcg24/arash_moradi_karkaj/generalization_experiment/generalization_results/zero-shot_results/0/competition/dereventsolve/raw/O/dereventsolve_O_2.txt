Here is how you can generate a structure that looks like the letter "O" using the `ab_drop` function:

```python
calls = []

# To create the top part of "O"
calls += ab_drop(0.5)  # Halfway down

# To create the left vertical part of "O"
for _ in range(4):
    calls += ab_drop(0.5)  # Halfway across

# To create the bottom part of "O"
calls += ab_drop(0.5)  # Halfway up

# To create the right vertical part of "O"
for _ in range(4):
    calls += ab_drop(0.5)  # Halfway across

# Return the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls
calls
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will create a structure that resembles the letter "O".
