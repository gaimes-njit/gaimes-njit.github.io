To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Q" using the `ab_drop` function calls, we can define the structure as a combination of lines and curves.

Here is an example of how we can generate the letter "Q" structure:

```
ab_drop("line")  # Draw the vertical line on the left side of the "Q"
ab_drop("line_bottom")  # Draw the horizontal line at the bottom of the "Q"
ab_drop("curve_right_up")  # Draw the curve from bottom-right to top-right of the "Q"
ab_drop("curve_left_down")  # Draw the curve from top-right to bottom-right of the "Q"
ab_drop("line_bottom")  # Draw another horizontal line at the bottom of the "Q"
```

Please note that the names of the `ab_drop` function calls mentioned above (`line`, `line_bottom`, `curve_right_up`, and `curve_left_down`) are just placeholders and may vary based on the actual implementation of the function.

Make sure to consult the specific key-value pairs in your database to find the appropriate `ab_drop` function calls for generating the letter "Q".
