```python
# Assuming the database is a dictionary called "database"

# Find the letter "Q" in the database
required_letter = database['Q']

# Define the ab_drop function
def ab_drop():
    return 'ab_drop'

# Return a sequence of ab_drop function calls to create the letter "Q"
sequence = ''
for line in required_letter:
    for char in line:
        if char == '#':
            sequence += 'ab_drop() +' '\n'
        else:
            sequence += ' ' + '\n'

sequence
```

The result will be a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls in order to create the structure that looks like the letter "Q".
