To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Q" using the database, we can describe the letter as a combination of straight lines and curves.

Here is the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate the letter "Q":

```python
ab_drop('down')  # Move down from the initial position
ab_drop('right')  # Move right to start drawing the upper part of the letter
ab_drop('up')  # Move up to complete the upper part of the letter
ab_drop('right')  # Move right to start drawing the tail of the letter
ab_drop('down_right')  # Move diagonally down-right to create the curve
ab_drop('right')  # Continue moving right to complete the tail of the letter
ab_drop('up_right')  # Move diagonally up-right to connect the tail with the upper part
ab_drop('up')  # Move up to complete the letter
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will generate a structure that looks like the letter "Q".
