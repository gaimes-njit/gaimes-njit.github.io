```
1. Find the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the letter "R" in the database.

2. Calculate the width and height of the letter "R" based on the corner coordinates.

3. Iterate over the database based on the width and height of the letter "R".

4. For each key-value pair in the database, check if the value represents a pixel in the letter "R". If it does, determine the position of the pixel relative to the top-left corner.

5. Generate the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls based on the position of the pixel in the letter "R". The `ab_drop` function takes two arguments - the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the pixel.

6. Return the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls.
```

Please provide the specific database and its key-value pairs to find the letter "R" accurately.
