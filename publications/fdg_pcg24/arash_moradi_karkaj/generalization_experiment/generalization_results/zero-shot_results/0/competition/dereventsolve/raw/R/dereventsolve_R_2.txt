To generate a structure that looks like the letter "R" using the given key-value pairs, we need to identify the necessary value from the database. Since you haven't provided any specific information about the values in the database, I'll assume that the letter "R" is stored using the key "letter_R". 

To construct the letter "R", we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```python
ab_drop()
```

Please note that without more details about the database and the values it contains, it is not possible to generate an accurate sequence of `ab_drop` function calls.
