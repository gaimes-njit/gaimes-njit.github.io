To generate a structure that looks like the letter "R", we can make use of the following database:

```
{
  "top_left": "R",
  "top_right": "ab_drop()",
  "middle_right": "ab_drop()",
  "bottom_left": "R",
  "bottom_right": "ab_drop()",
  "bottom_middle": "ab_drop()",
  "middle_middle": "R"
}
```

The sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to retrieve the letter "R" would be:

```
ab_drop()
ab_drop()
R
ab_drop()
ab_drop()
R
```
