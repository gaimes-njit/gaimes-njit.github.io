To generate a structure that looks like the letter "R" using the `ab_drop` function calls, we can break down the letter into its constituent parts: a vertical line on the left side, a diagonal line connecting the top and middle parts, and a horizontal line at the bottom.

Here's an example of how we can achieve this using the key-value pairs:

```
# Finding the required letter "R" in the database
ab_drop('vertical_line')
ab_drop('diagonal_line')
ab_drop('horizontal_line')
```

Please note that the key-value pairs and the corresponding `ab_drop` function calls may differ based on the specific implementation of the database. The example above assumes that the keys for the required letter "R" are 'vertical_line', 'diagonal_line', and 'horizontal_line'.
