Here is the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate a structure that looks like the letter "R" using the given key-value pairs:

```
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(3)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(3)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
```

Please note that without specific details about the key-value pairs in the database, it is assumed that the appropriate keys and values are present to generate the letter "R" structure.
