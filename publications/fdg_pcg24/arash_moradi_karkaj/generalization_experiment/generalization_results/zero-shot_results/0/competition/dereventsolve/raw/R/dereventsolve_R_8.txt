Here is a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate a structure that looks like the letter "R" using the given database:

```
ab_drop('top_left')
ab_drop('top')
ab_drop('middle')
ab_drop('bottom_right')
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` calls will create the structure of the letter "R" by dropping the required sections from the initial structure.
