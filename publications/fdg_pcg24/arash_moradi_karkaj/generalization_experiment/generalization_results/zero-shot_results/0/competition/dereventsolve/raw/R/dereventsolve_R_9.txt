To generate a structure that looks like the letter "R", we would need to find the required letter in the given database and return a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls.

Since the exact contents of the database are not provided, we cannot provide the specific sequence of `ab_drop` function calls. However, we can outline the general steps that need to be taken to generate the letter "R" using the `ab_drop` function.

Here is a general approach to generate the letter "R":

1. Access the database to find the required letter "R".
2. Identify the specific key-value pairs in the database that correspond to the letter "R".
3. Based on the structure of the letter "R", determine the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls required to generate it.

Please provide the specific contents of the database or any additional information to compute the required sequence of `ab_drop` function calls.
