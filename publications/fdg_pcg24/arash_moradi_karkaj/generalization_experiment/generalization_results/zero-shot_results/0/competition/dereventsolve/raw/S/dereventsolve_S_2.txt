To generate a structure that looks like the letter "S" using the `ab_drop` function calls, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the data for "S" in the database.
2. Determine the required sequence of `ab_drop` calls to create the letter "S".
3. Return the sequence of `ab_drop` calls.

Assuming the database contains the necessary key-value pairs, here is the sequence of `ab_drop` calls to generate the letter "S":

```python
# Step 1: Find the data for "S" in the database
letter_S = database.get("S")

# Step 2: Determine the required sequence of `ab_drop` calls
sequence = ""

# Start by dropping down from the top left corner of the letter "S"
sequence += ab_drop(0, 0)

# Move to the top right corner of the letter "S"
sequence += ab_drop(0, len(letter_S[0]) - 1)

# Move vertically down to the central point of the first horizontal line of "S"
sequence += ab_drop(len(letter_S) // 2, len(letter_S[0]) - 1)

# Move horizontally to the left until reaching the left edge of "S"
sequence += ab_drop(len(letter_S) // 2, 0)

# Move vertically down to the central point of the second horizontal line of "S"
sequence += ab_drop(len(letter_S) - 1, 0)

# Move horizontally to the right until reaching the right edge of "S"
sequence += ab_drop(len(letter_S) - 1, len(letter_S[0]) - 1)

# Move vertically back to the top right corner of "S"
sequence += ab_drop(0, len(letter_S[0]) - 1)

# Step 3: Return the sequence of `ab_drop` calls
sequence
```
The above code assumes that the `ab_drop` function takes two arguments: the row and column indices to drop the structure on.

Note: The actual implementation of the `ab_drop` function is not provided, as it is specific to the system or library being used.
