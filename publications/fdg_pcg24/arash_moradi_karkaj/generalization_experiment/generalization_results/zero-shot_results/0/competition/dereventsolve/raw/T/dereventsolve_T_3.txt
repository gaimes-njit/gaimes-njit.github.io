# Function to drop characters
def ab_drop(char):
    return ''.join([c for c in char if c in ['a', 'b']])

# Generate letter T
t_top = ab_drop(database['t'])
t_middle = ab_drop(database['a']) + ab_drop(database['b']) + ab_drop(database['c'])
t_bottom = ab_drop(database['t'])

# Print structure that looks like the letter T
print(t_top)
print(t_middle)
print(t_middle)
print(t_bottom)
```
Output:
```
bbbbbbb
aaaabbbb
aaaabbbb
bbbbbbb
```

In the given database, the letter "T" can be formed using the following patterns:
- The top part of "T" is the character 'b' repeated multiple times, obtained by using the `ab_drop` function on the value corresponding to the key 't' in the database: `t_top = ab_drop(database['t'])`.
- The middle part of "T" consists of 'a' characters followed by 'b' characters followed again by 'a' characters. These values are obtained by using the `ab_drop` function on the values corresponding to the keys 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the database: `t_middle = ab_drop(database['a']) + ab_drop(database['b']) + ab_drop(database['c'])`.
- The bottom part of "T" is the same as the top part.

By printing these parts in the desired arrangement, we can generate a structure that looks like the letter "T".
