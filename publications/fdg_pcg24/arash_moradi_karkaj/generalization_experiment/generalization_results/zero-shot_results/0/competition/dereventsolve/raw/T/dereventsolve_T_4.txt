To generate a structure that looks like the letter "T" using the provided database, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop('T_top_horizontal')
ab_drop('T_vertical')
ab_drop('T_vertical')
ab_drop('T_vertical')
```

Explanation:
- The key `'T_top_horizontal'` corresponds to the top horizontal line of the letter "T".
- The key `'T_vertical'` corresponds to the vertical line of the letter "T".

By calling the `ab_drop` function with the appropriate keys from the database, we can construct a structure resembling the letter "T".
