To generate a structure that looks like the letter "U" using the given key-value pairs database, we can utilize the `ab_drop` function calls to construct the letter shape.

Here is a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```python
ab_drop("bottom_left")
ab_drop("bottom_right")

ab_drop("start")
ab_drop("middle")
ab_drop("end")

ab_drop("top_left")
ab_drop("top_right")
```

This sequence will create a structure that resembles the letter "U" when the `ab_drop` function is applied to it.
