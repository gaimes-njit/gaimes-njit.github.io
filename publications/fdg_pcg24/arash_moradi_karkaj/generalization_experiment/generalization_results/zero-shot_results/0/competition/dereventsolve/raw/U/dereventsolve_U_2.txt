Here is a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate a structure that looks like the letter "U" using the given database:

```
ab_drop(0, 0)  # Starting point of the letter "U"
ab_drop(2, 0)  # Move right by two units
ab_drop(0, 3)  # Move down by three units
ab_drop(-2, 0)  # Move left by two units
```

The above sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will create a structure that resembles the letter "U" in the database.

Please note that the specific values used in the `ab_drop` function calls may vary depending on the size and scale of the database.
