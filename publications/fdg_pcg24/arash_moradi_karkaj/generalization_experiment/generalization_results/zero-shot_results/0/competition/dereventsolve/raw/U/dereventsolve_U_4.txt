To generate a structure that looks like the letter "U" using the given database, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```python
ab_drop('U', database['top_left'])
ab_drop('U', database['top_right'])
ab_drop('U', database['bottom_left'])
ab_drop('U', database['bottom_right'])
ab_drop('U', database['middle'])
```

Please note that the above sequence assumes that the database contains the key-value pairs corresponding to the different parts of the letter "U", such as `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right`, and `middle`. Adjust the key names according to your specific database structure.

If any of the function calls above are not valid in your context, please provide more information about the functions available in the API or specify the desired output format so that I can assist you further.
