To generate a structure that looks like the letter "U" using the given key-value pairs, we can define the `ab_drop` function with the following calls:

```
ab_drop('a')
ab_drop('b')
ab_drop('a')
ab_drop('b')
```

Explanation:
1. The first call to `ab_drop('a')` creates the top-left vertical line of the "U".
2. The second call to `ab_drop('b')` creates the horizontal line connecting the two vertical lines at the top.
3. The third call to `ab_drop('a')` creates the top-right vertical line of the "U".
4. The fourth call to `ab_drop('b')` creates the horizontal line connecting the two vertical lines at the bottom.

Please note that the key-value pairs in the database are not utilized in this task.
