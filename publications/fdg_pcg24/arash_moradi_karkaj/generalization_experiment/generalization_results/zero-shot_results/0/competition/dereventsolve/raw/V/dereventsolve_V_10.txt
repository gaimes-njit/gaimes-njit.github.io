```python
# Querying the database for required letter "V"
letter_V = database['letter_V']

# Returning the sequence of ab_drop function calls
sequence_of_ab_drop_calls = ''
for row in letter_V:
    sequence_of_ab_drop_calls += 'ab_drop({})\n'.format(row)

sequence_of_ab_drop_calls
```

Here's the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate a structure that looks like the letter "V":

```python
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(0)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(0)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(0)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(0)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(0)
ab_drop(1)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(2)
ab_drop(0)
ab_drop(1)
```
