print(generate_structure("V"))
```

Here, I have created a database in the form of key-value pairs where each key represents a letter and the corresponding value is a list of `ab_drop` function calls that will look like the letter it represents. The `generate_structure` function takes a letter as input, checks if it exists in the database, and returns the corresponding structure by joining the list elements with spaces.

Calling `generate_structure("V")` will return the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls that will generate a structure resembling the letter "V".
