To generate a structure that looks like the letter "V" using the given database, the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls can be performed:

1. Use the key "top_left" to access the top left part of the letter "V" in the database. The corresponding value will be a function that represents the top left part of the letter "V".

```python
ab_drop(database["top_left"])
```

2. Use the key "top_right" to access the top right part of the letter "V" in the database. The corresponding value will be a function that represents the top right part of the letter "V".

```python
ab_drop(database["top_right"])
```

3. Use the key "bottom_center" to access the bottom center part of the letter "V" in the database. The corresponding value will be a function that represents the bottom center part of the letter "V".

```python
ab_drop(database["bottom_center"])
```

Combining these individual `ab_drop` function calls will generate a structure that looks like the letter "V".

```python
ab_drop(database["top_left"])
ab_drop(database["top_right"])
ab_drop(database["bottom_center"])
```

Note: The actual syntax of the `ab_drop` function calls may vary based on the programming language being used and the structure of the database. The example provided assumes a dictionary-based database and Python syntax.
