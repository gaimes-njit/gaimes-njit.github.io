To generate a structure that looks like the letter "W" using the `ab_drop` function calls, we can use the following sequence:

```
ab_drop("left")
ab_drop("right")
ab_drop("left")
ab_drop("right")
ab_drop("left")
ab_drop("right")
ab_drop("center")
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will create a structure that resembles the letter "W" when visualized.
