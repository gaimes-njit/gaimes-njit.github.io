To generate a structure that looks like the letter "X" using the given database, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop('top_left')
ab_drop('top_right')
ab_drop('middle')
ab_drop('bottom_left')
ab_drop('bottom_right')
```

This sequence of function calls will drop the necessary blocks to create a structure resembling the letter "X" in the desired format.

Please note that the specific implementation of the `ab_drop` function may vary depending on the programming language or database system being used. The above sequence assumes a hypothetical function named `ab_drop` for dropping the required blocks.
