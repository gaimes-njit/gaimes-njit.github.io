Here is a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to generate a structure that looks like the letter "X" using the given database:

```
ab_drop('X')
```

Please note that since the database is not provided, the actual implementation of the `ab_drop` function calls may vary based on how the key-value pairs are stored and retrieved in the database.
