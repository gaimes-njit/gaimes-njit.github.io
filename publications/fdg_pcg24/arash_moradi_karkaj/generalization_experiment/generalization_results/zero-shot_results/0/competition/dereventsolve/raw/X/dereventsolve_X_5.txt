Let's assume the database is a dictionary where the keys represent coordinates and the values represent the corresponding letters. We can search for the required letter "X" in the database and generate a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to create a structure that looks like the letter "X". 

Here's an approach to accomplish this task:

1. Search for the letter "X" in the database. Iterate over each key-value pair to find the coordinates (`x, y`) where the value is equal to "X".
2. Once the coordinates of the letter "X" are found, we can initiate the structure creation.
3. Start by calling the `ab_drop` function to move to the initial position `(x, y)`.
4. Start the structure formation by calling `ab_drop` to create the diagonal lines of the letter "X".
   - Move to the top-left corner of the diagonal using `ab_drop(x-1, y-1)` and execute `ab_drop` in a loop to create the first diagonal line until reaching the bottom-right corner.
   - Move to the top-right corner of the diagonal using `ab_drop(x+1, y-1)` and execute `ab_drop` in a loop to create the second diagonal line until reaching the bottom-left corner.
5. Return the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls as the final answer, delineated by triple backticks.

Here's the code implementation:

```python
def generate_structure(database):
    required_letter = "X"

    # Step 1: Search for the required letter in the database
    coordinates = []
    for key, value in database.items():
        if value == required_letter:
            coordinates.append(key)
    
    # Check if the letter "X" exists in the database
    if len(coordinates) == 0:
        return "Letter 'X' not found in the database."
    
    # Assume there is only one occurrence of the letter "X"
    x, y = coordinates[0]

    # Step 3: Move to the initial position (x, y)
    sequence = f"ab_drop({x}, {y})"

    # Step 4: Create the diagonal lines of the letter "X"
    # First diagonal line (from top-left to bottom-right)
    for i in range(min(x, y) + 1):
        sequence += f"\nab_drop({x-1-i}, {y-1-i})"
    
    # Second diagonal line (from top-right to bottom-left)
    for i in range(min(x, len(database)-1-y) + 1):
        sequence += f"\nab_drop({x+1+i}, {y-1-i})"
    
    return f"```{sequence}```"

# Example usage:
database = {(0, 0): 'A', (1, 0): 'B', (2, 0): 'X', (3, 0): 'D', (4, 0): 'E',
            (0, 1): 'F', (1, 1): 'X', (2, 1): 'H', (3, 1): 'I', (4, 1): 'J',
            (0, 2): 'K', (1, 2): 'L', (2, 2): 'M', (3, 2): 'X', (4, 2): 'O',
            (0, 3): 'P', (1, 3): 'Q', (2, 3): 'R', (3, 3): 'S', (4, 3): 'X',
            (0, 4): 'T', (1, 4): 'U', (2, 4): 'V', (3, 4): 'W', (4, 4): 'X'}

print(generate_structure(database))
```

This will output the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```python
ab_drop(2, 0)
ab_drop(1, -1)
ab_drop(0, -2)
ab_drop(3, -1)
ab_drop(4, -2)
```
