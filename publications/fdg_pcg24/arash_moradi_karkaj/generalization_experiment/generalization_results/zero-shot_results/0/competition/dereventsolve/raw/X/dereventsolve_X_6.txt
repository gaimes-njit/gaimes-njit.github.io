Here is a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls that will generate a structure that looks like the letter "X" using the given key-value pairs from the database:

```python
ab_drop('X_top_left')
ab_drop('X_top_right')
ab_drop('X_bottom_left')
ab_drop('X_bottom_right')
```

Please note that this solution assumes that the database contains the following key-value pairs:
- 'X_top_left': represents the top left part of the "X"
- 'X_top_right': represents the top right part of the "X"
- 'X_bottom_left': represents the bottom left part of the "X"
- 'X_bottom_right': represents the bottom right part of the "X"

Please replace the placeholder key names with the actual keys from your database to obtain the correct sequence of `ab_drop` function calls.
