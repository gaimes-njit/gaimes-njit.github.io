To generate a structure that looks like the letter "X" using the given database, we need to find the required letter in the database and return a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls. 

Here's the solution using Python:

```python
def find_letter_in_database(database, letter):
    if letter not in database.keys():
        print("Letter not found in the database.")
        return None

    ab_drop_sequence = []
    letter_structure = database[letter]

    for line in letter_structure:
        for character in line:
            if character == 'a':
                ab_drop_sequence.append('ab_drop(0)')
            elif character == 'b':
                ab_drop_sequence.append('ab_drop(1)')

    return ab_drop_sequence


# Given database
database = {
    'X': [
        'a   a',
        ' a a ',
        '  a  ',
        ' a a ',
        'a   a'
    ]
}

# Find the letter "X" in the database
letter = 'X'
ab_drop_sequence = find_letter_in_database(database, letter)

# Print the sequence of ab_drop function calls
for call in ab_drop_sequence:
    print(call)
```

The output will be the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls needed to generate a structure that looks like the letter "X".
