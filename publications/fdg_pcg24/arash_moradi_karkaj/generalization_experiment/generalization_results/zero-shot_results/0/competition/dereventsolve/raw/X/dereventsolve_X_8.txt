To generate a structure that looks like the letter "X" using the given key-value pairs database, you can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop(key="top_left")
ab_drop(key="top_right")
ab_drop(key="middle")
ab_drop(key="bottom_left")
ab_drop(key="bottom_right")
```

Please note that the keys used in the `ab_drop` function calls ("top_left", "top_right", "middle", "bottom_left", "bottom_right") are just placeholders and will depend on the actual keys present in the database. Also, make sure to replace the `ab_drop` function calls above with the actual function calls you have available in the given context.
