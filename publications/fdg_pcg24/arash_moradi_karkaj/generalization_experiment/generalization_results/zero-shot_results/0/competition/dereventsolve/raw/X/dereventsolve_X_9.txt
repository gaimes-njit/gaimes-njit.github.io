To generate a structure that looks like the letter "X", we can make use of the following key-value pairs in the database:

Key: a, Value: `ab`
Key: b, Value: `drop`
Key: c, Value: `drop`

The following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls can be used to generate the letter "X":

```ab ab_drop ab_drop ```
