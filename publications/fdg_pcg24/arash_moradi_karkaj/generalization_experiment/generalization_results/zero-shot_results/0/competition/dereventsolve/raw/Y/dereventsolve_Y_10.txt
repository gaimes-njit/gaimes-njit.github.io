To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Y" using the given database, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop('Y')
ab_drop('YELLOW')
ab_drop('YES')
ab_drop('YAWN')
ab_drop('YET')
ab_drop('YOUNG')
ab_drop('YOUR')
ab_drop('YOU')
ab_drop('YEAH')
ab_drop('YUMMY')
ab_drop('YACHT')
ab_drop('YEAR')
ab_drop('YOGA')
ab_drop('YOGURT')
ab_drop('YOLK')
ab_drop('YARN')
```

Please note that the provided database is in the form of key-value pairs, and the value associated with each key represents a letter. However, since the database structure has not been explicitly mentioned or provided, the above sequence of `ab_drop` function calls assumes that the necessary letter "Y" can be accessed by passing the corresponding keys mentioned above.
