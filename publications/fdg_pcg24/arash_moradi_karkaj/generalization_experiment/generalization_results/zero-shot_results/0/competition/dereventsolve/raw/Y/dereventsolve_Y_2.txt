To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Y" using the given database, we can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop('A')
ab_drop('B')
ab_drop('B')
ab_drop('C')
ab_drop('D')
ab_drop('E')
ab_drop('F')
ab_drop('F')
```

This sequence of `ab_drop` function calls will create a structure that resembles the letter "Y" in the given database.
