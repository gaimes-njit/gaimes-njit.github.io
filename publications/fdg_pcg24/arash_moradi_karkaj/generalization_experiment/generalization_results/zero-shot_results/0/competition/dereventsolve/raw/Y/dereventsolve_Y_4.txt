To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Y," we can use the following key-value pairs:

```json
{
  "letter": "Y",
  "structure": [
    { "ab_drop": 1 },
    { "ab_drop": 0 },
    { "ab_drop": -1 },
    { "ab_drop": 2 },
    { "ab_drop": 0 }
  ]
}
```

This structure represents the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls needed to create the letter "Y" using the provided database.
