To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Y" using the given database, you can use the following sequence of `ab_drop` function calls:

```
ab_drop(database['top_left'])
ab_drop(database['top_middle'])
ab_drop(database['top_right'])
ab_drop(database['middle'])
ab_drop(database['bottom'])
```

This sequence will drop the required key-value pairs from the database to generate the letter "Y".
