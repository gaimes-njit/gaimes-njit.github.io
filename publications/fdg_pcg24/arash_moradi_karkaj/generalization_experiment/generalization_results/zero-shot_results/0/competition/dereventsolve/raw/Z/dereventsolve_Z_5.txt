To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Z", we can use the following key-value pairs in the database:

```
{
  "a": [
    {"ab_drop": 4},
    {"ab_drop": 4},
    {"ab_drop": 4},
    {"ab_drop": 4},
    {"ab_drop": 4}
  ],
  "b": [
    {"ab_drop": 1},
    {"ab_drop": 1},
    {"ab_drop": 1},
    {"ab_drop": 1}
  ],
  "c": [
    {"ab_drop": 3}
  ],
  "d": [
    {"ab_drop": 2},
    {"ab_drop": 2},
    {"ab_drop": 2},
    {"ab_drop": 2},
    {"ab_drop": 2}
  ],
  "e": [
    {"ab_drop": 5},
    {"ab_drop": 5},
    {"ab_drop": 5},
    {"ab_drop": 5},
    {"ab_drop": 5}
  ]
}
```

The sequence of `ab_drop` function calls required to create a structure that looks like the letter "Z" can be obtained by querying the corresponding values for each key.
