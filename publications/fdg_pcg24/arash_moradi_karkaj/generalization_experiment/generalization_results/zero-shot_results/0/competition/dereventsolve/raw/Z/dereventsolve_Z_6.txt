To generate a structure that looks like the letter "Z" using the given database, we can retrieve the required letter by accessing the corresponding key-value pairs. 

Here is the sequence of `ab_drop` function calls to obtain the letter "Z" from the database:

```python
ab_drop('top-left')
ab_drop('top')
ab_drop('top-right')
ab_drop('bottom-right')
ab_drop('bottom')
ab_drop('bottom-left')
ab_drop('middle')
```

This sequence assumes that the database contains the necessary key-value pairs for each part of the letter "Z". The specific keys used in the calls to `ab_drop` may vary based on the structure and organization of the database.
