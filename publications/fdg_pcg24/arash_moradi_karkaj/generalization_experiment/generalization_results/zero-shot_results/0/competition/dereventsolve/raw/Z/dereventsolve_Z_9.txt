search_letter("Z")
```
In this solution, we define a function called `search_letter` that takes the letter as an input. Inside the function, we create a database of key-value pairs where the key is the letter and the value is a sequence of `ab_drop()` function calls that represent the structure of each letter.

To generate the letter "Z", we return the value corresponding to the key "Z" from the database. It consists of four `ab_drop()` function calls in a sequence, representing the structure of the letter "Z".

Finally, we call the `search_letter` function with the letter "Z" as the input to retrieve the sequence of `ab_drop()` function calls.
