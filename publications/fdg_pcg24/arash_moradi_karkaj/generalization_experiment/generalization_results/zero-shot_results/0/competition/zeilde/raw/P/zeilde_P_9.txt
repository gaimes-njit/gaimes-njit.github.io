Steps:
1. Drawing the letter ""P"" with asterisks:
```
*****
*    *
*    *
*****
*
*
*
```

2. Listing the asterisks and spaces generated in each row:
Row 1: 5 asterisks
Row 2: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 3: 1 asterisk, 4 spaces, 1 asterisk
Row 4: 5 asterisks
Row 5: 1 asterisk
Row 6: 1 asterisk
Row 7: 1 asterisk
Row 8: 1 asterisk

3. Replacing asterisks with x and spaces with y:
Row 1: xxxxx
Row 2: xyyyyx
Row 3: xyyyyx
Row 4: xxxxx
Row 5: x
Row 6: x
Row 7: x
Row 8: x

4. Writing out each x and y for each row:
Row 1: 5x
Row 2: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 3: 1x, 4y, 1x
Row 4: 5x
Row 5: 1x
Row 6: 1x
Row 7: 1x
Row 8: 1x

5. Indicating the position of each variable:
Row 1: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
Row 2: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; y-5; x-6
Row 3: x-1; y-2; y-3; y-4; y-5; x-6
Row 4: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
Row 5: x-1
Row 6: x-1
Row 7: x-1
Row 8: x-1

6. Returning a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row:
ab_drop("b11", 1) ab_drop("b11", 2) ab_drop("b11", 3) ab_drop("b11", 4) ab_drop("b11", 5) ab_drop("b11", 6) ab_drop("b11", 7) ab_drop("b11", 8)
