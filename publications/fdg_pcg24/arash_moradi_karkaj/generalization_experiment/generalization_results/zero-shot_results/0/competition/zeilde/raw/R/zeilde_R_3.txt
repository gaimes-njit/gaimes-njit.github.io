1. Drawing the letter "R" with asterisks:
```
*****
*    *
*    *
*****
*   *
*    *
```
2. List of asterisks and spaces for each row:
```
Row 1: *****
Row 2: *    *
Row 3: *    *
Row 4: *****
Row 5: *   *
Row 6: *    *
```
3. Converting asterisks to "x" and spaces to "y":
```
Row 1: xxxxx
Row 2: xyyyy
Row 3: xyyyy
Row 4: xxxxx
Row 5: xyyxx
Row 6: xyyyy
```
4. Writing each "x" and "y" side-by-side for each row:
```
Row 1: xxxxx
Row 2: x-1, y-4
Row 3: x-1, y-4
Row 4: xxxxx
Row 5: x-1, y-2, x-2
Row 6: x-1, y-4
```
5. Indicating the position of each "x" and "y" variable:
```
Row 1: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
Row 2: x-1; y-4
Row 3: x-1; y-4
Row 4: x-1; x-2; x-3; x-4; x-5
Row 5: x-1; y-2; x-2
Row 6: x-1; y-4
```
6. Returning a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls for each row:
```
ab_drop("b11", 1)ab_drop("b11", 2)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 4)ab_drop("b11", 5)ab_drop("b11", 1)ab_drop("b11", 4)ab_drop("b11", 1)ab_drop("b11", 4)ab_drop("b11", 1)ab_drop("b11", 2)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 4)ab_drop("b11", 5)ab_drop("b11", 1)ab_drop("b11", 3)ab_drop("b11", 4)ab_drop("b11", 5)
