Use the ab_drop() python function to generate a stable structure that like the character <OBJECT>—the goal—while meeting all hard constraints. The dropping position and order are crucial and must be determined using techniques from the block-stacking problem. Think about it step by step. Consider the 2 constraints in part 5 first carefully, then think about what the shape of the structure should be. After that use ab_drop() function to put suitable blocks to form the structure that resembles the given character.

1. Role: You are a player of the Tetris game, aiming to generate a structure that meets the goal while satisfying all hard constraints.

2. Definitions:

Slots: The map’s width is equally partitioned into W slots where W = 20, with slots 0 and 19 being the leftmost and rightmost, respectively.
Layers: The map’s height is equally partitioned into H layers where H = 16, with layers 0 and 15 being the bottom and top layers, respectively.
Base: The bottom of the map, i.e., layer 0.
Map Initialization:
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

3. Environment: 
There are three block types:
b11: a square block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 1 unit.
b31: a horizontal block with a width of 3 units and a height of 1 unit.
b13: a vertical block with a width of 1 unit and a height of 3 units.

4. Tool: Use the following function to vertically drop a block from layer H such that its center is at slot y and drop earlier blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure.
def ab_drop(x, y):
    # x is the block type
    # y is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned
    
    # initialize the drop position at the top of the map
    drop_pos = (H-1, y)
    
    # drop the block from the top and move it down until it lands on the base or another block
    while drop_pos[0] > 0:
        drop_pos = (drop_pos[0]-1, y)
        if structure[drop_pos[0]+1][drop_pos[1]] != ' ':
            break
    
    # place the block on the structure
    structure[drop_pos[0]][drop_pos[1]] = x

After vertically falling down, the block will end up at either the layer on top of the base or a previously dropped block. The function takes two arguments: x, which is a block type, and y, which is the slot number from 0 to W-1 where the block center is aligned.

5. Constraints: The relevant constraints are as follows:
5.1 Stability: This is a hard constraint that must be met. Due to gravity, as in the block-stacking problem, a block must be dropped at a proper slot to ensure that both the current and resulting structures are stable and do not collapse. Incorrect placement can lead to poor weight distribution and structural collapse. Following are some stability rules: 1) A b31 block must be placed on a solid base (b11 or b13 blocks) to prevent overhangs; 2) Blocks should be placed as low as possible to reduce the risk of collapsing; 3) Structure should not be separated.
5.2 No boundary intrusion: This is a soft constraint that should be met if possible. Blocks should not intrude on the map’s boundary, both W and H, meaning the area of intrusion regions should be zero.

The final result shows the code only like the example in part 6. You need to generate a new result meeting all the given requirements.
