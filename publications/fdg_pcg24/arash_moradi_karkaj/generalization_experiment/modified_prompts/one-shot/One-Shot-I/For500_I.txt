Use `ab_drop()` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the capital English letter <OBJECT>â€”the goal.
Dropping position and order are crucial, and they must be determined using techniques in the block-stacking problem.

Role: You are a player of the Tetris game who aims to generate a structure resembling a given English letter. 
Follow Constraints. Read all lines, study all examples, before answer.

Result: The resulted code must not contain any loop and recursion. 
The code must be one instance, a series of ab_drop(). 
Do not create ab_drop() or any function. Use ab_drop() function.
No need to comment.


Definitions:
Slots: The map's width is equally partitioned into W slots where W = 20, with slots 0 and 19 being the most left and right, respectively.
Layers: The map's height is equally partitioned into H layers where H = 16, with layers 0 and 15 being the bottom and top layers, respectively.
Base: The bottom of the map, i.e., layer 0.
Map Initialization:
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]


Environment:
There are three block types:
b11, a square block whose width is 1 unit and height is 1 unit
b31, a horizontal block whose width is 3 units and height is 1 unit
b13, a vertical block whose width is 1 unit and height is 3 units

Tool: Use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop a block and drop earlier blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure.
The ab_drop() function takes two parameters:
1. A string indicating the block type: 'b11' or 'b31' or 'b13'.
2. A horizontal index representing a grid cell, where 0 corresponds to the leftmost column of the grid. This index indicates the center pivot point of the block being placed. 
    The structure is constructed from the bottom layer upwards.

Hard Constraints:
- Stability: Ensure stable structures with proper weight distribution to prevent collapses.
- Resemblance the English capital letter. 
-  Blocks must not exceed map boundary. It must not exceed the height by any mean. It is not possible to drop 'b13' at 0.
- No loop nor recursion in the resulted code. 
- No need to define function
- result is a series of ab_drop().

Soft Constraintss:
- Minimize the number of blocks when possible. E.g. 'I' with only ab_drop('b13',10).
- Avoid 'b31' as possible. 'b31' can be used only when the more bottom part supports at least 2 out of 3 widths of this block, or when the center of 'b31' is supported. Supporting blocks can be added if needed.
- Avoid dropping blocks on top of 'b13'. Blocks can be placed on top if there are more than two 'b13'.
- Letter can be small.
- If the letter is complex, focus on stability and omit certain parts if necessary.
- No for loop nor recursion.
