You are given a database in the form of key-value pairs.
The user will ask you to create a structure that looks like a letter.
Your goal is to find the required letter in the database and return a sequence of `ab_drop` function calls.
Your answer must be delineated by triple backticks.

Database:
```
L: b31-5, b13-4
```

Example:
User: Generate a structure that looks like the letter N.
Assistant:
```
ab_drop("b13", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 6)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 6)
ab_drop("b13", 7)
ab_drop("b11", 7)
ab_drop("b31", 5)
ab_drop("b31", 4)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 3)
ab_drop("b11", 4)
```

Generate a structure that looks like the letter <OBJECT>.
